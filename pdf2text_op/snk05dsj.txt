ABSTRACT

Manufacturing plant managers have sought performance improvements through imple-
menting best practices discussed in World Class Manufacturing literature. However,
our collective understanding of linkages between practices and performance remains
incomplete. This study seeks a more complete theory, advancing the idea that strat-
egy integration and enhanced manufacturing capabilities such as cost efﬁciency and
ﬂexibility serve as intermediaries by which practices affect performance. Hypotheses
related to this thesis are tested using data from 57 North American manufacturing plants
that are past winners and ﬁnalists in Industry Week’s “America’s Best” competition
(Drickhamer, 2001). The results suggest that strategy integration plays a strong, central
role in the creation of manufacturing cost efﬁciency and new product ﬂexibility capa-
bilities. Furthermore, strategy integration moderates the inﬂuences of product-process
development, supplier relationship management, workforce development, just-in-time
ﬂow, and process quality management practices on certain manufacturing capabilities.
In turn, manufacturing cost efﬁciency and new product ﬂexibility capabilities mediate
the inﬂuence of strategy integration on market-based performance. These ﬁndings have
implications for practice and for future research.

Subject Areas: Operations Strategy and Survey Research.

INTRODUCTION

Many manufacturing managers have placed their faith in best practices, hoping
that they will bring about desired improvements in manufacturing capabilities
and performance. The linkages between manufacturing practices, capabilities, and

Manufacturing Practices and Strategy Integration

performance, however, are complex and not well understood. Skinner (1969) ar-
gued that manufacturing ﬁrms suffered from an “oversimpliﬁed view” of practice-
performance links. He argued for a more complex view that considers the strategic
ﬁt between manufacturing capabilities and the environment. Despite the prescrip-
tions of Skinner and those that have followed, surprisingly little documented evi-
dence exists for speciﬁc relationships between certain practices and performance.
Moreover, given the prevalence of best practices, managers and researchers still do
not have an adequate understanding of the role that strategy integration plays in
achieving superior manufacturing capabilities and performance. Strategy integra-
tion at the manufacturing plant level is deﬁned as follows:

Strategy integration is the extent to which a manufacturing plant makes use of
interactions with other intra-organizational units to make its program objec-
tives and practices consistent with its internal and external requirements.

Two primary questions motivated this research study: If a manufacturing
plant adopts and implements best practices, is strategy integration still a neces-
sary condition for manufacturing success? Could strategy integration actually be
a means for achieving success? The study analyzes data from some of the best
performing plants in North America to investigate linkages among a set of man-
ufacturing practices, strategy integration, capabilities, and market-based perfor-
mance. The results suggest a more complete theory regarding practice-capability
and capability-performance links, thus extending related research streams in sev-
eral ways. First, the study examines the moderating role that strategy integration
plays in transforming manufacturing practices into capabilities. The research on
best practices suggests that implementation of best practices is sufﬁcient for busi-
ness success (e.g., Schonberger, 1996). This study seeks to provide a more complete
explanation of why those practices might be important contributors to success.

The second contribution of this study is to test empirically relationships of
manufacturing capabilities to speciﬁc manufacturing practices and to manufactur-
ing performance. While prior researchers have examined the associations of ag-
gregated manufacturing capabilities to manufacturing performance (e.g., Vickery,
Droge, & Markland, 1993; Droge, Vickery, & Markland, 1994), this study sought to
clarify the speciﬁc contributions of cost efﬁciency and manufacturing ﬂexibilities
to better market-based performance, accounting for the effects of strategy integra-
tion on capability attainment and performance. By including strategy integration
as a key variable, this research addresses the “black box” that relates to why some
practice implementation programs and manufacturing capabilities are more or less
successful than others. These ﬁndings have implications both for managers and for
future research.

The third contribution of the study is an examination of the potentially dif-
ferent relationships of manufacturing practices to three speciﬁc manufacturing
capabilities: new product ﬂexibility, process ﬂexibility, and cost efﬁciency. Prior
researchers have argued that the practices, processes, and strategies needed to sup-
port ﬂexibility and cost efﬁciency capabilities differ substantially (Ward, McCreery,
Ritzman, & Sharma, 1998; Saﬁzadeh, Ritzman, & Mallick, 2000; Boyer & Lewis,
2002). Others argue more directly that pursuit of these capabilities involves trade-
offs (Wheelwright, 1984; New, 1992). However, a growing literature suggests that

capabilities are mutually reinforcing, or cumulative (Ferdows & DeMeyer, 1990;
Noble, 1995; White, 1996). Differences in practice-cost efﬁciency and practice-
ﬂexibility linkages have not been empirically established. Thus, the study offers
potential implications for trade-off versus cumulative theories of manufacturing
strategy.

The fourth contribution is the further development of strategy integration
measurement. Operationalizations of high-level integration have aggregated mul-
tiple dimensions (e.g., supplier, customer, and so on) into overall supply chain
integration constructs (e.g., Rosenzweig, Roth, & Dean, 2003). This research de-
veloped and validated a measurement scale for a separate and singular dimension
of integration dealing with manufacturing strategic planning information. Others
have noted the importance of this type of effort given the manifest importance of
integration (Rosenzweig et al., 2003).

LITERATURE REVIEW AND CONCEPTUAL MODEL

Manufacturing Practices and Manufacturing Capabilities
Figure 1 depicts the conceptual model that summarizes our research interests and
objectives. The study focuses on ﬁve major manufacturing practices: workforce
development, process quality management, just-in-time (JIT) ﬂow, supplier rela-
tionship management, and product-process development. Each of these practices
has been conceptually and empirically established in prior research. Foregoing stud-
ies, which provide empirical analyses involving these practices, are summarized in
Table 1. This study distinguishes the focused, core elements of each practice area
from the more macro-oriented deﬁnitions sometimes used. For example, the term,
JIT, has been used to connote a manufacturing paradigm, comprising aspects of hu-
man resource management, quality management, and so on (e.g., White, Pearson,
& Wilson, 1999). This study focuses on the unique aspects of JIT ﬂow and pro-
cess quality management, as they are distinct from other aspects of manufacturing
practice.

Manufacturing Practices and Strategy Integration

Workforce development practices are aimed at improving workers’ technical
and problem-solving skills through empowerment, incentives for learning, cross-
training, idea sharing, and teams (references in Table 1; Gifﬁ, Roth, & Seal, 1990;
Schonberger, 1996). Process quality management practices make use of associated
tools to promote the continuous improvement of process capabilities. Important
related practices include a focus on quality performance, measurement, and com-
munication (i.e., feedback) of quality related data for improvement and control
purposes, and statistical quality control techniques (references in Table 1; Gifﬁ
et al., 1990; Kinni, 1997). Just-in-time ﬂow practices have the primary goal of
eliminating wastes in terms of material movement, work-in-process inventories,
and delays (Sugimori, Kusunoki, Cho, & Uchikawa, 1977). Important practices
include lot-size reduction, setup time reduction, facility layouts (e.g., cells) to pro-
mote smooth ﬂow, and pull or kanban-based production systems (references in
Table 1; Gifﬁ et al., 1990; Schonberger, 1996; Kinni, 1997). Supplier relationship
management practices promote closer involvement with fewer, select suppliers
by establishing long-term relationships, information sharing systems, certiﬁcation
and training, and joint investments (references in Table 1; Kinni, 1997). Product-
process development practices facilitate collaboration between product and process
designers as they seek to make the most effective use of manufacturing technolo-
gies. These practices include developing and integrating advanced manufacturing
technologies as well as ensuring that the constraints and capabilities of these tech-
nologies are considered during product design (references in Table 1).

The empirical studies listed in Table 1 have shown mixed results with respect
to practice performance relationships. For example, the research works of Flynn,
Schroeder, and colleagues summarized in Table 1 suggest that infrastructural vari-
ables characterizing quality management and workforce management contribute
more directly to overall manufacturing performance improvements than do speciﬁc
JIT practices. The recent study by Shah and Ward (2003), however, suggests greater
impact from JIT than from total quality management (TQM) or human resources
management practices.

Many practice-performance studies have concentrated on aggregated, overall
manufacturing practice or performance, ignoring roles of speciﬁc manufacturing
capabilities. In contrast, this study focuses on two primary dimensions of manu-
facturing capability, cost efﬁciency and ﬂexibility, deﬁned as follows:

r Cost efﬁciency is the demonstrated ability to execute plant operations using

relatively few total input resources.

r Flexibility is the demonstrated ability to adapt or change plant-level op-

erations with relatively little time or cost penalties.

Both deﬁnitions involve relative comparisons of capability, that is, relative
to industry competitors. The deﬁnition of ﬂexibility follows that of Upton (1995,
1997), who argues that ﬂexibility can be manifested in terms of the range, uni-
formity of performance, or mobility of operations. However, for the purposes of
our research the above deﬁnition differs in two ways. First, it addresses demon-
strated ﬂexibility as opposed to potential ﬂexibility (Upton, 1997). Second, while
ﬂexibility can exist at many levels, we concentrate on ﬂexibility types that exist
at the plant level and directly affect the competitive position of the ﬁrm (Suarez,


Swink, Narasimhan, and Kim

433

Cusumano, & Fine, 1996; Koste & Malhotra, 1999). At the plant level, researchers
have conceptually argued (Koste & Malhotra, 1999) and empirically demonstrated
(Upton, 1995, 1997; Dean & Snell, 1996; Saﬁzadeh, Riztman, Sharma, & Wood,
1996; Suarez et al., 1996) that two types of ﬂexibility exist: process ﬂexibility and
new product ﬂexibility. Our deﬁnition of ﬂexibility accommodates this distinction
by simply referencing the stimulus for change in plant operations. That is, change in
plant operations is stimulated either by the addition of new products or by changes
in demands for existing products.

While the impacts of the manufacturing practices of interest on cost efﬁ-
ciency and manufacturing ﬂexibilities have been discussed in prior studies, the
relationships of speciﬁc practices to speciﬁc capabilities have rarely been empiri-
cally tested. The study by Flynn, Schroeder, and Flynn (1999) showed that quality
management practices were positively associated with both cost efﬁciency and ﬂex-
ibility. However, the associations of JIT ﬂow practices with these capabilities were
not signiﬁcant. Dean and Snell (1996) showed that quality management was pos-
itively associated with strategic emphasis on both process ﬂexibility and product
ﬂexibility. The association of quality management with emphasis on cost was not
signiﬁcant. Product-process technology development and JIT ﬂow practices were
not signiﬁcantly associated with any of the ﬂexibility or cost emphases measured
in that study. Other evidence for speciﬁc practice-capability relationships has been
mainly anecdotal.

Our ﬁrst hypotheses are aimed at testing the associations of individual manu-
facturing practices with cost efﬁciency, process ﬂexibility, and new product ﬂexibil-
ity. For brevity, the hypotheses are presented collectively instead of stating multiple
hypotheses relating to individual practices.

H1: Manufacturing practices are positively associated with manufac-

turing cost efﬁciency capability.

H2: Manufacturing practices are positively associated with manufac-

turing process ﬂexibility capability.

H3: Manufacturing practices are positively associated with manufac-

turing new product ﬂexibility capability.

Of interest, however, is the possibility that the strength of practice-capability
relationships might vary, that is, certain practices would be more strongly related to
cost efﬁciency and others would be more strongly related to ﬂexibility. Such ﬁnd-
ings would have implications for the trade-off and cumulative capability theoretical
perspectives of manufacturing strategy.

Strategy Integration
Echoing Skinner’s (1969) seminal observations, Wheelwright (1984) argued that
effective strategies are characterized by synergies across key decision areas, espe-
cially those affecting manufacturing strategy and business strategy, other functional
strategies, and the competitive environment, respectively. The extent to which ﬁrms
establish these synergies has been discussed in terms of integration—the degree to
which actions taken in one area of the ﬁrm consider the organization’s strengths
and weaknesses and the actions taken in other areas of the ﬁrm (Miles & Snow,


434

Manufacturing Practices and Strategy Integration

1978; Miller & Friesen, 1978; Burgelman, 1983). The organizational practice of
achieving such synergies across manufacturing and business units is strategy inte-
gration, that is, consideration and synthesis of internal constraints, strengths, and
weaknesses, along with external market demands, opportunities, and threats.

This conceptualization of strategy integration is consistent with the arguments
of Skinner and others that a manufacturing plant’s investments and practices should
be consistent with the demands placed upon it by the limits of its own internal
capabilities and by the objectives of higher order business and functional strategies.
At the same time, it parallels the conceptualizations of strategic decision integration
found in the strategic planning literature (Miller & Friesen, 1978; Barney, 1997;
Porter, 1980).

In the manufacturing practice literature, the theoretical underpinnings of strat-
egy integration have rarely been addressed directly (Sakakibara, Flynn, Schroeder,
& Morris, 1997). Rather, the importance of certain integration-related practices has
been highlighted (Flynn, Schroeder, & Sakakibara, 1994; Sakakibara et al., 1997;
Dow, Samson, & Ford, 1999; Cua, McKone, & Schroeder, 2001). The complex
interactions of these practices with the implementation of other practices have not
been addressed.

Of key interest to this research is the potentially moderating role that strategy
integration plays in the relationships of manufacturing practices to manufacturing
cost efﬁciency and ﬂexibility. We posit that manufacturing practice implementa-
tions have the strongest associations with manufacturing capabilities when strat-
egy integration processes align the implementation of practices with organizational
goals. A manufacturing plant assesses proper strategy integration by comparing its
program objectives with its internal capabilities and with business objectives. Ef-
fective strategy integration, therefore, requires precision in deﬁning performance
objectives and in rich and frequent communications between the organization’s
planning and execution levels. Strategy integration processes gather and utilize
in-depth knowledge of manufacturing capabilities and corporate goals. For the
reasons delineated earlier, it was expected that plants having high levels of strategy
integration would exhibit stronger relationships between manufacturing practices
and capabilities than those that do not.

H1a: Manufacturing strategy integration positively moderates the
associations of manufacturing practices to cost efﬁciency
capability.

H2a: Manufacturing strategy integration positively moderates the
associations of manufacturing practices to process ﬂexibility
capability.

H3a: Manufacturing strategy integration positively moderates the as-
sociations of manufacturing practices to new product ﬂexibility
capability.

Linking Strategy Integration to Manufacturing Capabilities
At least three separate theoretical perspectives can be used to argue that strategy
integration plays a strong role in the development of organizational capabilities.


Swink, Narasimhan, and Kim

435

Strategic ﬁt theory argues that organizations should attempt to match resource de-
ployments with strategic demands (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967). An information
processing perspective suggests that richer communications among manufacturing
decision makers, workers, and corporate strategy representatives should collec-
tively lead to greater opportunities for waste reduction, because value-added and
non-value-added activities are more easily recognized (Rosenzweig et al., 2003).
In the knowledge-based view of the ﬁrm, strategy integration involves knowledge
dissemination and sharing activities that create new knowledge, which in turn im-
proves organizational capabilities (Grant, 1996).

These arguments can be further reﬁned with respect to manufacturing cost ef-
ﬁciency and ﬂexibility capabilities speciﬁcally. First, strategy integration activities
are helpful in determining and deﬁning manufacturing capabilities. For example,
greater strategy integration provides market and strategic inputs that enable man-
agers to know which aspects of ﬂexibility or cost efﬁciency are most important and
what levels of capability are required (Flynn et al., 1994). Second, researchers have
discussed the importance of the integration of strategic marketing and manufactur-
ing concerns when cost efﬁciency and ﬂexibility are pursued (Pine, 1993; Kotha,
1995). Others have documented the problems associated with strategic misalign-
ment in this regard (McLaughlin & Victor, 1995; Berry & Cooper, 1999). Kotha and
Orne (1989) contend that high levels of functional interdependence are necessary
for developing ﬂexible operations. Thus:

H4: Strategy integration is positively associated with cost efﬁciency

capability.

H5: Strategy integration is positively associated with process ﬂexibil-

ity capability.

H6: Strategy integration is positively associated with new product

ﬂexibility capability.

Manufacturing Capabilities and Market-Based Performance
Manufacturing capabilities have been posited as being important contributors to
business performance (Vickery et al., 1993; Miller & Roth, 1994; Ward, Durray,
Leong, & Sum, 1995; Flynn et al., 1999; Rosenzweig et al., 2003). However,
cost efﬁciency and manufacturing ﬂexibility capabilities are thought to inﬂuence
market-based performance in differing ways (Schroeder, Anderson, & Cleveland,
1986; Swamidass & Newell, 1987; Miller & Roth, 1994). Cost efﬁciency promotes
better proﬁtability and builds market share through the potential for lower prices.
In addition, it allows a manufacturer to adjust prices dynamically in response to
its market. Manufacturing ﬂexibility, on the other hand, grows market share by
offering greater responsiveness to the speciﬁc product or delivery service needs of
distinct customer groups.

The associations of these two speciﬁc capability types with market-based
performance in foregoing research studies have often been non-signiﬁcant, or in-
consistent (Feigenbaum & Karnani, 1991; Vickery, Droge, & Markland, 1997;
Narasimhan & Jayaram, 1998). For example, Rosenzweig et al. (2003) found that
process ﬂexibility was associated with customer satisfaction, but not with sales


436

Manufacturing Practices and Strategy Integration

growth. Cost leadership was associated with sales growth, but not with customer
satisfaction. These inconsistencies create the need for further research and hypoth-
esis testing. The following hypotheses describe the effects of cost efﬁciency and
both process and new product ﬂexibilities on market-based performance.

H7: Cost efﬁciency capability is positively associated with market-

based performance.

H8: Process ﬂexibility capability is positively associated with market-

based performance.

H9: New product ﬂexibility capability is positively associated with

market-based performance.

Taken together, H4–H6 and H7–H9 imply that manufacturing capabilities
mediate the relationship between strategy integration and market-based perfor-
mance. Thus, an interesting test of the proposed model involves the direct exami-
nation of a mediating effect. A full mediation hypothesis would suggest that strat-
egy integration drives better market-based performance only because the deeper
knowledge of organizational goals and operating constraints stemming from the
practice of strategy integration has positive inﬂuences on the development of man-
ufacturing capabilities. In this case, manufacturing capabilities would be seen to be
the generative means by which strategy integration practices affect market-based
performance.

H10: The association of strategy integration with market-based per-

formance is mediated by manufacturing capabilities.

METHODOLOGY

Study Sample and Data Collection
As this research focuses on best practices and performance, it was important to
include high-performing manufacturing plants in the sample, those that excel in
one or more key practices. Accordingly, the study sample included the past winners
and ﬁnalists in the Industry Week’s “America’s Best” competition as the target
population. Each year since 1990, Industry Week magazine has invited and received
up to 400 nominations of plants around North America. Judges appointed by the
editors of Industry Week select 10–12 winners and up to 25 ﬁnalists each year. The
selection process is rigorous, involving detailed analysis of data, and a two-stage
judging process. A team made up of experts from industry and academia further
reviews ﬁnalist plants. Personal site visits are conducted to validate winning entries.
A synopsis of the selection procedure and descriptions of the winning plants are
provided in the issue of Industry Week distributed in the ﬁrst week of October each
year (Drickhamer, 2001).

Representatives of Industry Week provided the researchers with contact names
and information about all of the winners and ﬁnalists for each of the years from
1990 to 1999. The list contained 145 unique plants that were still in operation (some
ﬁnalists in early years were winners in later years, and approximately 15 plants had
been closed). Representatives (mostly plant managers, vice presidents, or directors


Swink, Narasimhan, and Kim

437

of manufacturing) at each of the plants were contacted by telephone, inviting them
to participate in the study. A total of 130 plants either agreed to participate or to
receive the questionnaire and consider participation. All but a few of the ques-
tionnaires were distributed and returned via e-mail. Fifty-seven completed usable
questionnaires were received for a 39% response rate. Follow-up calls indicated that
most non-respondents believed they had insufﬁcient time to complete the survey.
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the 57 plants. The sample spans a
diversity of industries, plant sizes, and process types. Comparisons between respon-
dents and non-respondents indicated no signiﬁcant group differences regarding the
proportion of winners/ﬁnalists making up the group, the year in which the plants
competed, industry representation, or geographic location.

The Appendix provides a list of the measures. All measures utilized a 5-point
Likert-type scale. Four manufacturing managers reviewed the pre-questionnaire to
improve clarity and identify and resolve any unfamiliar or misunderstood wording.
In the case of manufacturing practices, the respondent was asked to rate the extent
to which statements regarding practice implementation applied to their plant, as
compared to the industry standard or average (1 = not at all, 3 = about the same,
5 = to a great extent). Respondents were asked to rate their plant’s manufacturing
and market-based performance relative to that of their principal competition (1 =
much worse, 3 = about the same, 5 = much better). This approach standardized
industry effects to some degree. Tests for differences in the variables across sample
groups deﬁned by industry, size, and production ﬂow detected only one signiﬁcant
(p < .05) difference. The average value of product-process development scores is
slightly higher for eight observations from the electronics industry than for other
industries.

We made use of two additional qualitative sources of information in the study
to aid our interpretations of the study ﬁndings: Industry Week’s case descriptions of
the practices and performance improvements at each winning plant, and personal
conversations with plant managers by telephone and in person at a national confer-
ence sponsored by Industry Week. These sources gave us a better understanding of
the general practice trends taking place at the plants, as well as speciﬁc examples
of the practices included in the study.

Development of Measures
To assess the manufacturing practices, we used or adapted measures from pre-
vious research where possible (sources in Table 1). Measures were also devel-
oped from construct descriptions in case-oriented studies when needed (Hayes &
Wheelwright, 1984; Gifﬁ et al., 1990; Schonberger, 1996). In addition, we adapted
and included measures from the Industry Week survey, and from the published plant
case reports (Kinni, 1997).

To construct the strategy integration scale, measurement items were drawn
from manufacturing studies of related communication practices where appropriate
(Flynn et al., 1994; Sakakibara et al., 1997; Dow et al., 1999; Cua et al., 2001).
The measures of manufacturing capabilities are grounded in seminal manufac-
turing research works (Hayes & Wheelwright, 1984; Wheelwright, 1984; Gifﬁ
et al., 1990), and in manufacturing capability studies (Ferdows & DeMeyer, 1990;

Miller & Roth, 1994; Saﬁzadeh et al., 1996; White, 1996; Kathuria, 2000; Boyer
& Lewis, 2002; Rosenzweig et al., 2003). Market-based performance measures are
similar to those used in Vickery et al. (1993) and Boyer (1999).

The fact that the measures were drawn from a comprehensive analysis of
well-established empirical and conceptual research literatures attests to their con-
tent validity (Bohrnstedt, 1983). Additional steps were taken to establish the uni-
dimensionality, reliability, and validities of the measurement scales. The scales
were puriﬁed and validated ﬁrst by using item-sorting procedures, and second by
conﬁrmatory factor analyses (CFA) of the survey data.

We conducted three iterations of an item-sorting procedure. An independent
panel of four to ﬁve expert judges was used in each item-sorting round (13 judges
in total). The judges in the ﬁrst round were three operations management faculty
and two PhD students. The judges in the second two rounds were manufacturing
managers who had many years of experience working in manufacturing plants.
Each expert judge was given a spreadsheet containing deﬁnitions of each of the
constructs included in the study, along with a randomized list of all of the items
generated from the literature and/or prior sorting rounds. In each round, each
judge was asked to assign each item to one of the deﬁned constructs. Items that
were not consistently grouped into their target constructs were considered for
elimination. We also discussed the results with each of the early-round judges to
understand problematic cases. Inter-judge agreement scores (Perreault & Leigh,
1989) and item placement ratios (Moore & Benbasat, 1991) were assessed in
order to determine construct reliability and validity associated with the item-sorting
procedures. Agreement scores for all of the judge pairs in the ﬁnal sorting round far
exceeded the acceptable level of .65 (Jarvenpaa, 1989; Moore & Benbasat, 1991),
thus suggesting a high degree of reliability for the scales. The item placement ratios
also far exceeded the commonly accepted percentage of 70% correctly placed items
(Moore & Benbasat, 1991), thus indicating a high degree of construct validity as
well as a high potential to be reliable.

CFA was applied to the survey data in order to further validate the scales. A
measurement model was speciﬁed for each construct and evaluated goodness-of-ﬁt
indices for evidence of a lack of unidimensionality. In three cases, items that did
not load signiﬁcantly on the latent construct in the CFA measurement model were
dropped. However, care was taken to ensure that the content validity of the scale
was not threatened. Item loadings and associated t statistics are provided in the
Appendix.

Table 3 provides values for Comparative Fit Index (CFI), chi-square, degrees
of freedom, reliability, and average variance extracted for each of the ﬁnal scales.
All of the ﬁt-index values are above the most rigorous requirements for acceptable
criterion values (Bollen, 1989; Hatcher, 1994; Hu & Bentler, 1999). Because the
limited sample size prevented a test of a complete CFA model, convergent and
discriminant validities were further assessed by constructing all 45 combinations
of pair-wise construct models (Hatcher, 1994; Ahire, Golhar, & Waller, 1996).
Each model was checked to ensure that the items loaded signiﬁcantly on the hy-
pothesized constructs, and that adequate ﬁt was attained (indicating that there were
no important cross loadings or correlated errors). The results indicated accept-
able evidence of convergent validity. Discriminant validity was veriﬁed using the

approach prescribed by Fornell and Larker (1981). The average variance extracted
for each construct was computed and veriﬁed to ensure that it was greater than
the squared correlation between that construct and any other construct. In addition
to this pair-wise procedure, we constructed a CFA model that included all of the
manufacturing capability and performance scales. The ﬁt statistics for this model
were also acceptable.

Predictive and criterion-related validities are measures of how well antecedent
scales are related to hypothesized outcomes, and how well they are related to the
criteria they are designed to assess, respectively. The predictive validity of each
of the manufacturing practice scales was indicated by a signiﬁcant correlation of
each practice to at least one of the manufacturing capabilities (Table 4). In addition,
each of the three manufacturing capability scales was signiﬁcantly correlated to
market-based performance, thus collectively suggesting their predictive validity.
Likewise, scores for the strategy integration scale were correlated with manufac-
turing capabilities and with market-based performance scores.

The criterion validity of the market-based performance scale was evaluated
by computing its correlation with a ratio-scale measure of market share. Each of
the respondents was asked to provide the average market share (as a percentage) of
his/her plant’s primary products over the most recent two-year period. Managers
are often reticent to report such data; only 38 respondents did so. However, the
correlation of this market-share measure to the overall market-based performance
scale was .460 (p = .004), indicating strong criterion-related validity for the scale.

RESULTS

Hierarchical moderated regression analysis was used to test the hypothesized model
in stages. Moderated regression analysis is preferred over subgroup analysis be-
cause it maintains the integrity of the sample; the loss of information resulting
from the artiﬁcial transformation of a continuous variable into a categorical one is
avoided, and utilization of the data is more nearly complete (Zedeck, Cranny, Vale,
& Smith, 1971).

The data were mean-centered in order to mitigate the effects of multicollinear-
ity in regression models containing interaction terms (Cronbach, 1987; Jaccard,
Turrisi, & Choi, 1990). Statistical power is a related issue. Variance inﬂation factor
statistics from the analysis suggested that multicollinearity was not a serious threat
to power. In addition, though the sample was small it was sufﬁcient given the lim-
ited number of parameters estimated in each model (Hair, Anderson, & Tatham,
1987). The models included two variables to control for plant size (number of em-
ployees) and production characteristics. For the production variable, a value of “1”
was entered if a plant had a predominately (>50%) continuous ﬂow production
process; a “0” was entered otherwise (batch, assembly, or job shop).

Table 5 shows the results of multiple regressions of cost efﬁciency (Model 1),
process ﬂexibility (Model 4), and new product ﬂexibility (Model 7) on practice
variables, respectively. These three regression models indicate that workforce de-
velopment and product-process development are signiﬁcantly associated with all
three dimensions of manufacturing capability. JIT ﬂow is signiﬁcantly associated
with process ﬂexibility. Process quality management and supplier relationship

Manufacturing Practices and Strategy Integration

management are not signiﬁcantly associated with any of the manufacturing ca-
pabilities. Models 2, 5, and 8 in Table 5 add the strategy integration variable as a
predictor of each of the manufacturing capabilities, respectively. Models 3, 6, and
9 add the interaction terms, thus providing a test of the moderation hypotheses,
H1a, H2a, and H3a.

Because at least one of the interaction terms in each of Models 3, 6, and
9 is signiﬁcant, these are the appropriate models by which to assess the support
for the hypotheses. These results support hypothesis H2, in that three of the ﬁve
manufacturing practices are directly associated with process ﬂexibility. The associ-
ations of the practices to the other manufacturing capabilities are dependent on the
presence or absence of strategy integration, thus H1 and H3 are not supported. The
associations of strategy integration with cost efﬁciency and new product ﬂexibility
are both highly signiﬁcant in Models 3 and 9, supporting H4 and H6. H5 is not
supported, as the association of strategy integration with process ﬂexibility is not
signiﬁcant.

H1a is partially supported by the results. A signiﬁcant

interaction
term suggests that strategy integration positively moderates the association
of supplier relationship management practices with cost efﬁciency capability.
H2a is also partially supported. Moderation is indicated for the associations of
workforce development and process quality management practices with process
ﬂexibility capability. The results also partially support H3a. Strategy integration
positively moderates the association of product-process development, JIT ﬂow,
and process quality management practices with new product ﬂexibility, though
the interaction terms for the latter two practices are only marginally signiﬁcant
(p < .10).

The second stage of the conceptual model posits that manufacturing capabil-
ities mediate the inﬂuences of strategy integration on market-based performance.
Three tests are required in order to establish that a variable, b, mediates the relation-
ship between two variables, a and c. First, a must be signiﬁcantly associated with
b. Second, the relationship of a to c must be established. Third, the relationship of
a to c must change signiﬁcantly when b is entered into the regression model (Baron
& Kenny, 1986). Our analysis follows this three-step approach.

Step 1: The prior tests of H4 and H6 (Table 5), and the correlation anal-
ysis (Table 4) indicate that strategy integration is signiﬁcantly
associated with cost efﬁciency and new product ﬂexibility.
However, signiﬁcant association of strategy integration with
process ﬂexibility is not present when manufacturing practice
variables are present in the model (Table 5).

Step 2: The results of regression Model 1 in Table 6 indicate that the
association of strategy integration with market-based perfor-
mance is highly signiﬁcant and positive.

Step 3. Model 2 in Table 6 indicates that the signiﬁcance of the
strategy integration–market-based performance relationship
is substantially reduced with the addition of the manufactur-
ing capability variables.

These results strongly support H10, as manufacturing capabilities signiﬁ-
cantly mediate the inﬂuences of strategy integration on market-based performance.
The results further suggest that mediation is accomplished primarily by cost efﬁ-
ciency and new product ﬂexibility. By extension, these results support H7 and H9;
cost efﬁciency and new product ﬂexibility are directly and positively associated
with market-based performance. H8, which posits a signiﬁcant process ﬂexibility–
market-based performance relationship, is not supported.

Models 3 and 4 in Table 6 examine the relative independent mediating ef-
fects of cost efﬁciency and new product ﬂexibility. The results of these two models
suggest that each capability partially mediates the relationship of strategy integra-
tion to market-based performance, yet both capabilities are required to explain a
complete mediation effect.

DISCUSSION

The results of this study suggest a more complex set of relationships among manu-
facturing practices, capabilities, and performance than those suggested or presumed
by previous theory. Speciﬁcally, the practice-capability relationships identiﬁed in
this study have important implications for linkage theory, for theories describing
relationships among manufacturing capabilities, and for managerial practice.

Cost efﬁciency and ﬂexibility are arguably two of the most distinct dimen-
sions of manufacturing capability (Ward et al., 1998; Saﬁzadeh et al., 2000; Boyer
& Lewis, 2002). They are associated with different structural and infrastructural
choices (Skinner, 1974; Kotha & Orne, 1989; Saﬁzadeh et al., 1996; Saﬁzadeh
et al., 2000), and they correspond to different market strategies (Woodward, 1965;
Schroeder et al., 1986; Swamidass & Newell, 1987; Miller & Roth, 1994). These
sharp differences suggest that certain practices would be more strongly related
to cost efﬁciency and others would be more strongly related to ﬂexibility. In con-
trast, a cumulative capability view would suggest that cost efﬁciency and ﬂexibility
might share common practices. The ﬁndings do not support the cumulative capa-
bility view, as none of the practices appears to be consistently associated with all


446

Manufacturing Practices and Strategy Integration

capabilities. Instead, each practice appears to be more aligned with one capability
or another. Next, we discuss this result in detail.

JIT ﬂow practice is signiﬁcantly associated with process ﬂexibility in the
data. This ﬁnding makes sense, as many JIT ﬂow practices are founded upon
improvements in process mobility (i.e., reduced setup time) (Upton, 1995). JIT ﬂow
is also associated with new product ﬂexibility, but only when strategy integration is
strong. The lack of a strong association between JIT ﬂow and cost efﬁciency in the
data is interesting, but not surprising. The speciﬁc material movement and inventory
waste reduction attributes of JIT ﬂow (as opposed to larger JIT paradigms) have not
been strongly associated with manufacturing cost efﬁciency in other studies either
(Dean & Snell, 1996; Flynn et al., 1999). From a theory development perspective,
these ﬁndings reinforce the importance of separating the focused elements of JIT
ﬂow from the other commonly associated infrastructural practices, which may have
more to do with cost improvements.

The results of the study show that product-process development practice has a
direct relationship with process ﬂexibility. This afﬁrms prior research results (Chen
& Adam, 1991; Upton, 1997). Interestingly, product-process development practice
also inﬂuences new product ﬂexibility, but only in the presence of strong strategy
integration. The difference in inﬂuences of product process development on these
two types of ﬂexibility is likely due to the internal focus of process ﬂexibility, as
contrasted with the external focus of new product ﬂexibility. Foregoing studies have
not addressed this complementarity of strategic integration with product process
development.

Prior researchers have highlighted the importance of cultural and infrastruc-
tural elements of workforce development practices in general (Sakakibara et al.,
1997; Flynn et al., 1999). The results of this study suggest that workforce de-
velopment practices are signiﬁcantly associated only with process ﬂexibility, and
then only when strategy integration is high. Improved problem-solving capabili-
ties, along with technical and cross-training elements of workforce development
programs are likely to increase worker ﬂexibility, which in turn increases process
ﬂexibility in terms of how worker capacity is allocated, what range of activities can
be done, and how quickly new activities can be learned. The implication is that a
high level of strategic integration is necessary for the potential beneﬁt of workforce
development activities (i.e., process ﬂexibility) to be realized.

Process quality management practices are associated with both process and
new product ﬂexibilities, but again, only when strategy integration is present. Pro-
cess variance reduction, standardized processes, and increased conformance as-
sociated with process quality management may provide greater process stability
on which to build greater ﬂexibilities. Increased strategy integration evidently in-
creases the positive potential of process quality management practices with respect
to both process and new product ﬂexibilities.

Supplier relationship management coupled with strategy integration was the
only practice found to be signiﬁcantly associated with cost efﬁciency. Descriptions
of supplier relationship management practices have tended to emphasize their ben-
eﬁts toward cost reduction and efﬁciency attained primarily through increased
purchasing volume leverage and through reduced uncertainty and disturbance in
product sourcing and replenishment cycles (Flynn et al., 1994, 1995a, 1995b;


Swink, Narasimhan, and Kim

447

Narasimhan & Kim, 2002). Stronger, more focused supplier relationships are also
thought to stimulate supplier investments in speciﬁc assets that may support greater
ﬂexibility. For example, Dell Computer’s close information sharing relationships
and proximity with key suppliers are purported to enable quick response to product
volume demand shifts (Breen, 2004). However, this type of beneﬁt from supplier
relationship management is not manifested in our data.

These results associate speciﬁc practices with one or more speciﬁc capa-
bilities, but no practice is related to all capabilities. Thus, the cumulative capa-
bility view is not supported. Prior research studies have examined practices and
performance in highly aggregated terms, neglecting the possibility that certain
practices have unique associations with certain dimensions of manufacturing ca-
pability. Future research that investigates these potential differences could lead to
the identiﬁcation of practice bundles (Shah & Ward, 2003) appropriate for improv-
ing manufacturing performance in targeted ways. This knowledge would advance
our ability to address the practice-performance linkage problem (Skinner, 1996).
The most important ﬁnding from this study is that strategy integration has a
central inﬂuence on the relationships among manufacturing practices, capabilities,
and performance. Strategic integration plays two important roles: (i) it moder-
ates the inﬂuences of manufacturing practices on the development of capabilities,
and (ii) it contributes directly to development of capabilities and market-based
performance. These ﬁndings extend prior research that has addressed manufac-
turing strategy simply as an infrastructural component of JIT or TQM paradigms
(Sakakibara et al., 1993, 1997; Flynn et al., 1994, 1995a, 1999). Where prior stud-
ies have focused on the presence and strength of manufacturing strategy, this study
has focused on the integrative nature of strategy.

More than 30 years ago Lawrence and Lorsch (1967) identiﬁed the integrative
capacity of managers as a valuable and scarce skill, yet this ability has received
little empirical study at the level of the manufacturing plant. Some have suggested
that in today’s marketplace the value of strategy integration is lessened because
high technological and market dynamism make needed capabilities difﬁcult to
fathom. Our ﬁndings argue against this view. Instead, they suggest that strategy
integration might actually create paths to greater new product ﬂexibility and cost
efﬁciency. In contrast, the data do not indicate a strong positive association of
strategy integration with process ﬂexibility. Additional research is needed to deﬁne
the role of strategy integration processes when process ﬂexibility is the primary
manufacturing competitive task.

How do plant managers bring about strategy integration? Consider our fun-
damental conceptualization: strategy integration occurs when clear knowledge of
strategic goals permeates the manufacturing organization, thus inﬂuencing actions
taken at all levels. The case studies of plants in the sample discuss a number of
methods for achieving this integration, stemming from two primary initiatives:
(i) solidify linkages with external corporate functions in order to acquire goal-
related information, and (ii) install effective internal communications channels.
Information acquisition methods include involving workers on marketing, product
development, and other cross-functional teams, and developing formal strategy
development processes. Plant internal communications channels include meetings
of all sorts (e.g., quarterly, monthly, weekly, start-of-shift meetings), and utilizing


448

Manufacturing Practices and Strategy Integration

other media such as information boards, customer satisfaction surveys, and progress
reports. These methods are not new, but this study suggests that they are quite possi-
bly the crucial ingredients required for plants to improve manufacturing capabilities
that lead to greater market-based success. Future research should investigate which
strategy integration methods are most effective.

The ﬁnal expectation of this study was that the effect of strategy integra-
tion on a manufacturing plant’s market-based performance was largely mediated
by manufacturing capabilities. The results indicate that cost efﬁciency and new
product ﬂexibility capabilities are means by which strategy integration practices
impact market-based performance. Although the logic of cost efﬁciency’s impacts
on proﬁtability and market-share growth through lower prices is clear, this link
has not been strongly indicated in prior capability studies. The results further indi-
cate that new product ﬂexibility has a much stronger relationship to market-based
performance than process ﬂexibility does. The lack of a signiﬁcant relationship
between process ﬂexibility and market-based performance surprised us. However,
Vickery et al. (1997) also found that new product introduction capabilities were
much stronger in predicting market-based performance than was process ﬂexibility.
It would be interesting to examine these linkages further, taking product and
market conditions into account. Researchers have suggested that cost-efﬁcient,
lean approaches are suited to producing a narrow set of products in stable and ho-
mogeneous operating and market environments, whereas new product ﬂexibility
is suited to producing customized products and service solutions in unstable, un-
certain markets (Woodward, 1965; Schroeder et al., 1986; Swamidass & Newell,
1987; Miller & Roth, 1994). The obvious question remains, in what market setting
is process ﬂexibility strongly associated with market-based performance?

CONCLUSIONS

While anecdotal reports suggest that best-practice programs lead to better market-
based performance, links between these elements have not been well established.
This study advances a more complete theory by arguing that strategy integration
and enhanced manufacturing cost efﬁciency and ﬂexibility serve as means by which
practices affect market performance. Importantly, the study indicates that manufac-
turing practices are mostly effective only when high levels of strategy integration
complement them. Strategy integration serves as a basis for improved cost efﬁ-
ciency and new product ﬂexibility, which in turn lead to better performance in the
marketplace. We consider this an important ﬁnding that may explain why ﬁrms
lacking strategy integration often ﬁnd that their investments in practice improve-
ment programs do not yield the beneﬁts they seek. The signiﬁcance of the results
suggests that future integration research efforts (such as supply chain integration
research) should consider including strategy integration as an important addition to
the inventory of various integration types, along with customer integration, supplier
integration, and so on.

The study’s limitations should also be considered. The study relies on self-
reported data from single respondents, raising the possibility of bias due to common
methods variance. Our personal contacts with the respondents, their relatively high
ranks, and high levels of interest in the study gave us a high degree of conﬁdence


Swink, Narasimhan, and Kim

449

regarding their relevant and expert knowledge. Furthermore, measurement items
were spread out over a fairly lengthy survey instrument. Mitchell’s (1994) guide-
lines suggest that these attributes tend to mitigate biases, and it is unlikely that
common method variance would artiﬁcially create conditions for signiﬁcant mod-
erating and mediating effects in the data. However, the possibility of common
methods variance cannot be entirely ruled out.

The sample for this study poses another limitation. We used a non-
probabilistic convenience sample, as one of our concerns was ensuring the inclusion
of plants that had high levels of practice implementations. The sample membership
spans different plant sizes and industries, yet it is not representative of the larger
population of manufacturing plants. It is possible that the ﬁndings are limited to
high-performing plants.

The ﬁndings of this study could be extended and clariﬁed in several impor-
tant ways. First, the sample size is small, requiring separate tests of the multistage
conceptual model, one stage at a time. The overall model advances the thesis that
the effects of manufacturing practices on plants’ market-based performances are
mediated by the interplay of manufacturing capabilities and strategy integration
activities. The analysis showed associations consistent with this effect. However,
we did not explicitly test the practice-capability-performance relationships in this
study. Ideally, such mediation effects should be tested with a larger sample via struc-
tural equation modeling. Second, retrospective or longitudinal studies would be
well suited for addressing questions such as the progression of growth in manufac-
turing capabilities due to various practice implementations. Third, future research
could expand the model to consider additional manufacturing capabilities related
to quality and delivery. A fourth potentially fruitful area of investigation would
be to investigate the ﬁndings of this study in light of different market and techno-
logical environments. Finally, one should consider the deﬁnitions of the practice
variables when interpreting the results of this study. It is important to remember
that the study focuses on speciﬁc practices, not on grander practice paradigms
such as TQM or JIT. We leave it to future research to investigate these issues.
