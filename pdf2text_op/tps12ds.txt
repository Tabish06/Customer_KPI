ABSTRACT

Existing research focuses on the positive returns to operational performance of ﬁrms’
supply chain integration (SCI) with suppliers, buyers, and customers. We draw on
differentiation-integration duality and contingency theory to suggest that manufacturing
ﬁrms should seek to achieve both integration through supply chain coordination activ-
ities and differentiation through modularity-based manufacturing practices (MBMP).
Using a sample of 261 manufacturing ﬁrms, we identify an inverse U-shaped relation-
ship between SCI and operational performance. Furthermore, we ﬁnd support for the
importance of differentiation-integration duality as a ﬁt between high levels of SCI and
high levels of MBMP results in enhanced operational performance. We ﬁnd support
for a contingency perspective as ﬁt is especially critical at higher levels of environ-
mental uncertainty. Implications for theory, practice, and further research are suggested.

INTRODUCTION

Supply chain integration (SCI) is the degree to which ﬁrms strategically col-
laborate with their supply chain partners and manage intra- and interorgani-
zational processes (Flynn, Huo, & Zhao, 2010). A large body of research in-
dicates that ﬁrms can realize increasing returns from enhanced customer, sup-
plier, and internal integration efforts (Narasimhan, Swink, & Viswanathan, 2010).

Managing Differentiation-Integration Duality

For example, SCI can help ﬁrms improve responsiveness to demand (Frohlich
& Westbrook, 2002), better allocate resources (Narasimhan & Kim, 2002), and
reduce costs through improved process and distribution efﬁciency (Frohlich &
Westbrook, 2001). Supported by interorganizational information technology (IT),
which enables sharing of large amounts of data, information, and knowledge
along the supply chain, SCI has been shown to improve buyer–supplier co-
ordination and performance (Subramani, 2004; Ward & Zhou, 2006; Sanders,
2008; Dong, Xu, & Zhu, 2009; Klein & Rai, 2009; Mithas, Ramasubbu, &
Sambamurthy, 2011).

Although the potential beneﬁts of SCI are generally recognized, a closer study
of the extant research suggests inconsistencies in ﬁndings regarding its impact on
operational performance (Germain & Iyer, 2006; Flynn et al., 2010). Further, re-
cent research suggests that returns from integration may not be universal, but rather
contingent on ﬁrm-speciﬁc and environmental factors (Turkulainen, 2008; Wong,
Boon-itt, & Wong, 2011). For example, Chung, Talluri, and Narasimhan (2010)
ﬁnd differential beneﬁts of ﬂexibility to suppliers, with high ﬂexibility beneﬁting
lower price suppliers over quantity ﬂexibility suppliers. Similarly, Bozarth, Wars-
ing, Flynn, and Flynn (2009) report that the nature and extent of supply chain
complexity impacts organizational performance. Sousa and Voss (2008) suggest
that contingency perspectives may be central to addressing mixed ﬁndings in op-
erations management.

Scholars highlight the need for further research to identify variables that
impact the relationship between SCI and operational performance (Narasimhan
& Kim, 2002; Zacharia, Nix, & Lusch, 2011). Wong et al. (2011) suggest fur-
ther research is needed on interactions and combined performance impacts among
SCI dimensions, and the joint effects of environmental uncertainty and SCI. More
speciﬁcally, Azadegan and Dooley (2010) call for the examination of product mod-
ularity as a contributing variable, as well as other researchers who emphasize the
need to explore the effectiveness of modularity (Subramani, 2004; Pil & Cohen,
2006). A recent modularity literature review (Campagnolo & Canuffo, 2010) out-
lines the need for further investigation on the relationship between modularity and
performance, especially considering the conﬁguration of the supply chain, market,
and industry-speciﬁc factors.

This study responds to these calls. Drawing on contingency theory and the
differentiation-integration duality from Lawrence and Lorsch (1967), we propose
that SCI may not be universally beneﬁcial as widely accepted in the supply chain lit-
erature, but beneﬁts may be contingent on ﬁrm-speciﬁc and environmental factors
(Tomlin, 2006). We ﬁrst examine the potential for an inverse U-shaped relation-
ship between SCI and operational performance. Next, we explore Lawrence and
Lorsch’s (1967) suggestion that higher performance is achieved by systems that
simultaneously promote both differentiation of organizational units and integration
of routines and processes. Differentiation is the separation of activities into distinct
organizational units, whereas integration refers to their uniﬁcation (Lawrence &
Lorsch, 1967). As applied to SCI, differentiation-integration duality can be a useful
framework for explaining how ﬁrms can enhance SCI by concurrently engaging in
modularity-based manufacturing practices (MBMP) for product design, produc-
tion process design, and organizational design (Tu, Vonderembse, Ragu-Nathan,
& Ragu-Nathan, 2004).

SCI requires transaction-speciﬁc investments to effectively coordinate with
supply chain members (Hobbs, 1996; Subramani, 2004) but can potentially limit
ﬁrms’ development of unique bundles of resources. Furthermore, excessive in-
tegration with outside stakeholders can create competency traps (Siggelkow &
Levinthal, 2005), which can negatively affect performance. MBMP capabilities
aid the implementation of supplier, customer, and internal integration. Further,
we posit that the ﬁt between SCI and MBMP becomes especially critical under
higher levels of environmental uncertainty, as supported by contingency theory
(Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967). Using a sample of 261 manufacturing ﬁrms and mod-
erated polynomial regression, we ﬁnd support for the proposed framework. The
speciﬁc research questions we investigate are: (i) Why are some ﬁrms able to de-
velop more effective operational responses to environmental uncertainty using SCI
and MBMP? (ii) How can ﬁrms manage differentiation-integration duality through
SCI and MBMP? and (iii) What patterns of differentiation and integration through
SCI and MBMP are associated with operational performance under various levels
of environmental uncertainty?

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. The next section intro-
duces the theoretical background of the model and hypotheses based on literatures
associated with SCI, operational performance, MBMP, and environmental un-
certainty. The research sample and methodology are then presented. Results are
discussed, and the ﬁnal section highlights the contributions to theory and practice,
limitations, and future research directions.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES
DEVELOPMENT

SCI and Operational Performance
SCI is a key component of supply chain management (Chen, Daugherty, & Landry,
2009) and has been extensively studied (Mabert & Venkataraman, 1998; Fawcett
& Magnan, 2002; Chen, Mattioda, & Daugherty, 2007). Integration enhances
operational performance in several ways. This includes developing responses to
complex and uncertain environments (Frohlich & Westbrook, 2002) and pooling
resources and capabilities across supply chain participants (Frohlich & Westbrook,
2001; Narasimhan & Kim, 2002; Swink, Narasimhan, & Wang, 2007). Through in-
creased interorganizational coordination, ﬁrms can access and leverage resources
available in the supply chain and promote division of labor (Li, Ragu-Nathan,
Ragu-Nathan, & Subba Rao, 2006). With the support of IT, buyer–supplier co-
ordination and performance are improved (Subramani, 2004; Dong et al., 2009;
Klein & Rai 2009; Mithas et al., 2011). IT has made possible the sharing of large
amounts of information along the supply chain, allowing for the transmission and
processing of information necessary for synchronous and asynchronous decision
making (Kearns & Lederer, 2003). IT enables ﬁrms to unbundle information ﬂows
from physical ﬂows and share information with their supply chain partners to
create information-based capabilities for superior demand planning, staging, and
movement of physical products, and the streamlining of complex ﬁnancial pro-
cesses (Rai, Patnayakuni, & Seth, 2006). As such, IT supports SCI, which in turn
leads to signiﬁcant and sustained performance gains.

Managing Differentiation-Integration Duality

A large body of research explores the relationship between SCI and perfor-
mance, but is characterized by inconsistencies in deﬁnitions, measurement, and
outcomes (Pagell, 2004; Fabbe-Costes & Jahre, 2008; Flynn et al., 2010). Further-
more, Fabbe-Costes and Jahre’s (2008) literature review reveals that research on
SCI’s impact on performance uses a variety of performance measures, from pure
operational logistics performance to broad strategic performance. Researchers call
for further empirical research on the relationship between SCI and performance
(Fabbe-Costes & Jahre, 2008), and identify the need for a contingency approach
(Flynn et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2011).

We view operational performance and SCI as multidimensional. Opera-
tional performance includes four outcomes: delivery, production cost, product
quality, and production ﬂexibility. Consistent with Pagell (2004), Flynn et al.
(2010), and Wong et al. (2011), we consider SCI as having three main com-
ponents: internal integration, supplier integration, and customer integration. We
adapt Flynn, Huo, and Zhao’s (2010, p. 59) deﬁnition of SCI as “the degree
to which a manufacturer strategically collaborates with its supply chain part-
ners and collaboratively manages intra- and interorganization processes.” The
strategic collaboration element captures the extent of ongoing, mutually bene-
ﬁcial activities with customers and suppliers. These external integration efforts
structure interorganizational strategies and processes. SCI also includes internal
integration efforts within the manufacturer, to include the structure, systems, and
processes.

Although SCI increases responsiveness to enhance supply chain perfor-
mance, it decreases distinctiveness (Swink et al., 2007). Firms with greater SCI tend
to devote more attention to systems integration, planning, and forecasting (Saeed,
Malhotra, & Grover, 2011). To coordinate knowledge and resources across the sup-
ply chain, participants must develop transaction-speciﬁc knowledge and resources,
and must adapt resources and capabilities to supply chain partners (Subramani,
2004; Sanders, 2008). From an individual ﬁrm perspective, such suboptimal re-
source allocation could reduce long-term performance as distinctive resources
leading to ﬁrm competitive advantage are sidelined in favor of resource conﬁgu-
rations for the “greater good” of the supply chain.

SCI and performance outcomes do not always have a positive relationship.
Koufteros, Vonderembse, and Jayaram (2005) ﬁnd that supplier product integration
is signiﬁcantly negatively related to product innovation and that supplier process
integration has a negative effect on quality, although not statistically signiﬁcant.
Stank, Keller, and Closs (2001) examine the impact of ﬁve types of integration
on overall logistics performance, ﬁnding that customer and internal integration
are most critical for performance. However, there is mixed empirical support for
the impact of supplier integration on performance. Swink et al. (2007) report that
manufacturers with supplier integration have poorer quality and potentially poorer
new product ﬂexibility. Furthermore, they ﬁnd that customer integration is not
signiﬁcantly related to cost, quality, delivery, process ﬂexibility, or new product
ﬂexibility. Although coordination costs are not explicitly explained in the context
of SCI, increasing stakeholder integration in new product development efforts has
both positive and negative effects on new product success and could result in longer
lead times (Swink & Song, 2007).

Contingency theory may be a useful framework for explaining the inconsis-
tencies in these ﬁndings. We draw on contingency theory to explain that increasing
returns from integration are contingent on ﬁrm and environmental factors.

Contingency Theory Applied to SCI
Contingency theory contends that there is no single best way to design, organize,
or manage an organization; but to maximize performance, an organization should
match its strategies, structures, and processes with its environment (Lawrence &
Lorsch, 1967; Thompson, 1967; Miller, 1992; Donaldson, 2001; Sinha & Van
de Ven, 2005). Thus, an organization’s success depends on the extent to which
its chosen strategy is aligned with its structure (Chandler, 1962; Lawrence &
Lorsch, 1967; Galbraith, 1973). This alignment, termed as ﬁt in the strategic
management literature, explains many ﬁndings in operations and supply chain
research (Koufteros et al., 2005; Sousa & Voss, 2008; Flynn et al., 2010; Qi, Zhao,
& Sheu, 2011).

The concept of ﬁt has a broad utility to various areas of theory develop-
ment as it implies that there is a match between two theoretically related variables
without reference to a criterion variable (Van de Ven & Drazin, 1985). Applica-
tions of contingency theory and the notion of ﬁt are used extensively in the IT
literature to explain inconsistencies in ﬁndings between IT deployment and use,
ﬁrm integration, and performance outcomes (Kearns & Lederer, 2003; Subramani,
2004; Demirhan, Jacob, & Raghunathan, 2007; Klein & Rai, 2009; Mani, Barua, &
Whinston, 2010; Mithas et al., 2011). Results show that performance outcomes are
contingent on many factors such as pattern of IT use (Lim, Richardson, & Roberts,
2004; Sriram & Stump, 2004; Subramani, 2004) and technological “readiness” of
ﬁrms (Khazanchi, 2005).

Applied to SCI, this suggests that integration resources and activities need to
be aligned with the ﬁrm’s competitive strategy. Firms with insufﬁcient SCI levels
will not achieve returns in terms of delivery, production cost, product quality, and
production ﬂexibility. However, extensive internal and external integration may
result in unnecessary costs such as acquisition of relationship-speciﬁc assets (Sub-
ramani, 2004). Furthermore, the manufacturing ﬁrm may lose important ﬂexibility
and compromise its ability to meet operational goals, especially at requisite cost
and quality levels (Flynn et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2011).

A close review of the extant literature has identiﬁed inconsistencies in out-
comes, and has revealed the fallacy of assuming a universally direct positive
relationship between SCI and performance (Turkulainen, 2008). This leads to our
ﬁrst hypothesis:

H1: SCI has an inverse U-shaped relationship with operational performance.

Achieving Differentiation-Integration Duality
The established inconsistencies in the extant literature regarding beneﬁts of SCI
on operational performance warrant further study of speciﬁc ﬁrm strategies that
may enhance this relationship. In one of the seminal studies of contingency theory,
Lawrence and Lorsch (1967) proposed an open systems theory regarding how or-
ganizational units adapt to meet the needs of their environment. A central theme in

Managing Differentiation-Integration Duality

their work is the need for organizations to achieve both differentiation and integra-
tion. They deﬁne differentiation as “the state of segmentation of the organizational
system into subsystems, each of which tends to develop particular attributes in re-
lation to the requirements posed by its relevant external environment [and]. . . the
behavioral attributes of members of organizational systems” (Lawrence & Lorsch,
1967, p. 3–4). Differentiation is a consequence of local adaptation to unit-speciﬁc
tasks (Dougherty, 2001) and increases the responsiveness of the organization (Gu-
lati, Lawrence, & Puranam, 2005). Integration is “the process of achieving unity of
effort among the various subsystems in the accomplishment of the organization’s
task” (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967, p. 4) and includes both the cooperation and
coordination of interests and actions (Gulati et al., 2005).

In organization science, the tension between differentiation and integration
has been well accepted and studied (Gulati et al., 2005; O’Reilly & Tushman,
2008; Raisch & Birkinshaw, 2008). Although some of the extant literature views
differentiation and integration as a tradeoff (Boisot, Grifﬁths, & Mole, 1997), more
recently, scholars focus on Lawrence and Lorsch’s core premise that ﬁrms jointly
pursuing differentiation and integration may achieve more successful outcomes.
For example, ﬁrms that carry out both structural differentiation and speciﬁc integra-
tion mechanisms may be more successful in corporate venturing efforts (Burgers,
Jansen, Van Den Bosch, & Volberda, 2009). Furthermore, internal integration
mechanisms can mediate the relationship between structural differentiation and
the ability to pursue explorative and exploitative innovation (Jansen, Tempelaar,
Van Den Bosch, & Volberda, 2009). In a manufacturing environment, ﬁrms may
be better positioned to achieve higher performance outcomes by pursuing both
integration and differentiation through joint SCI and MBMP activities.

As described above, a large body of literature establishes SCI as consistent
with Lawrence and Lorsch’s (1967) deﬁnition of integration. Differentiation can be
represented by the modularization of manufacturing systems. For example, Ulrich
(1995, p. 422) distinguishes a modular architecture as “a one-to-one mapping
from functional elements in the function structure to the physical components of
the product, and speciﬁes de-coupled interfaces between components.” Support
for modularity as providing differentiation is provided by Baldwin and Clark’s
(1997, p. 149) deﬁnition of modularity as “building a complex product or process
from smaller subsystems that can be designed independently yet function together
as a whole.”

Thus, MBMP as a differentiation strategy enables ﬁrms to distinctively con-
ﬁgure their resources and increase independence of subsystems within a complex
system (Brusoni & Prencipe, 2001a, 2001b; Brusoni, Prencipe, & Pavitt, 2001;
Langlois, 2002; Cohen & Roussel, 2005). We follow Tu et al. (2004, p. 148) in
deﬁning MBMP as “a set of actions that enable ﬁrms to achieve modularity in
product design, production process design, and organizational design.” MBMP
has three components: dynamic teaming, process modularity, and product modu-
larity. Dynamic teaming refers to team-building processes, and captures the degree
to which production teams are organized and united to respond to changes in
processes and products. Process modularity is the “practice of standardizing man-
ufacturing process modules so that they can be re-sequenced easily or new modules
can be added quickly in response to changing product requirements” (Tu et al.,


Terjesen, Patel, and Sanders

2004, p. 148) and can help internal operations functions respond more rapidly
to changing environmental demands by easily adding, removing, and rearranging
processes (Van Hoek & Weken, 1998). Product modularity refers to the use of
standardized product modules to facilitate rearrangement into different functional
forms to deploy new product lines.

A growing body of modularity research (Pil & Cohen, 2006; Campagnolo
& Camuffo, 2010) describes how modularity enhances ﬂexibility (Langlois &
Richard, 1992; Baldwin & Clark, 2000), enables mass customization (Duray,
Ward, Milligan, & Berry, 2000; Tu et al., 2004), increases alliance performance
(Tiwana, 2008), reduces operating costs (Hoogeweegen, Teunissen, Vervest, &
Wagenaar, 1999), facilitates development of tacit knowledge (Kotabe, Parente,
& Murray, 2007), and leads to higher ﬁnancial performance and sales growth
(Worren, Moore, & Cardona, 2002). However, evidence on modularity’s impact
on performance outcomes is mixed, with some pointing to negative outcomes
(Brusoni et al., 2001; Fleming & Sorenson, 2001; Ernst, 2005).

Achieving superior performance is an important competitive objective of
ﬁrms (Allred, Fawcett, Wallin, & Magnan, 2011). Power’s (2005) literature re-
view describes that a key problem with SCI is that many ﬁrms are unable to fully
achieve its implementation. Scholars highlight the difﬁculty that ﬁrms may expe-
rience when attempting to implement and manage modularity of organizational
routines (Lorenzi & Lello, 2001; Pan, Pan, Chen, & Hsieh, 2007). We outline how
the dual pursuit of SCI and MBMP can lead to better ﬁrm performance outcomes.
We focus our line of arguments on how SCI can be enhanced by MBMP capabil-
ities. Speciﬁcally, MBMP can enhance a ﬁrm’s ability to design loose coupling
between its internal subunits to improve its ﬂexibility to effectively integrate with
supply chain partners. Orton and Weick (1990, p. 205) propose that “the concept of
loose coupling allows theorists to posit that any system, in any organizational loca-
tion, can act on both a technical level, which is closed to outside forces (coupling
produces stability) and an institutional level, which is open to outside forces (loose-
ness produces ﬂexibility). . . If there is responsiveness without distinctiveness, the
system is tightly coupled. If there is distinctiveness without responsiveness, the
system is decoupled. If there is both distinctiveness and responsiveness, the system
is loosely coupled.”

In a manufacturing ﬁrm context, SCI requires integrated system responsive-
ness rather than individual distinctiveness. As a result, SCI demands tight coupling
between individual units. By contrast, loose coupling of organizational units en-
ables each unit to develop distinctive capabilities although coordinating across
supply chain participants. One organization strategy is to maintain tight coupling
with supply chain participants although decoupling internal units to optimize ca-
pabilities development. Firms can increase the effectiveness of complex systems
by dividing a system into distinct interacting yet independent subsystems to sys-
tematically increase system performance. Modularity is typically considered on
a continuum of the degree of interaction among subsystems. Greater modularity
helps implement rapid changes in individual subsystems, thereby reducing the need
for coordinated changes in other subsystems (Schilling, 2000). As a result, man-
aging integration-differentiation duality requires decomposing design variables to
maintain as few interactions as possible across the main subsets. We propose that


8

Managing Differentiation-Integration Duality

MBMP helps ﬁrms to maintain integration although facilitating loose coupling
within manufacturing subsystems. MBMP capabilities enhance ﬁrms’ ability to
achieve the three SCI components of supplier integration, customer integration,
and internal integration.

Supplier integration is characterized by information exchange, strategic part-
nership, and participation in design, procurement, and production. A ﬁrm’s product
architecture strategy shapes its communication channels, problem-solving strate-
gies, and coordinating routines (Henderson & Clark, 1990; Sanchez & Mahoney,
1996; Pil & Cohen, 2006). MBMP is based on the development of common
modular products and processes and thus a shared language is developed inter-
nally and shared externally with suppliers and customers (Schilling, 2000; Garud,
Karaswamy, & Langlois, 2003). This common understanding can enhance com-
munication with suppliers, facilitating the exchange of information and greater
partnership with suppliers at design, procurement, and production phases. Greater
honesty and promises of suppliers are associated with higher information visibility
(Wang & Wei, 2007). Loosely coupled MBMP enables ﬁrms to share components
and maximize ﬂexibility (Tu et al., 2004). Sharing of information leads to dis-
cussions between buyers and suppliers about how best to manage risks and close
interactions during product development (Van Hoek & Weken, 1998). The dynamic
teaming capabilities inherent in MBMP can aid supplier integration through active
participation and quick response, especially to suppliers’ most pressing needs for
information exchange and problem solving.

Customer integration involves feedback mechanisms, computerization of or-
dering, organic linkages, market information sharing, order process agility, and
the frequency and level of communication. As described above, MBMP facili-
tates the development and use of a common language. This shared vocabulary aids
knowledge diffusion, enabling a higher level and frequency of communication with
customers. Furthermore, modularity enables quick reconﬁguration and recombina-
tion that can satisfy “diverse and ﬂuid customer preferences” (Pil & Cohen, 2006,
p. 996). Organizations’ dynamic teaming capabilities are contingent on possessing
accurate information about customers (Tu et al., 2004), and this leads to knowledge
sharing of tasks, tools, and processes through product and process modularity con-
duits. Process modularity hinges on ﬂexible production processes such as process
postponement which involves delaying the customization of subprocesses until
demand is more certain, or placing those subprocesses in distribution centers to
achieve maximum ﬂexibility. These capabilities can enhance customer integration
in terms of the agility of the ordering process.

The third SCI component, internal integration, is characterized by informa-
tion network data, systemwide IT integration, real time search for inventory level
and logistics-related operating data, integration production process data and inven-
tory management, and constructing systemswide interactions. Internal integration
efforts can also be signiﬁcantly enhanced by MBMP. In addition to the external
information conduits described above, MBMP facilitates internal sharing of opera-
tional resources and capabilities. Furthermore, ﬁrms with strong MBMP initiatives
are capable of developing teams that can be reorganized to respond to changes and
reassigned to tasks (Tu et al., 2004). These teams can then be deployed to the most
pressing integration issues.

Thus, taken together, modular architectures enhance internal effectiveness
while managing external effectiveness. Product modularity provides ﬂexibility by
increasing the range of substitutions without requiring changes in the designs of
product components (Garud et al., 2003). Structural design facilitated by MBMP
encourages rapid knowledge exchange across the supply chain and reduces the
response time for exploiting windows of opportunities. Further, product modularity
increases the speed of product launches and helps to quickly recoup costs of
innovation. These capabilities can enhance the systemwide information system
and data integration.

Drawing on the concept of differentiation integration, we suggest that increas-
ing levels of SCI should be coupled with the differentiation promoting strategy of
MBMP to enhance operational performance. This leads to our second hypothesis:

H2: Higher levels of SCI require higher levels of MBMP for enhanced

operational performance.

Impact of Environmental Uncertainty
Lawrence and Lorsch (1967, p. 6) suggest that “subsystems in any organiza-
tion could be expected to develop different degrees of structure in relation to
the certainty of their subenvironment” and ﬁnd that organizations with high sub-
unit differentiation which also maintain high integration among subunits are best
equipped to deal with environmental changes. As argued by Gulati et al. (2005,
p. 417), “differentiated and diverse organizational subunits can recognize and
engage in a wider search for new opportunities when environmental conditions
change. . . Achieving integration between interdependent organizational subunits
is necessary in order to respond effectively to change.”

As outlined earlier, contingency theory stresses the importance for organi-
zations to match their strategies, structure, and processes to their environment
(Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967; Donaldson, 2001) and that this ﬁt is especially critical
in highly uncertain environments. Environmental uncertainty describes the rate
and unpredictability of change in a ﬁrm’s external environment (Dess & Beard,
1984) and refers to a lack of information about future states. As a result, uncer-
tainty requires strategic ﬂexibility and responsiveness on the part of the ﬁrm, while
maintaining integration (Milliken, 1987). As the value of resources changes across
different environments (Priem & Butler, 2001), we expect that the joint exhibition
of SCI and MBMP capabilities has the most positive relationship to operational
performance in environments characterized by high uncertainty. We examine this
with respect to key components of an uncertain environment: lack of information
coupled with high levels of unpredictability and change.

Highly uncertain environments are characterized by a lack of information.
To cope, organizations must develop organic structures, increase teamwork, and
enhance decentralization while simultaneously engaging in boundary spanning
and integration (Thompson, 1967; Orton & Weick, 1990). In these environments,
jointly high levels of SCI and MBMP can enhance information ﬂows, helping to
quickly coordinate resources and actions across participating units. Prior research
suggests that the confusion and lack of understanding about a phenomenon mod-
erate the relationship between internal and external integration and performance


10

Managing Differentiation-Integration Duality

(Koufteros et al., 2005). Modularity practices can eliminate some of this confusion
as they entail a shared language internally and externally (Schilling, 2000; Garud
et al., 2003) and facilitate information exchange.

In highly uncertain environments, change “is hard to predict and that height-
ens uncertainty for key organizational members” (Dess & Beard, 1984, p. 56).
In particular, there may be a high degree of uncertainty regarding customer pref-
erences, competitor actions, and supplier capabilities. MBMP capabilities can
enhance SCI. For example, research suggests that when customer preferences are
complex and unknown, ﬁrms modularize their products in unique ways (Pil &
Cohen, 2006). Furthermore, through speed and ﬂexibility of response, MBMP can
help ﬁrms respond to uncertainty by shortening product development time and
lowering costs (Sanchez & Mahoney, 1996). These efforts may be further aided
by unifying IT systems.

Taken together, contingency theory suggests ﬁrms that maintain high integra-
tion among subunits while achieving high levels of subunit differentiation are best
equipped to adapt to environmental changes (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967; Tushman
& Nadler, 1978; Hambrick, 1983; Kotha & Nair, 1995). This leads to our third
hypothesis:

H3: Higher levels of environmental uncertainty require higher levels of con-
gruence between SCI and MBMP to achieve operational performance.

METHODOLOGY AND DATA

Sample
The sample is comprised of private one-plant manufacturing ﬁrms from the Dun
and Bradstreet Million Dollar Database that met the following criteria: (i) more
than $5 million in sales revenues in 2009, (ii) located in ﬁve Midwest states (IL,
IN, KY, OH, and MO), and (iii) SIC codes 20–39. We chose the criterion of $5
million in sales revenues as larger ﬁrms are more likely to have undertaken SCI
and MBMP initiatives. We assessed the representativeness of our sample against
the entire population of private manufacturing ﬁrms listed in the database in 2009,
yielding a sampling error of 6.91% which is within recommended limits (S¨arndal,
Swensson, & Wretman, 2003). We randomly selected 60 ﬁrms for each of the fol-
lowing 18 2-digit SIC codes to ensure a cross-section of manufacturing: food and
kindred products (20), textile mill products (20), apparel and other ﬁnished prod-
ucts (23), lumber and wood products, except furniture (24), furniture and ﬁxtures
(25), paper and allied products (26), printing, publishing, and allied industries
(27), chemicals and allied products (28), petroleum reﬁning and related indus-
tries (29), rubber and miscellaneous plastics products (30), stone, clay, glass, and
concrete products (32), primary metal industries (33), fabricated metal products,
except machines (34), industrial and commercial machinery (35), electronic and
other electrical equipment (36), transportation equipment (37), measuring, analyz-
ing, and controlling instruments (38), and miscellaneous manufacturing industries
(39).

Pilot Study
We developed the survey instrument using items shown to be reliable in leading
studies. The survey was ﬁrst piloted on three operations management researchers
using Q-sorting. The interrater agreement on sorting was 96%, 95%, and 94% for
SCI, MBMP, and operational performance, respectively. We then sought feedback
from three other operations management researchers on survey format, order of
survey items, and survey wording. Based on their feedback and survey design
guidelines for limiting common method variance by Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee,
and Podsakoff (2003), we incorporated clear guidelines for the survey, provided
a glossary of items at the end of the survey, incorporated different scale types,
changed the order of scale items, and provided clearer question stems. We then
piloted the survey on four operations managers. Based on their feedback, we
included clear guidelines in the survey invitation letter and a glossary of terms at
the end of the survey.

Survey
In December 2009, the survey was sent to operations managers and CEOs as both
are familiar with manufacturing routines and processes in private ﬁrms (Sharfman,
1998). We included a cover letter and a prepaid business reply envelope. To enhance
typically low response rates, we informed the respondents that if they completed
the survey, we would donate $10 to a charity of their choice. The initial mailing
was followed by three reminder e-mails between January 2010 and March 2010.
We received 307 surveys. Our 28.4% response rate is very favorable compared
to typical rates of 10–20% in studies of mailed surveys to top executives (e.g.,
Swink et al., 2007). Our ﬁnal sample is 261 ﬁrms as we excluded 32 ﬁrms with
incomplete data and 14 ﬁrms with more than one manufacturing plant.

We assessed the differences among early and late respondents. There were no
signiﬁcant differences among early and late respondents on dimensions of ﬁrm age
(F = 0.39, not signiﬁcant [n.s.]), sales revenue in 2009 (F = 0.43, n.s.), number of
employees (F = 1.06, n.s.), SIC code (F = 0.87, n.s.), and respondent’s industry
work experience (F = 0.91, n.s.).

Further, we tested for nonresponse bias by examining the mean responses
of respondents and nonrespondents in terms of ﬁrm demographics. No signiﬁcant
differences were found for age (F = 1.08, n.s.), sales revenue in 2009 (F =
0.84, n.s.), number of employees (F = 1.52, n.s.), SIC code (F = 1.21, n.s.), and
respondent’s industry work experience (F = 1.27, n.s.). We therefore concluded
that nonresponse bias was not a threat to validity. We calculated sampling error in
the context of the population of manufacturing ﬁrms in 2009 in the ﬁve Midwest
states. Our sampling error of 4.82% is within acceptable range (S¨arndal et al.,
2003), suggesting that our sample was representative of manufacturing ﬁrms.

Measures
Our survey included multi-item measures for each construct. We also conducted
construct validity and discriminant validity tests on each variable (Appendix). In
addition to Cronbach’s alpha, we employed two other measures of internal con-
sistency: Raykov’s rho (ρ) and the ordinal reliability alpha. Raykov’s rho corrects


12

Managing Differentiation-Integration Duality

for the underestimation of scale reliability (Raykov, 1998). As the predictors and
the outcome measure are based on noncontinuous Likert-type scales, we used the
ordinal reliability alpha (Zumbo, Gadermann, & Zeisser, 2007). Table A1 presents
individual item loadings, conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) at scale and sub-
construct levels, multiple measures of internal constancy (i.e., Cronbach’s alpha,
Raykov’s rho, ordinal reliability alpha), and average variance extracted (AVE).
Table A2 shows tests for alternate speciﬁcations of the measurement model. As
SCI and MBMP are multiitem measures with subdimensions, the validity of the
second-order factor is presented in Table A3.

Dependent variable: Operational performance
We used Wong et al.’s (2011) 17-item measure of operational performance with
four dimensions: delivery [5 items], production cost [4 items], product quality
[4 items], and production ﬂexibility [4 items]. The measure showed acceptable
internal consistency (α = 0.838), convergent validity (χ 2 = 179.387, df = 112; CFI
= 0.97; TLI = 0.96; RMSEA = 0.038; SRMR = 0.025), and discriminant validity
(AVE = 0.682). This measure is consistent with Sousa and Voss’ (2008) advice
that operations management (OM) contingency research should focus on multiple
operational performance aspects. Furthermore, we use the same measures of SCI
and operational performance as Wong et al. (2011) note that prior studies’ use of
vastly different measures prevented meaningful comparisons and conclusions.

Independent variables: SCI
SCI is measured with a three-dimensional 21-item scale from Narasimhan and Kim
(2002): supplier integration [6 items], internal integration [8 items], and customer
integration [7 items]. The measure showed acceptable internal consistency (α
= 0.822), convergent validity (χ 2 = 227.036, df = 182; CFI = 0.94; TLI =
0.93; RMSEA = .042; SRMR = .016), and discriminant validity (AVE = 0.636).
Recent research highlighted the need to consider all three dimensions of SCI (Flynn
et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2011). The internal integration items capture IT-related
concepts such as data integration, systemwide information systems integration,
and real time searching. The customer integration item includes computerization
of customer ordering. The supplier integration item includes information exchange
with suppliers through IT.

MBMP
MBMP is a three-dimensional 15-item scale from Tu et al. (2004): dynamic teaming
[5 items], process modularity [5 items], and product modularity [5 items]. MBMP
has high internal consistency (α = 0.823), convergent validity (χ 2 = 129.328, df
= 83; CFI = 0.96; TLI = 0.95; RMSEA = .048; SRMR = .02), and discriminant
validity (AVE= 0.622). This multidimensional perspective on modularity (product,
process, and organization) was called for in a recent literature review (Campagnolo
& Camuffo, 2010).

Environmental uncertainty
Environmental uncertainty is based on Dess and Beard (1984). We compiled
data from COMPUSTAT on industry (4-digit SIC code) net sales and operating
income from 2005 to 2009. Following Keats and Hitt (1988), we conducted two
regressions: natural logarithm of industry sales on time, and natural logarithm of
operating income on time. Environmental uncertainty is the average of the antilog
of the standard error of beta in each regression. Higher standard errors indicate
increased discontinuities in the environment, and therefore greater environmental
uncertainty.

Control variables
We included several control variables that offer alternative explanations of per-
formance. First, we controlled for ﬁrm characteristics including ﬁrm size (natural
logarithm of number of employees) and ﬁrm age. Based on the two regressions
to operationalize environmental uncertainty, we calculated environmental munif-
icence as the antilog of regression coefﬁcients of the natural log of industry net
sales on time and the natural log of operating income on time. Environmental com-
plexity, based on 4-digit SIC codes in COMPUSTAT, is the regression coefﬁcient
of terminal year market shares of all ﬁrms (ﬁrms’ market shares in 2009) on their
shares in the initial year (ﬁrms’ market share in 2005). The regression coefﬁcient is
obtained as β = (cid:2)
, where xi and yi are deviations from the mean market share.
We follow Heeley, King, and Covin (2006) in multiplying the computed measure
of environmental complexity by –1 to ensure that more complex environments are
designated by larger numbers.

We classiﬁed ﬁrms into ﬁve distinct manufacturing processes based on 4-digit
SIC codes: highly standardized continuous ﬂow manufacturing, high-volume mass
production, mid-volume assembly line, mid-volume disconnected line and batch
production, or specialized, low-volume job shops (reference category; Bharadwaj,
Bharadwaj, & Bendoly, 2007).

Means, standard deviations, and correlations are presented in Table 1.

Common Method Bias
The survey’s single respondent nature may be susceptible to common method
bias. We took steps to mitigate this during the survey design phase and conducted
several tests to assess the threat. First, as described earlier, we incorporated survey
design guidelines from Podsakoff et al. (2003). Second, we used Harman’s one-
factor test to assess common method bias. We extracted ﬁve factors accounting for
83.62% of variance. The ﬁrst factor accounted for 17.84% of variance, indicating
there is lower likelihood of common method variance problem. Third, based on
recent recommendation by Podsakoff et al. (2003), we included a method factor
in the measurement model to explain relative variance explained by substantive
factors and the method factor. The substantive constructs explained 94.25% of
the variance. The method factor explained 1.17% of the variance, indicating that
common method bias was not a signiﬁcant threat to the validity of ﬁndings.

Construct Validity
Using principal components analysis with varimax rotation, we assessed the factor
structure of the overall model. Items loaded into respective factors as proposed
in the theoretical model, generating acceptable Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of
sampling adequacy (0.936; recommended value closer to 1) and Bartlett’s test of
sphericity (χ 2/df = 11.482; p < .001). Bartlett’s tests the null hypothesis that
the correlation matrix is an identity matrix. An identity matrix includes all of the
nondiagonal elements at 0 and all of the diagonal elements at 1. An acceptable factor
structure rejects this null hypothesis. The initial assessment suggests satisfactory
factor loadings to further assess convergent validity.

Convergent validity was assessed using item loadings and their t-values.
Greater factor loadings provide stronger evidence for a relationship among the
observed indicators and their respective latent factors. For discriminant validity
we used AVE. Based on the cutoffs suggested in Bagozzi, Yi, and Singh (1991),
our measures have adequate convergent and discriminant validity (Appendix, Table
A1). Furthermore, before aggregating measures, we tested the validity of second-
order factors (SCI, MBMP, and operational performance; Table A2).

DISCUSSION OF HYPOTHESES RESULTS

SCI and Operational Performance
Hypothesis 1 proposes an inverse U-shaped relationship between SCI and oper-
ational performance, testing the assumption of a universally positive relationship
between the two variables. As shown in Table 2, H1 is supported (β = −.027, p <
.01). Although not hypothesized, drawing on differentiation integration, excessive
modularity-based manufacturing could also have an inverse U-shaped relationship
to operational performance. As shown in Table 2, we ﬁnd this to be the case (β =
−.026, p < .05). The ﬁndings suggest that separately both SCI and MBMP have
an inverse U relationship with operational performance.

To ensure a correct interpretation of the results, we tested the extent to which
the inverse U relationship is valid in the context of the current data. Most studies
of inverse U hypotheses are tested using signiﬁcance levels for the squared term
of the variable of interest. If the p-value of the squared term is negative and sig-
niﬁcant, the variables are considered to have an inverse U relationship. Following
recommendations by Blanchﬂower (2007) and Lind and Mehlum (2010), addi-
tional tests are necessary. We proceeded with a series of tests. First, we tested the
joint signiﬁcance of direct and squared terms of SCI and MBMP. We then relied
on Sasabuchi’s (1980) test for the inverse U shape of SCI to explore the joint null
hypotheses: (i) effect of SCI on operational performance is not increasing at low
values of SCI, and (ii) effect of SCI on operational performance is not decreasing at
high values of SCI. We also used Sasabuchi’s (1980) test to examine the effects of
MBMP on operational performance. Next, we estimated the extreme point of the
effect of SCI and MBMP and calculated conﬁdence intervals based on the Fieller
standard error and Delta method (Lind & Mehlum, 2010). Table 3 shows the results
of the tests. The inverse U relationship is signiﬁcant. The conﬁdence intervals for
both the Fieller and Delta methods indicate that SCI and MBMP values are within
the limits of the data.

SCI, MBMP, and Operational Performance
Hypothesis 2 proposes that SCI coupled with MBMP enhances operational per-
formance. This hypothesis was tested using polynomial regression as it provides
distinct advantages over other forms of contingency testing approaches such as
interaction or deviance scores (Edwards, 2001).

The bivariate ﬁt between SCI and MBMP is speciﬁed as:
Y = β0 + β1 × A + β2 × B + βx × C + β3 × A2 + β4 × (A × B)
+β5 × B2 + β6 × (A × C) + β7 × (B × C) + β8 × (A2 × C)
+β9 × (A × B × C) + β10 × (B2 × C) + ε,

where A is SCI, B represents MBMP, and C denotes environmental uncertainty.

Polynomial regression is a stepwise model. First, linear effects are introduced.
If the direct effects are signiﬁcant, nonlinear effects are introduced in the next step.
In the context of H2, the line of ﬁt is indicated by (X = Y), and line of misﬁt is (X
= –Y). If increasing both SCI and MBMP enhances operational performance, then
the slope along the ﬁt line (X = Y) should be positive and the slope along the misﬁt
line (X = –Y) should be negative. Table 4(a) shows that the slope is positive along
the ﬁt line (β = 0.277, p < .05), and negative along the misﬁt line (β = −.049,
p < .05). The curvature along the ﬁt line is insigniﬁcant (β = .029, p > 0.10),
thereby indicating linearly increasing returns at higher levels of SCI and MBMP.
Therefore, there is no excessive level of both MBMP and SCI that would lead to
performance declines. Overall, H2 is supported.

Fit to Uncertain Environments
Hypothesis 3 proposes that with higher levels of environmental uncertainty a higher
degree of congruence is needed between SCI and MBMP. Speciﬁcally, at higher
levels of uncertainty, a higher degree of ﬁt is needed between the two variables
to achieve an increase in operational performance compared to lower levels of
uncertainty. The lower portion of Table 4(a) shows that the interaction term with
the ﬁt line is signiﬁcant for environmental uncertainty (slope of ﬁt line: β = .095,
p < .05; curvature of ﬁt line: β = 0.145, p < .05). Therefore, there is strong
support for contingency theory as the returns from increased ﬁt at higher levels
of uncertainty show nonlinearly increasing returns. Furthermore, we examined the
misﬁt line, and found that the effects are insigniﬁcant for linear [slope (β1 + β2):
.023, p > 0.10] and nonlinear effects [curvature (β3 + β4 + β5): −.019, p > 0.10],
therefore substituting SCI for MBMP does not lead to increased performance.
To test if the surfaces are statistically different at different levels of environmen-
tal uncertainty, we split the sample at the median level of environmental uncer-
tainty and tested differences in betas using 500 bootstrap samples in Table 4(b).
There are signiﬁcant differences in estimates, indicating that varying levels of

Managing Differentiation-Integration Duality

environmental uncertainty impact ﬁt. Overall, structural model ﬁndings support
all three hypotheses.

Post hoc Analysis
Because of our relatively smaller sample size, we draw on Cohen, Cohen, West,
and Aiken (2003) to identify the required sample size for each model. Table 2 lists
sample sizes required for each model at power levels of 0.95. Next, based on Efron
and Tibshirani (1997), we calculate overall model power using a bootstrapping
approach drawing 1,000 replications. The model’s power of 0.86 is found to be
well above the statistically prescribed levels (Cohen et al., 2003).

It is likely that gains from MBMP and SCI are contingent on ﬁrm size. To
ensure that our results are consistent under different ﬁrm sizes, we split the sample
into three employee groups: 50 or less, 51–100, and more than 100. We ﬁnd that
the effects of MBMP and SCI are greater for larger ﬁrms than for smaller ﬁrms.
However, the direction, magnitude, and statistical signiﬁcance of the proposed
relationships do not change for any of the subgroups.

Finally, in addition to polynomial regression, we use ANCOVA to test differ-
ences in effects. We split the sample of ﬁrms based on high and low levels of SCI,
MBMP, and environmental uncertainty. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences between
low SCI, low MBMP and high SCI, and high MBMP (F-test = 7.324, p < .001).
Next, we compare high uncertainty [low SCI: low MBMP] versus low uncertainty
[high SCI: high MBMP], again identifying signiﬁcant differences (F-test= 12.828,
p < .001). Taken together, our post hoc analyses support all three hypotheses.

IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY AND PRACTICE

Our study makes several important contributions to the literature on SCI and
MBMP. First, prior studies ﬁnd mixed results with respect to SCI and performance.
These results have been attributed to a lack of consideration of the environment,
unclear deﬁnitions, and inconsistent operationalizations (Fabbe-Costes & Jahre,
2008). We use the three-component SCI construct (supplier, customer, and internal
integration) called for in recent studies (Flynn et al., 2010) to inform prior research
and guide future research. Using a stratiﬁed sample across 18 manufacturing
industry categories and measures found to be reliable in leading studies, we ﬁnd
that the relationship between SCI and operational performance is an inverse U. This
suggests that there are costs to a high degree of internal and external integration.
Similarly, we identify an inverse U relationship between MBMP and oper-
ational performance, suggesting that high levels of differentiation resulting from
modularity are also costly. This is supported by prior studies that suggest modular
capability may lead to poor performance outcomes (Brusoni et al., 2001; Fleming
& Sorenson, 2001; Ernst, 2005). We conﬁrm this, but only at extremely high levels
of modularity and without the presence of integration. Moreover, a unique contri-
bution of this study is that MBMP can enhance the effects of SCI on operational
performance. The joint contribution of high levels of both SCI and MBMP to
operational performance is especially important in environments characterized by
high uncertainty.


Terjesen, Patel, and Sanders

Further, our study makes important contributions toward a deeper under-
standing of the differentiation-integration duality. Within the operations context,
we present the case of modularity as a differentiation strategy and SCI as an
integration strategy to show that the two can work in tandem to create organiza-
tional synergies. Although the operations literature has recently recognized the
importance of ambidexterity, or the balance of exploration and exploitation based
innovation efforts (Adler et al., 2009; Kristal, Huang, & Roth, 2010), we show
that ﬁrms also gain from balancing differentiation and integration. Organizational
science has provided support for the notion of ambidexterity, with the expectation
that such organizations achieve superior performance (Raisch, Birkinshaw, Probst,
& Tushman, 2009). We provide further support for this organizational strategy
within operations and supply chain environments.

With respect to contingency theory, we answer Sousa and Voss’ (2008) call
to develop more sophisticated theorizing and tests in operations management.
We return to one of the seminal contributions to contingency theory (Lawrence
& Lorsch, 1967) and explicitly explore the critical importance of pursuing both
differentiation and integration. Furthermore, we add to the large body of research
on SCI, operational performance, and environmental uncertainty (e.g., Koufteros
et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2011) by examining the interrelationship of MBMP.

This study also suggests a number of important managerial implications.
Today’s manufacturing ﬁrm managers face an increasingly turbulent environment
characterized by short product life cycles, global competition, regulatory policies,
and new technologies, as well as changes in consumer conﬁdence and spending
(KPMG/EIU, 2010) and pressures to cut costs (Bates, Flynn, & Flynn, 2009). Our
research indicates that even in these uncertain times, managers should continue
to develop and leverage SCI and MBMP capabilities. Existing research has iden-
tiﬁed that ﬁrms have difﬁculty implementing SCI (Power, 2005) and modularity
(Lorenzi & Lello, 2001; Pan et al., 2007). Indeed, there is great heterogeneity in
the use of SCI (Power, 2005) and modular design practices (Pil & Cohen, 2006).
Implementation is critical to achieving success with SCI (Power, 2005) and modu-
larity (Pan et al., 2007). Our ﬁndings suggest that MBMP activities may help with
SCI implementation. That is, although strategic integration and modular manufac-
turing processes require organizational resources, their efforts may complement
one another. The message for managers is that the integration of response offered
by SCI may not be sufﬁcient to provide ﬂexibility and responsiveness, and should
be coupled with a strategy that provides differentiation. The contingency theory
perspective is especially critical as it provides guidelines for especially turbulent
task environments.

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

The implications discussed should be considered in light of several limitations
of this study, which warrant further investigation. First, the cross-sectional nature
of the data makes it difﬁcult to empirically test causality. Future research should
incorporate longitudinal data to evaluate the dynamic relationship of the variables
studied. Second, our performance measures are based on perceptions. Although a
recent literature review of 38 SCI-performance articles reported that all the studies


22

Managing Differentiation-Integration Duality

used senior managers’ perceptions of performance (Fabbe-Costes & Jahre, 2008),
triangulation with secondary data sources is desirable. Third, our measure of inter-
nal integration does not include several potentially important subsystem interfaces
such as manufacturing–marketing and manufacturing–research and development.
Future studies of subsystem interfaces within and outside the ﬁrm could provide
a more systemic understanding of differentiation-integration duality. Fourth, it
would also be desirable to have dyadic or triadic data from buyers and suppliers
regarding the extent of integration.

In addition to the suggestions stemming from the limitations of our research,
we offer three promising directions for future research. First, there may be cer-
tain ﬁrm capabilities that enable SCI and MBMP. For example, Wu, Melnyk, and
Flynn (2010) recently identiﬁed six emergent operational capabilities: operational
improvement, innovation, customization, cooperation, responsiveness, and recon-
ﬁguration. Other potential drivers are ﬁrm capabilities of organizational learning
(e.g., absorptive capacity) and innovation (e.g., ambidexterity). Further research
could investigate how these capabilities impact SCI and MBMP implementation,
especially in uncertain environments.

Second, researchers could explore other possible contingency factors. Al-
though this study focuses on SCI, MBMP, and environmental uncertainty, there
are likely additional factors related to internal operations (e.g., ﬁrm structure, cul-
ture, size) or external environments (e.g., technological diffusion). For example,
compared to the large ﬁrms examined in this study, small ﬁrms may be more able to
adapt quickly and therefore may not require MBMP capabilities to the same extent.
As the number of suppliers can impact the supply chain and too much ﬂexibility
can beneﬁt low-price suppliers (Chung et al., 2010), future researchers may wish
to investigate the patterns of supply chain partnerships. Furthermore, supply chain
executives’ decisions regarding SCI initiatives are based on their perceptions of
risk (Villena, Gomez-Mejia, & Revilla, 2009). Future research could explore how
individual perceptions impact joint SCI and MBMP decisions.

Third, there may be an important global component as SCI frequently in-
volves global partners (Qi, Boyer, & Zhao, 2009) and modularization is increas-
ingly part of a global supply chain (Kotabe et al., 2007). Given the trend of
offshoring (Palvia, King, Xia, & Palvia, 2010), future enquiry could investigate
these ﬁrm capabilities in an international context. National contexts and culture
constitute a critical contingency variable (Sousa & Voss, 2008) and there is sig-
niﬁcant cross-country variance in manufacturing plant capabilities (Bates et al.,
2009). Further enquiry could explore whether ﬁrms’ SCI and modularization ca-
pabilities vary when operating in foreign markets, and the impact on operational
performance and other outcomes.

CONCLUSION

The purpose of this research is to investigate how ﬁrms’ SCI strategies can be
enhanced by MBMP, especially in environments characterized by high uncertainty.
Drawing on the concept of differentiation-integration duality, we develop and test
a model on 261 manufacturing ﬁrms. We ﬁnd that both SCI and MBMP have an
inverse U relationship with operational performance, and that increasing levels of

both SCI and MBMP together leads to enhanced operational performance. Further,
this effect is strengthened with high levels of environmental uncertainty.
