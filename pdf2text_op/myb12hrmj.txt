This study investigates the relationship between overall employee turnover and operational performance
and whether organisational culture is a moderator. Using a sample of 114 outpatient centres from a
health-care system, we found a strong negative relationship between employee turnover and operational
performance. Additionally, we found that organisations with a relatively stronger group-oriented
organisational culture did not experience lower operational performance in the presence of high turnover.
These ﬁndings contribute to the literature on the relationship between turnover and performance.
Organisations with persistent high levels of turnover may want to consider developing and adopting
practices that are consistent with a group-oriented organisational culture.

INTRODUCTION

Asubstantial body of organisational literature is concerned with employee turnover (Hom

and Griffeth, 1995; Maertz and Campion, 1998; Griffeth et al., 2000; Griffeth and Hom,
2003; Glebbeek and Bax, 2004; Barrick and Zimmerman, 2005; Holton et al., 2005). Much
of this literature focuses on the causes of employee-initiated turnover with considerable
attention paid to such factors as employee satisfaction,
intention to leave, organisational
commitment and job alternatives. These and other factors have been included in various
theoretical models, such as the intermediate linkage model (Mobley, 1977), the unfolding model
of turnover focusing on process (Lee and Mitchell, 1994), and the process-content integration
model (Maertz and Campion, 2004), to explain why employees leave organisations.

However, while the causes of turnover have been investigated in considerable depth, there
is a smaller but growing body of research devoted to its consequences (Shaw et al., 2005; Meier
and Hicklin, 2008; Ton and Huckman, 2008). These efforts have documented direct costs of
turnover, such as recruiting and training new employees, and these costs appear to be
considerable (Cascio, 1987; Waldman et al., 2004). Studies that have examined turnover as a
predictor variable have found a negative association between turnover rates and various
performance indicators regarding customer service and proﬁtability (Koys, 2001; Shaw et al.,
2005; Kacmar et al., 2006; Hurley and Estelami, 2007).

In this article, we report results from a study that contributes to this developing line of
turnover research in two respects. First, our study investigated the effects of turnover in an
organisational setting characterised by knowledge workers, speciﬁcally, nurses working in
health-care organisations. By knowledge workers, we mean individuals who are involved in the
use of specialised knowledge or skills (Ware and Grantham, 2007). Prior studies have tended
to focus on turnover in organisations that heavily comprise what some researchers refer to as

service workers, such as those in fast food restaurants, hospitality settings and bookstores or
convenience stores (Shaw et al., 2005; Kacmar et al., 2006; Ton and Huckman, 2008; Hausknecht
et al., 2009). Service workers typically provide tangible services or products, have limited
discretion in doing their work and have been trained towards a common approach for handling
all customers. The ﬁndings and applications, however, may not necessarily be generalisable to
knowledge workers as research ﬁndings are sensitive to type of group studied and context
(McGrath, 1986).

In comparison, knowledge workers often deliver intangible services in situations that require
them to personalise or tailor their services to meet the different needs and expectations of their
customers. Moreover, many of the tasks they perform are unstructured and complex and
require collaboration and information sharing with other experts (Roy et al., 2001). As such, the
job tasks of knowledge workers do not follow a ﬁxed decision sequence. Although most
occupations entail some mix of standardised and non-standardised tasks, nurses generally have
tasks that require a considerable degree of decision-making discretion and thus cannot easily
be standardised (Weston, 2008; Jost et al., 2010). The recently legislated Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act will encourage and incentivise health-care organisations to increase the
role of nurses in delivering primary and preventive care and encourages nurses to return to
school to learn these skills (Carlson, 2010), which will also be important in improving care
coordination. Accordingly, while employee turnover is generally assumed to have a negative
effect on organisational performance, we lack a clear understanding of the relationship between
turnover and performance when knowledge workers are involved.

Second, we investigated a theoretically based perspective for the role of group-oriented
organisational culture and the extent to which it moderates the relationship between turnover
and operating performance. To date, little research has considered whether some organisations
may be more or less vulnerable to the potential toxic effects of turnover based on their internal
or external characteristics. By identifying such characteristics, it may become possible for
organisations to develop and adopt speciﬁc strategies that alleviate the harmful effects that
result from employee turnover.

Our investigation draws from and integrates human capital and social capital theories to
the relationship between turnover and

performance for knowledge-based workers. In this vein,
it should be noted that a key
distinction exists between explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge that is relevant to the study
of turnover among knowledge workers (Polanyi, 1996). Explicit knowledge is information that
can be written as part of the rules and policies of an organisation and thus is relatively easy
to transfer from one person to another. By contrast, tacit knowledge consists of the set of
‘mental models’ employees have about the organisation and its procedures. This type of
knowledge typically cannot be transmitted in writing or in classroom training and so is usually
acquired by employees only through work experience at an organisation. Transfer of tacit
knowledge between people can be slow, costly and uncertain (Kogut and Zander, 1992; Grant,
1996). From the perspective of the knowledge-based theory, turnover can cause operational
disruptions during the period of time when replacement employees are trying to acquire the
tacit knowledge needed to perform their jobs.

Turnover and organisational performance

As noted, in considering the relationship between turnover and organisational performance, we
refer to human capital (Kacmar et al., 2006; Hurley and Estelami, 2007) and social capital
theories (Dess and Shaw, 2001; Shaw et al., 2005), both of which have been advanced to explain
why turnover may negatively affect an organisation’s performance. Human capital is the sum

Employee turnover and operational performance

of an individual’s knowledge and skills applicable to the work process for an organisation. It
can be increased through formal training and education as well as in practice as part of work
experiences. Human capital can be task speciﬁc (Gibbons and Waldman, 2004) and can be
attained by acquiring complex cognitive skills through extended deliberate practice (Ericsson
et al., 2007).

While human capital theories focus on the worker’s skills and knowledge developed
formally or informally and tacitly or explicitly as a valuable resource, the social capital
perspective focuses on relationships among individuals as a valuable resource. Social capital is
a network of interpersonal relationships that one can use to beneﬁt himself or herself or an
organisation. Such networks can facilitate the development and application of knowledge.
Greater transfer of knowledge has been found to occur through social networks as a function
of the extent to which an organisation supports formal and informal interactions among
individuals or groups (Sammarra and Biggiero, 2008). Individuals are more willing to share
tacit knowledge with people they trust and with whom they have close social connections
(Hansen, 1999; Uzzi and Lancaster, 2003).

Social capital focuses on the ‘goodwill’ that people develop with one another such that a
favour done for someone today is made in the tacit understanding that the favour will be
returned at a later date (Adler and Kwon, 2002). The extent to which members in the network
are connected allows information to be more easily exchanged. Accordingly, social capital can
beneﬁt organisations by increasing communication efficiency (Leana and Van Buren, 1999).
However, social capital, and the facilitation of information among people, is disrupted when
people leave the social network (Koys, 2001; Kacmar et al., 2006).

From both human capital and social capital perspectives, turnover may be particularly
problematic for organisations with knowledge workers. In these organisations, there is often
a need for some individualisation or customisation of the service to meet customer needs
and requests. The more the organisation must customise services, the more it will rely on
the tacit knowledge of its employees to manage their activities to achieve the desired
customisation (Hansen et al., 1999). New employees will typically lack this knowledge and
as a result will be more prone to mistakes or delays in seeking information (Hausknecht
et al., 2009), which, in turn, will have a detrimental effect on organisational performance. The
challenge of
transferring tacit knowledge is that much greater in organisations with
relatively high turnover as it inevitably takes time for new employees to develop strong
social networks (Day, 1994).

Existing research on teams supports this line of logic regarding turnover and performance.
For example, greater stability in team membership was associated with faster learning of new
skills and procedures (Edmondson, 2003). Teams that experienced greater turnover took longer
to learn new skills and procedures (Edmondson et al., 2003). The longer teams have been
together, the better they appear to be able to match tasks to the most qualiﬁed members based
on accumulated knowledge of the strengths and limitations of each member (Reagans et al.,
2005) and appear to develop their own language and ways of communicating that may enhance
their performance (Weber and Camerer, 2003).

Thus, high turnover can interfere with performance in knowledge-based settings because
new employees lack the requisite tacit knowledge required to perform their jobs effectively and
because it disrupts social network composition in ways that dilute available sources of tacit
knowledge. Our ﬁrst hypothesis is as follows:

Hypothesis 1: In organisations using knowledge workers, the employee turnover rate is
negatively related to operational performance.

food or convenience stores, customers expect consistent

As discussed, turnover can be disruptive. One approach used to manage turnover and potential
negative effects is to standardise the job tasks to reduce the need for tacit knowledge.
Standardisation may emphasise strict adherence to company manuals, policies and procedures,
scripted responses to common customer questions, and greater oversight of work. In settings
such as fast
In
organisations with knowledge workers, however, it is not possible to standardise all the tasks
or anticipate all future work requirements. Customers are more likely to have more complex or
individualised needs and will tend to expect that the workers will draw on that knowledge to
tailor and contextualise services. As standardisation is limited in knowledge-based settings, it is
important that tacit knowledge is readily available. We draw from social capital perspectives to
discuss how a group-oriented culture may foster an environment where individuals have a rich
network of information that allows greater tacit knowledge transfer among employees.

interactions.

It also emphasises giving positive feedback and encouragement

In theory, the moderating effect of a group-oriented organisational culture on turnover is
potentially rooted in the organisational practices and values associated with such a culture. A
group-oriented culture emphasises employee belongingness and participation (Quinn and
Rohrbaugh, 1981).
to
employees about their work (Glaser and Zamanou, 1987). As a result, in this type of culture
employees are more likely to develop close working relationships with one another that fosters
mutual trust, commitment and loyalty (Dani et al., 2006). Such trust and loyalty among
employees, which is a particularly central concept in the social capital perspective, is an
important factor in the transfer of tacit knowledge. Transfer of knowledge generally requires a
high level of trust and security in the workplace. Employees are more willing to share
information when they trust one another (Roberts, 2000). Higher levels of employee trust of the
team were found to be positively related to knowledge transfer (Foos et al., 2006). A stronger
internal social network is associated with greater range of knowledge variety within the team
(Wong, 2008). This will make the information that employees departing the organisation take
with them more evenly distributed among remaining members (Tsoukas, 1996). In a recent
meta-analysis, information sharing was related to higher team performance and cohesion
(Mesmer-Magnus and DeChurch, 2009).

A group-oriented organisational culture also emphasises mentoring, so that new employees
entering an organisation are supported and guided by more experienced co-workers. When a
new employee starts in a new job, the team would want to bring the level of knowledge for
the new hire to a competency level that would be effective for the job role in dealing with
customers and others on the team. If the organisation does not have a culture that emphasises
collaboration and cohesion, the tacit knowledge required for effective job performance will
move relatively slowly in reaching new employees. In a culture that emphasises competition
within work units or emphasises negative consequences, such as being ﬁred based on rankings,
co-workers could be less likely to share job-relevant information. This would cause each
employee to ‘rediscover the wheel’ rather than learning from best practices and may impede
overall performance. Therefore, an organisation emphasising group-oriented organisational
culture should also see greater transfer of tacit knowledge among employees.

While social capital theory discusses the value of networks, it does not address the factors
that may facilitate or impede the accessibility of such networks to employees. A group-oriented
organisational culture should facilitate access to networks allowing for both greater exchanges
of information and knowledge among employees. In this respect, a group-oriented culture
serves as an important component of the social capital of an organisation. To the extent an

organisation fosters trust and interpersonal relationships,
this may facilitate transfer of
knowledge efficiently and effectively and disruptions in operational performance due to
turnover of employees should be minimised. Thus, we propose our second hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2: The strength of an organisation’s group-oriented culture will moderate the
relationship between organisational turnover and operational performance, such that the
negative relationship between turnover and performance decreases as the strength of
group-oriented culture increases.

Figure 1 presents the theoretical model we are testing.

Setting

METHODS

We focused on the turnover of registered nurses providing outpatient care at medical centres
within the Veterans Health Administration, which is the health-care delivery component of the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Registered nurses represent approximately a ﬁfth of the
total workforce. A majority of these nurses work in the outpatient centres as an increasing
number of services and procedures are provided in this setting. We obtained outpatient data
for 114 medical centres.

We selected this organisational setting for two reasons. First, in outpatient centres, the job tasks
of registered nurses largely constitute knowledge-based work. Although nurses do follow orders
prescribed by physicians, nurses have considerable autonomy, self-governance and inﬂuence in
the management of patient care services (Center for Nursing Advocacy, 2006; Jost et al., 2010).
Some of the unique skill sets that nurses provide include coordinating the path of care for patients
with complex medical needs, such as coordination of transfers and discharges from inpatient
settings, and counselling patients in self-care management strategies. Nurses are involved in and
participate in most of the tasks of occupationally distinct team members (Best et al., 2006) and
typically have the best idea of how work is to be conducted and coordinated, making them key
individuals within the social network. Also, in health care it is well recognised that work activities
cannot be completely or even substantially standardised as there always exists uncertainty as to
whether and how patients respond to clinical interventions and education. Accordingly, nurses
have considerable decision-making discretion in their work and have the professional and legal
authority to ensure the care prescribed is in the patient’s best interest (Center for Nursing
Advocacy, 2006). In this particular VA setting, the nursing executive is mandated to be part of the

executive-level decision making along with the physician executive. In addition, for several years
there has been a substantial shortage of registered nurses in the US, which has made nurse
turnover a particularly important policy problem (Rosseter, 2010).

Measures
Performance We assessed performance based on two measures of operational effectiveness: a
customer service measure and appointment waiting time. We selected both of these measures
because they are highly relevant to the performance of an outpatient unit and are also
inﬂuenced directly by the work activities of nurses.

For the customer service measure, we used a standardised measure that focuses on how
effectively services are coordinated. Poor service coordination is associated with duplication of
employee efforts and lost time leading to greater costs, delays in service being provided
(Schoen et al., 2006), critical and timely information not getting to the right people (Gandhi,
2005), and errors in services and products delivery (Moore et al., 2003).

The customer service measure for operational performance was obtained from a VA national
database for 2006 for an outpatient satisfaction survey. The response rate for the survey was 56
per cent (n = 248,850). The average number of responses for each outpatient clinic used in the
study was 1,765 (SD = 825). The survey is based on the NRC Picker ambulatory care survey and
contains ﬁve items. An example item from that scale asks, ‘Did someone tell you when you
would ﬁnd out the results of your test?’ Each of the items refer to customer-oriented services
that would be handled either directly by nurses or indirectly through their supervision and
coordination with other clinical staff members in their unit or other units within the medical
centre. The Cronbach’s alpha value for the scale was 0.81. Before aggregating to the
organisation level, the national reporting office adjusts scale scores to account for the inﬂuence
of patient health status and age – patients of greater age and lower health status generally
require greater utilisation of services. We used the adjusted scores for our analyses.

The waiting time measure was the average length of days between when a patient made a
request for an appointment and the third next available appointment opening, which reﬂects
a more accurate assessment of appointment availability (Murray and Berwick, 2003). Consistent
with previously noted turnover studies, we used waiting time as an objective measure of the
operational performance. In health-care settings, longer waiting times have been found to be
negatively associated with other performance measures including hospitalisation and mortality
(Prentice and Pizer, 2007, 2008) and thus represent an important outcome to study as a measure
of operational performance.

The waiting time measure is sensitive to nurse turnover for at least two reasons. First, although
the actual scheduling of appointments for outpatient care is handled by clerks, the clinic nurses
play an important role in managing the appointment process by helping to estimate the number
of patients that can be seen in a given day and the number of available slots to keep open for
urgent care (Stewart et al., 2004). The estimates the nurses make are likely to improve with
experience as nurses increase their tacit knowledge of local factors that can inﬂuence service
demand (e.g. ﬂu season, increased demand in Southern medical centres during the winter season)
and the time required for delivering services (e.g. new group of interns or residents that need to
be better supported). Second, nurses are also involved with oversight of patient visits to the clinic.
For patients with a more complex medical condition(s), nurses are more likely to contact the
patient to remind him or her to attend the scheduled appointment. During the call, the nurse may
also take note of any new issues or concerns expressed by the patient and relay this information
back to the provider. The reminder call process can lead to lower no-show rates, thereby reducing
the need for rescheduling appointments and lowering the overall waiting time for appointments.

Employee turnover and operational performance

Turnover We obtained 2005 nurse turnover data at the outpatient centre level from an internal
database that has been used in other turnover studies (Mohr et al., 2008). Rather than focus on
either voluntary or involuntary turnover, we selected overall turnover as our study focused on
how service coordination may be disrupted when people leave the organisation. We clariﬁed
with HR that the termination rate for nurses was less than 1 per cent; thus, most of the
employees left voluntarily. This is one of the organisational contextual issues, which means that
research results could vary across settings. Turnover was computed as the number of employee
departures over the last 12 months divided by the average number of annual employees
(full-time equivalent employees). The 12-month time frame is typically used in studies on
turnover (Hurley and Estelami, 2007). We computed a natural log-transformation on turnover
rates as is commonly done in other turnover studies (Hurley and Estelami, 2007). For our
sample, the turnover rate for registered nurses was 10.6 per cent, which is slightly higher than
a recent study that found the rate to be 8.4 per cent for this occupational group in public
hospital settings (PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Health Research Institute, 2007).

Group-oriented culture The culture measure for this study is based on a modiﬁed version of
the Competing Values Framework (CVF) (Quinn and Rohrbaugh, 1981; Cameron and Quinn,
1999). The measure was collected as part of a larger survey in 2006 assessing individual,
workgroup and organisation-wide employee attitudes. The subscale for group-oriented culture
consist of three items: (a) managers in my facility are warm and caring; they seek to develop
employees’ full potential and act as their mentors or guides; (b) The glue that holds my facility together
is loyalty and tradition; commitment to this facility runs high; and (c) my facility emphasises human
resources. High cohesion and morale in the organisation are important. Respondents indicated their
agreement for each item on a ﬁve-point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The
response rate for the 2006 survey was 70 per cent with more than 108,000 employee responses.
The number of respondents at the medical centres ranged from 208 to 2,771 with an average
of 1,040 respondents (SD = 569). Cronbach’s alpha for the scale items was 0.83.
Our measure of group-oriented culture has conceptual and empirical

support as
demonstrated in previous research examining the CVF culture framework (Kalliath et al., 1999).
Although some research suggests that group-oriented culture may be part of a larger
organisational culture construct (Helfrich et al., 2007), other studies have reported results
showing group-oriented culture is independently a strong predictor of HR measures (Mohr
et al., 2008; Gregory et al., 2009; Park and Kim, 2009). For example, one study reported
group-oriented culture was associated with lower voluntary turnover for registered nurses and
physicians (Mohr et al., 2008). Another study using a similar measure of group-oriented culture
found that the measure was associated with higher job satisfaction and lower turnover
intention for nurses in Korea (Park and Kim, 2009). An additional study reported that
group-oriented culture was associated with higher employee satisfaction in US hospitals
(Gregory et al., 2009).

We used responses of all employees who work in the medical centre to measure the culture
variable used in the model. Because we were looking to assess how the culture of the
organisation related to outcomes, we used group-oriented culture ratings from all employees.
The culture of the medical centre will inﬂuence how the whole system works together with
employees in different settings. The majority of employees worked in an outpatient centre.
Additionally, as noted, outpatient nurses are responsible for coordinating the care of the
patients across different areas (e.g. inpatient setting, diagnostic settings) of the medical centre.
The correlation for group-oriented culture for employees in the outpatient centre and the
overall organisation was 0.90.

Context variables Based on prior studies, we adjusted for medical centre characteristics that
are potentially associated with the operational performance (Young et al., 2000; Meterko et al.,
2004). We adjusted for geographic location using four regions of the US (i.e. Northeastern,
Central, Western and Southern). Variables were dummy-coded as 0 or 1 and the Southern group
was the referent. We also controlled for the complexity of the medical centre as greater
complexity potentially presents challenges to operational performance. VA has classiﬁed
medical centres into three major categories based on seven criteria including patient, provider,
medical education and research characteristics (VHA Facility Complexity Workgroup, 2005). We
coded medical centres as being in the ‘most complex’,
‘moderately complex’, and ‘least
complex’ group using dummy-coded values of 0 and 1, with the least complex group being the
referent. Finally, we also controlled for the total number of employees within the medical centre
because a larger workforce could make it harder for employees to transfer knowledge and
coordinate activities among each other.

Data aggregation

Because data on group-oriented organisational culture and customer service were aggregated
from individual responses to the level of the medical centre, we calculated aggregation statistics
(James et al., 1984; Bliese, 2000). We found the within-group agreement statistics rwg(j) for
group-oriented organisational culture to be 0.79 and for customer service to be 0.80, which can
be considered an acceptable value. To further justify aggregation, we calculated the values of
the intra-class correlation coefficients, ICC(1) and ICC(2). We found an ICC(1) value of 0.03 for
organisational culture and a value of 0.02 for customer service, indicating the percentage of
variance that can be attributed to between-organisation differences. For ICC(1), larger values,
such as 0.08 or greater, are generally preferred because larger values indicate that fewer
responses are needed to obtain a reliable estimate of the average level of the measure within
the group. A larger group size will lead to higher ICC(2) values and indicate a reliable estimate
of aggregation (Bliese, 1998). Our study did have a large average number of respondents per
unit of observation. We found the reliability of group means was 0.97 for both measures for
ICC(2), greater than the suggested value of 0.70; thus, results supported data aggregation.

Analysis

We ﬁrst examined bivariate correlations among our study variables. Next, we examined the
lagged effects of overall turnover on customer service and waiting time. This is consistent with
prior research on employee turnover and organisational performance (Anderson et al., 1994;
Kacmar et al., 2006; Hurley and Estelami, 2007). By lagging scores, we were able to reduce any
endogeneity bias that may lead to alternative hypotheses that employee turnover may be due
to customer dissatisfaction with operations or that lower waiting time could create more
demand for future visits.

We conducted a three-step hierarchical regression analysis for each outcome variable. In the
ﬁrst step, we entered only our control variables. In the second step, we entered turnover and
group-oriented organisational culture to test for main effects of each variable. In the third step,
we entered the interaction term between turnover and group-oriented organisational culture.
We centred both turnover rates and group-oriented culture when testing the main effects and
the interaction effects (Aiken and West, 1991). We also created graphical depictions of the
relationships when the interaction term was signiﬁcant.

Although turnover has generally been assumed to have a negative effect on the general
performance of organisations, some theorists have suggested that it may also have functional
beneﬁts (i.e. departure of less productive or less committed employees) within certain limits

Employee turnover and operational performance

(Dalton et al., 1981; Siebert and Zubanov, 2009). Additionally, to assess if some amount of
employee turnover can be functional for achieving better performance, we tested for a curvilinear
effect for the turnover variable relative to both measures of operational performance. Speciﬁcally,
we examined the statistical signiﬁcance of the non-transformed quadratic term for turnover.

RESULTS

We ﬁrst examined the bivariate correlation among predictor and dependent variables of
interest. Turnover was negatively associated with the customer service measure (r = -0.21,
p < 0.05) and positively correlated with waiting time (r = 0.20, p < 0.05). The correlation between
the customer service and waiting times was negative (r = -0.24, p < 0.05). We present the
descriptive statistics and correlation matrix in Table 1.

We present results from the regression analyses for customer service in Table 2. As predicted,
the relationship between turnover and the customer service measure was signiﬁcant and
negative; turnover explained an additional 4 per cent (p < 0.05) of variance and group-oriented
organisational culture explained an additional 3 per cent (p < 0.05) of variance in the second
step. This ﬁnding supported our ﬁrst hypothesis that turnover would be associated with
operational performance. The interaction term was signiﬁcant in the third step of the model and
explained 3 per cent more variance. The total model variance explained was 0.36. The
relationship between turnover and customer service was negative when group-oriented culture
was relatively weak and became non-signiﬁcant as the strength of group-oriented culture
increased. In testing for a curvilinear effect, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship for the
non-transformed quadratic turnover variable (p = 0.13).

To further interpretation, we plotted the interaction between group-oriented organisational
culture and turnover. Figure 2 shows the results for customer service. We used plus and minus
one standard deviation lines in creating the ﬁgures. We performed a simple slope analysis
(Aiken and West, 1991) for each regression line to test if the slope was signiﬁcantly different
from zero. Based on the regression, we used standardised estimates of -0.20 for turnover, 0.28
for organisational culture and 0.17 for the interaction term. In line with Hypothesis 2, we found
that organisations with a high mean score for group-oriented organisational culture did not
experience lower customer service scores when turnover was high, but organisations with a
low mean score for group-oriented organisational culture did experience lower scores.

We present the regression analyses for waiting time in Table 3. In the second step of the
model, turnover explained an additional 3 per cent (p < 0.05) of the variance, but group-
oriented organisational culture was non-signiﬁcant. In the third step, we found the interaction
term explained 2 per cent additional variance but was non-signiﬁcant (p = 0.10). The total
variance explained in the model was 22 per cent. In testing for a curvilinear effect, we did not
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship for the quadratic turnover variable (p = 0.48).

DISCUSSION

This study adds to a small but growing body of research that investigates the impact of
employee turnover on operational performance (Ton and Huckman, 2008; Hausknecht et al.,
2009). The study contributes to the literature by examining how operational performance, as
assessed by customer service perceptions and waiting time, is affected by the turnover of
knowledge workers in a health-care context. The study also makes a unique contribution by
testing the role of a moderator variable, group-oriented organisational culture, as a way to
mitigate the negative effects on performance that may arise from employee turnover.

Our ﬁndings provided partial support for our hypotheses. Speciﬁcally, our study found that
greater employee turnover was associated with lower customer service and higher waiting times.
We also found support for the hypothesis that group-oriented organisational culture moderates
the effect of turnover on customer service. The interaction term did not meet a 0.05 level of
signiﬁcance for the waiting time model, but the direction of the effect was in the hypothesised
direction. As a performance measure, waiting time is likely to be less sensitive to employee
turnover than is customer service. Several operational factors that we were unable to measure
may have inﬂuenced waiting times including patient demand for appointments and hours of
clinic operation. As such, these factors may be important to control for in further research.

Theoretical and practical implications

A key theoretical implication of our study concerns the potential role of certain organisational
characteristics to moderate the turnover–organisational performance relationship. To date, little
theory or research has been devoted to this area of inquiry. The results of our study indicate
the need for more research to identify other characteristics that may potentially moderate the
effects of employee turnover. Through such research, it will be possible to develop more
comprehensive and integrated theoretical models on the turnover and performance
relationship. Based on our ﬁndings and those of Ton and Huckman (2008), a key point of
departure for such models may be whether and to what degree work activities can be
standardised. Standardisation of work activities can greatly facilitate the assimilation of new
employees because the information that these employees need to know to perform their jobs
is codiﬁed. Too much standardisation, when customers expect tailoring and context-driven
services, could lead to lower customer service and performance. For organisations where
opportunities for standardisation are limited, which, in addition to health-care organisations,

Employee turnover and operational performance

includes consulting ﬁrms, pharmaceutical companies, software development companies, and
educational institutions, there exists the challenge of transferring tacit knowledge to new
employees in an efficient and effective manner.

Our ﬁndings may be particularly relevant for organisations that deliver services with high
levels of customisation. If service customisation is an important contextual factor, success may
depend on the ability of the organisation to implement HR practices (e.g. performance
management and rewards systems)
that do not encourage internal competition among
employees (i.e. ‘rank-and-yank’). For example, a reward system that encourages a high degree
of competition among employees may impede transfer of tacit knowledge if employees are
looking to maintain a competitive advantage over their co-workers.

Our study offers practical

implications for managers confronted with high employee
turnover. Indeed, shortages of skilled workers are not strictly a ‘health-care-only’ problem as
there are other growing shortages of skilled knowledge workers in other sectors of the
economy. Certainly, managers may not be able to stop all employee departures, but they may
be able to control or neutralise the negative effects of such departures. As noted, how a
manager controls the negative effects of turnover may depend on the extent to which tasks can
be standardised. Research suggests that standardisation of tasks may be an effective moderator
of the turnover and performance relationship (Ton and Huckman, 2008). In organisations
relying on knowledge workers, however, where the potential to standardise tasks is limited, the
development and adoption of techniques for implementing a group-oriented culture may be a
more effective way to manage the impact of employee turnover. Most organisations have jobs
that entail a mix of standardised and non-standardised tasks. Where this is the case, it may be
most productive for an organisation to balance efforts to standardise tasks with efforts to
strengthen group-oriented organisational culture rather than focusing exclusively on either
activity. Finding the right balance may depend on the context and tasks inherent in the
organisation and its activities.

The extant literature points to a number of approaches for developing, adopting and
maintaining a group-oriented organisational culture. For example,
the introduction of a
participative empowerment process, using a group-oriented approach to work structure,
allowing greater employee autonomy, and holding weekly quality improvement meetings were
practices associated with more satisfaction and a stronger culture (Morley and Heraty, 1995).
An approach for building social and/or human capital entails pairing new employees or
junior staff with more senior members as part of the employee orientation process or mentoring
process. Job rotation is another way that employees can develop new knowledge and skills,
both tacit and explicit, by being exposed to a wider range of job duties and a wider range of
individuals in the organisation (Campion et al., 1994).

Although the results of our study suggest that group-oriented culture can mitigate the toxic
effects of turnover on performance, organisations certainly have strong incentives to minimise
employee turnover. Although, we did not observe a signiﬁcant correlation between group-
oriented culture and turnover among nurses (see Table 1), other studies have suggested that
organisational culture can minimise the turnover of nurses, speciﬁcally voluntary turnover and
intention to leave (Mohr et al., 2008; Park and Kim, 2009). Innovation has also been suggested
as an important workplace factor that can minimise turnover among nurses (Cohen et al., 2009).
One study found a positive association between employee ratings of their opportunities for
learning and their intentions to remain with their organisation (Ng and Butts, 2009).
Organisational efforts to increase group-oriented culture, innovation and learning opportunities
may be a particularly salient characteristic that inﬂuences voluntary turnover decisions among
knowledge workers.

Future research considerations

In this vein, group-oriented culture may be one of several moderators that researchers should
examine to understand when employee turnover is most likely to be harmful to performance.
One potential moderator may be new employee socialisation or orientation programmes. By
having a new employee work closely with or shadow a senior employee, it may lead to greater
rates and amounts of tacit knowledge transfer, which could help contain any operational
disruption resulting from employee turnover. In one study, the interaction between the
percentage of new employees and turnover rates was a moderating factor for customer service
ratings (Hausknecht et al., 2009). This ﬁnding may suggest that providing training to new
employees may be an effective way to reduce disruptions in service operations caused by
turnover.

Organisational commitment may also be an important moderator. Committed employees
may be more willing to and capable of transferring tacit knowledge to new employees as part
of stewardship. This may be particularly important for knowledge workers because they may
exhibit stronger organisational commitment (Cohen and Hudececk, 1993). Organisational
commitment was noted as a potential moderator between the extent of tacit knowledge sharing
and organisational justice (Lin, 2007).

Another area for theoretical investigation is organisations that are not experiencing turnover
but are seeing high rates of growth and adding new employees, such as a small business or
start-up organisation expanding to a higher growth and volume company (Kazanjian, 1988). If
an organisation is able to develop a culture that emphasises teamwork and cohesion, this may
allow the new employees to both learn the relevant skills and help the organisation be
successful.

Limitations

Our study has several important limitations. First, the study employs a particular class of
knowledge workers (nurses) in a single setting (outpatient services) to assess the effects of
turnover. Second, we used models of human capital and social capital to explain the nature
of the relationships but did not directly assess either component directly. While, as noted, prior
research on turnover has used these models, a more integrated analysis of these theories would
provide greater insight into the effects of turnover. For example, a more direct assessment of
human capital might take into consideration the years of experience and level of education for
the nurses working in outpatient centres as this has been identiﬁed as an important factor in
patient mortality (Aiken, 2003). The social capital component could be assessed by examining
levels of trust and information sharing among employees within organisations. Third, our
measure of waiting time can be inﬂuenced by environmental factors outside of the control of
nurses, such as natural variations in demand for appointments or the supply of appointment
slots. Although nurses do play an important role in helping their organisations adjust to such
shifts in demand, some organisations may face more frequent and/or powerful shifts that
introduce some level of bias to this measure of operating performance.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our current investigation of turnover, group-oriented organisational culture and
performance indicates that employee turnover does have a negative effect on operational
performance in organisations with knowledge workers but that organisations with strong
group-oriented organisational cultures are somewhat protected from these negative effects.
