integration   on   both   delivery   and  ﬂexibility   performance.   However,   the   theory   is   not   supported   for   either
quality   or   cost   performance.   Overall,   our   study   conﬁrms   and   extends   the   work   of   Frohlich   and   Westbrook,
augments   theories   used   to   describe   supply   chain   integration   efforts,   and   provides   practical   implications
for   managers.

1.  Introduction

Research  identiﬁes  supply  chain  integration  activities  as  impor-
tant  contributors  to  a  ﬁrm’s  success.  The  literature  broadly  deﬁnes
supply  chain  integration  as  the  extent  to  which  a  ﬁrm  is  strate-
gically  interconnected  and  aligned  with  its  supply  chain  partners
(e.g.,  Das  et  al.,  2006;  Jayaram  et  al.,  2010).  Integration  with  sup-
pliers  and  customers  enables  ﬁrms  to  better  manage  the  smooth
and  efﬁcient  ﬂow  of  products  through  the  supply  chain,  and  pro-
vides  access  to  resources  and  capabilities  at  supply  chain  partners
that  otherwise  may   have  been  costly  to  develop  internally.  Multiple
research  efforts  have  empirically  associated  supply  chain  integra-
tion  with  increased  performance  (e.g.,  Braunscheidel  and  Suresh,
2009;  Flynn  et  al.,  2010;  Koufteros  et  al.,  2007;  Swink  et  al.,  2007;
Wong  et  al.,  2011;  Zhao  et  al.,  2011).

A  seminal  paper  by  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  detailed  an
early  examination  of  supply  chain  integration.  The  authors  for-
warded  an  “arcs  of  integration”  concept,  in  which  they  deﬁned
ﬁve  strategy  groups  based  upon  different  combinations  (“arcs”)

levels  of  supplier  and  customer 

of 
integration  ranging  from
“inward-facing”  to  “outward-facing”.  The  authors  concluded  that
a  comprehensive  external  integration  strategy  involving  intense
relationships  with  both  suppliers  and  customers  outperformed
other  integration  strategies.  Numerous  subsequent  studies  have
drawn  conceptually  upon  this  “arcs  of  integration”  framework
and  related  insights,  attesting  to  the  popularity  of  the  concept.
For  example,  the  work  has  been  used  to  stress  the  importance
of  integrating  with  supply  chain  partners  (both  customers  and
suppliers),  to  describe  characteristics  of  information  sharing  with
supply  chain  partners,  and  as  a  source  of  measurement  items
for  subsequent  research  (Jayaram  et  al.,  2010;  Swink  et  al.,
2007).

The  objectives  of  our  research  are  to  cross-validate  and  extend
the  important  ﬁndings  from  the  original  Frohlich  and  Westbrook
(2001)  study.  Such  empirical  corroboration  and  extension  is  cru-
cial  for  the  integrity  of  research,  for  further  theory  development
(Tsang  and  Kwan,  1999),  and  for  ascertaining  the  predictive  validity
and  generalizability  of  theory  (Douglas  and  Craig,  2005).  Frohlich
and  Westbrook  (2001)  themselves  noted  that  “this  classiﬁcation
could  be  of  potential  value  to  future  researchers  and  is  capa-
ble  of  further  reﬁnement”  (p.  195).  We   stress,  however,  that  our
study  is  not  a  pure  replication  of  Frohlich  and  Westbrook’s  (2001)
work;  rather,  it  is  a  cross-validation  and  extension  of  their  ﬁndings,
and  thus  provides  a  more  contemporaneous  view  of  supply  chain

integration.  Speciﬁcally,  we  offer  three  main  contributions  to
extant  research.

Our  ﬁrst  contribution  is  to  develop  a  more  ﬁrmly  grounded
theoretical  rationale  for  the  effects  of  supply  chain  integration  on
performance.  Much  has  been  written  about  supply  chain  integra-
tion  in  the  decade  since  Frohlich  and  Westbrook’s  (2001)  work  was
published.  We   review  the  research  literature  and  develop  solid  the-
oretical  arguments  for  the  expected  direct  and  interacting  effects
of  external  and  internal  integration  efforts  by  drawing  upon  two
venerable  perspectives:  the  relational  and  resource-based  views  of
the  ﬁrm  (Barney,  1991;  Dyer  and  Singh,  1998;  Wernerfelt,  1984)
and  information  processing  theory  (Cohen  and  Levinthal,  1990;
Galbraith,  1973;  Thompson,  1967).

Secondly,  to  determine  whether  the  “arcs  of  integration”  con-
cept  is  robust  to  sampling  differences  and  over  time,  we  analyse
survey  responses  from  403  supply  chain  professionals.  Our  analy-
sis  compares  the  arcs  of  integration  group  membership  generated
with  our  sample  to  the  original  study,  and  rationalizes  the  classi-
ﬁcation  scheme.  In  addition,  we  test  the  criterion  validity  of  the
arcs  of  integration  concept  by  evaluating  the  performance  impacts
of  various  integration  strategies.  This  investigation  is  important,
since  while  the  supply  chain  integration  concept  is  foundational
to  many  research  studies,  ambiguity  and  inconsistency  in  research
ﬁndings  and  ensuing  interpretations  still  remain  (Flynn  et  al.,  2010;
Zhao  et  al.,  2011).  Our  large,  multi-country,  multi-industry  dataset
affords  us  the  opportunity  to  examine  the  predictive  validity  and
generalizability  of  the  “arcs  of  integration”  concept,  thus  answer-
ing  the  call  for  such  research  issued  by  Frohlich  and  Westbrook
(2001).  Furthermore,  our  study  incorporates  a  multi-dimensional
set  of  performance  measures  and  control  variables,  augmenting
their  research  design.

Our  cross-validation  also  addresses  four  limitations  of  the  origi-
nal  study.  First,  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  sampled  fabricated
metal  products,  machinery,  and  equipment  manufacturers;  they
noted  that  there  may   be  particular  characteristics  to  these  supply
chains  that  do  not  apply  to  other  sectors.  Our  dataset  includes  a
broader  set  of  manufacturing  industries,  as  well  as  distribution  and
retail  ﬁrms.  Second,  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  analysed  sur-
vey  responses  from  manufacturing  managers,  and  called  for  future
research  to  include  purchasing  and  marketing  representatives  to
better  gauge  supplier  and  customer  integration.  We   collected  data
from  supply  chain  professionals  at  the  director  level  and  above,
also  including  purchasing  and  marketing  managers.  Third,  the
Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  study  represents  managers’  per-
ceptions  from  over  10  years  ago.  We   provide  an  updated  view  from
a  decade  later,  a  decade  that  has  witnessed  an  enormous  prolifera-
tion  of  internet-based  and  other  integration-oriented  technologies.
Finally,  we  address  other  methodological  aspects  of  Frohlich  and
Westbrook’s  (2001)  ﬁndings.  For  example,  the  authors  indicated
that  over  40%  of  their  sample  was  in  the  periphery-facing  group
(characterized  by  medium-levels  of  customer  and  supplier  integra-
tion),  and  they  speculated  as  to  whether  this  is  a  “natural  point  of
equilibrium”  in  supply  chain  development.  We   address  this  ques-
tion.

integration  strategy  (arc  of 

The  third  contribution  of  this  research  is  extension.  We   extend
Frohlich  and  Westbrook’s  (2001)  study  by  investigating  the  mod-
erating  role  of  internal  integration  on  the  relationship  between
integration)  and  perfor-
external 
mance.  As  a  newer,  third  dimension  of  supply  chain  integration,
researchers  have  recently  recognized  internal  integration  as  a  cru-
cial  building  block  for  “complete”  supply  chain  integration  leading
to  superior  ﬁrm  performance  (Flynn  et  al.,  2010;  Koufteros  et  al.,
2010;  Wong  et  al.,  2011).  However,  there  is  limited  empirical
evidence  on  the  relationship  between  internal  and  external  integra-
tion  (Hillebrand  and  Biemans,  2003;  Zhao  et  al.,  2011),  and  ﬁndings
have  been  conﬂicting.  While  some  studies  postulated  the  inﬂuence

of  internal  integration  on  external  integration  (Braunscheidel  and
Suresh,  2009),  others  suggested  a  reverse  relationship  (Salvador
et  al.,  2001).  Our  contention,  which  is  grounded  in  information  pro-
cessing  theory,  is  that  internal  integration  efforts  complement  and
amplify  the  positive  performance  impacts  of  greater  arcs  of  external
integration.

2.  Theoretical  background  and  hypothesis  development

2.1.  Deﬁnition  and  dimensions  of  supply  chain  integration

Research  on  supply  chain  integration  has  offered  numerous
deﬁnitions  and  dimensions  characterizing  the  concept.  While
some  studies  have  utilized  a  uni-dimensional  operationalization
(Cousins  and  Menguc,  2006),  others  have  differentiated  between
internal  and  external  integration  (Stank  et  al.,  2001),  or  only  focused
on  the  external  integration  dimension  (Devaraj  et  al.,  2007).

Following  most  recent  research  in  this  domain  (Wong  et  al.,
2011;  Zhao  et  al.,  2011),  we   conceptualize  supply  chain  integra-
tion  as  consisting  of  the  three  dimensions  of  supplier,  customer
and  internal  integration.  Thus,  supply  chain  integration  involves
both  inter-organizational  (customer  and  supplier  integration)  and
intra-organizational  (internal  integration)  interfaces  that  facilitate
coordination  and  the  effective  and  efﬁcient  ﬂows  of  information,
material,  money,  and  decisions,  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  maximiz-
ing  customer  value  (cf.  Flynn  et  al.,  2010;  Zhao  et  al.,  2011).

Customer  and  supplier  integration  are  the  external  integration
dimensions  that  form  the  fundamental  components  of  Frohlich
and  Westbrook’s  (2001)  arcs  of  integration  concept.  Customer
integration  refers  to  close  collaboration  and  information  sharing
activities  with  key  customers  that  provide  the  ﬁrm  with  strate-
gic  insights  into  market  expectations  and  opportunities  (Wong
et  al.,  2011),  ultimately  enabling  a  more  efﬁcient  and  effective
response  to  customer  needs  (Swink  et  al.,  2007).  Supplier  integra-
tion  involves  coordination  and  information  sharing  activities  with
key  suppliers  that  provide  the  ﬁrm  with  insights  into  suppliers’
processes,  capabilities  and  constraints,  ultimately  enabling  more
effective  planning  and  forecasting,  product  and  process  design,  and
transaction  management  (Ragatz  et  al.,  2002).  In  contrast,  internal
integration  refers  to  cross-functional  intra-ﬁrm  collaboration  and
information  sharing  activities  that  occur  via  interconnected  and
synchronized  processes  and  systems  (Morash  and  Clinton,  1998).
Along  with  beneﬁts,  integration  activities  also  involve  costs.
Greater  levels  of  integration  may   require  investments  in  more
involved  and  expensive  communication  protocols  and  technolo-
gies.  Some  researchers  suggest  that 
lead  to
decreased  innovation  potential,  as  well  as  greater  inﬂexibility  due
to  greater  interdependence  (Sorenson,  2003).  Thus,  elaborate  inte-
gration  regimes  may   not  always  be  appropriate,  depending  on
the  nature  of  a  ﬁrm’s  products  (Fisher,  1997)  and  its  compet-
itive  priorities.  In  general,  however,  researchers  have  supposed
that  the  beneﬁts  derived  from  integration  activities  outweigh  their
associated  costs,  leading  to  overall  greater  levels  of  operational
performance.

2.2.  Cross-validating  the  link  to  performance

We   deﬁne  performance  as  a  ﬁrm’s  ability  to  achieve  abnor-
mally  positive  operational  outcomes  relative  to  their  competitors.
While  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  classiﬁed  their  performance
measures  into  the  groups  of  marketplace-,  productivity-  and  non-
productivity-related  measures,  we   examine  the  more  conventional
operational  dimensions  of  quality,  delivery,  ﬂexibility  and  cost
(Schmenner  and  Swink,  1998).  Because  supply  chain  integration
is  an  enterprise  wide  phenomenon,  we   adopted  performance

measures  that  were  consistent  with  the  supply  chain  operations
reference  (SCOR)  model  to  reﬂect  these  four  capabilities.

A  substantial  research  stream  has  examined  the  impacts  of
supply  chain  integration  on  performance;  Appendix  A  provides
a  representative  sample  of  studies.  Empirical  ﬁndings  have  been
mixed.  For  example,  researchers  have  linked  supplier  integration
to  better  product  development  performance  (Koufteros  et  al.,  2007;
Ragatz  et  al.,  2002),  yet  they  have  found  links  of  supplier  integration
to  other  dimensions  of  performance  to  be  not  signiﬁcant  (Cousins
and  Menguc,  2006;  Flynn  et  al.,  2010;  Stank  et  al.,  2001)  or  even
negative  (Narasimhan  et  al.,  2010;  Swink  et  al.,  2007).  In  their  dis-
course  on  the  positive  and  negative  effects  of  supplier  integration,
Das  et  al.  (2006,  p.  568)  went  so  far  as  to  refer  to  the  concept
as  “an  ambivalent  intervention  in  terms  of  impact.”  The  ﬁndings
for  customer  integration  are  similarly  inconsistent.  For  example,
researchers  have  reported  positive  relationships  to  product  innova-
tion,  quality,  and  market  success  (Koufteros  et  al.,  2005),  logistical
performance  (Germain  and  Iyer,  2006),  and  quality,  delivery,  ﬂex-
ibility  and  cost  performance  (Wong  et  al.,  2011).  However,  others
were  unable  to  conﬁrm  signiﬁcant  links  to  glitches  and  on-time
execution  of  engineering  changes  (Koufteros  et  al.,  2010),  opera-
tional  performance  (Devaraj  et  al.,  2007),  or  business  performance
(Flynn  et  al.,  2010).

Many  researchers  have  built  arguments  for  the  value  of  supply
chain  integration  upon  the  resource-based  view  of  the  ﬁrm  (RBV)
(Chen  et  al.,  2009;  Das  et  al.,  2006;  Devaraj  et  al.,  2007;  Rosenzweig
et  al.,  2003;  Swink  et  al.,  2007;  Wang  and  Wei,  2007).  The  RBV  for-
wards  the  notion  that  ﬁrms  differentiate  themselves  by  employing
their  unique  resources  in  distinctive  ways  that  cannot  be  eas-
ily  replicated  (Barney,  1991;  Wernerfelt,  1984).  The  development
of  such  resources  is  often  founded  upon  relation-speciﬁc  orga-
nizational  routines  (Holweg  and  Pil,  2008),  and  tacit-knowledge
intensive  processes  (Rosenzweig  et  al.,  2003).

The  supply  chain  researchers  cited  above  have  focused  on  “rela-
tional”  resources  associated  with  supply  chain  integration.  For
example,  Wang  and  Wei   (2007)  describe  supply  chain  integration
as  a  means  for  creating  a  system  of  integrative  and  effective  rela-
tional  governance.  As  ﬁrms  gain  competence  in  managing  intensive
supply  chain  integration  processes,  they  are  able  to  acquire  and
exploit  unique  knowledge  in  ways  that  improve  transactional  efﬁ-
ciencies,  solve  problems,  and  identify  new  product  and  business
opportunities  (Chen  et  al.,  2009;  Das  et  al.,  2006;  Rosenzweig  et  al.,
2003;  Swink  et  al.,  2007).  To  develop  such  organizational  skills,
a  ﬁrm  typically  must  work  on  creating  effective  communication
protocols,  shared  understandings  and  languages,  and  shared  col-
laborative  values  with  supply  chain  partners.  As  it  does  so,  the  ﬁrm
grows  its  relational,  collaborative  competence.  This  competence
serves  as  a  key  resource  that  provides  operational  and  competitive
advantages  (Cao  and  Zhang,  2011;  Mishra  and  Shah,  2009).

Applying  these  theoretical  foundations,  we  expect  that  greater
levels  of  integration  with  customers  and  suppliers  (i.e.  greater  arcs
of  integration)  positively  inﬂuence  quality,  delivery,  ﬂexibility  and
cost  performance.  Supply  chain  integration  involves  organizational
routines  that  are  developed  between  ﬁrms.  These  connections  cre-
ate  distinctive  pairings  of  individual  capabilities  that  are  built  upon
tacit,  heterogeneous,  and  context-speciﬁc  knowledge.  For  example,
higher  integration  intensity  is  often  reﬂected  by  joint  commit-
ments,  dedicated  relationships,  and  co-developed  systems  that
may   be  peculiar  to  the  capabilities,  knowledge  assets,  and  other
characteristics  of  speciﬁc  dyads  of  supply  chain  partners  (Swink
et  al.,  2007).

Accordingly,  inter-ﬁrm  integration  can  create  combinations
of  unique  skills,  knowledge,  and  joint  capabilities.  For  instance,
greater  integration  intensity  is  likely  to  produce  product  quality
improvements  through  quicker  identiﬁcation  and  communica-
tion  of  challenges, 
joint  problem  solving  efforts,  and  deeper

understanding  of  the  interdependencies  among  supply  chain  pro-
cesses  (Deming,  1982).  In  addition,  research  shows  that  idea
generation  and  evaluation  conducted  jointly  with  both  suppliers
and  customers  can  lead  to  better  product  design  and  launch  qual-
ity  (Clark,  1989).  External  integration  can  also  beneﬁt  delivery  and
ﬂexibility  performance  by  providing  more  accurate  and  up-to-date
demand  and  supply  information,  more  detailed  production  plans
and  forecasts,  and  clearer  future  trends  and  directions  (Lee  et  al.,
1997).  Through  external  integration  efforts,  supply  chain  partners
are  better  able  to  understand  and  anticipate  each  other’s  needs,
reducing  uncertainties  (Swink  et  al.,  2007)  and  enabling  better  per-
formance  capabilities  inherent  in  quality,  delivery,  ﬂexibility  and
cost.

Like  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001),   our  study  differentiates
itself  from  other  studies  of  external  integration  in  that  it  exam-
ines  combinations  of  supplier  and  customer  integration  efforts,
highlighting  the  importance  of  balancing  supply  constraints  and
demand  requirements  across  the  supply  chain.  This  suggests  that
synergies  might  emerge  when  a  ﬁrm  possesses  superior  knowledge
resources  regarding  both  opportunities  and  boundary  conditions
in  both  demand  and  supply  markets.  As  Frohlich  and  Westbrook
(2001,  p.  194)  maintained,  myopic  supplier-focused  or  customer-
focused 
integration  efforts  “are  not  making  use  of  their  full
potential  by  focusing  on  only  one  side  of  their  supply  chains.”  Based
on  our  theoretical  perspective  and  the  ﬁndings  described  above,  we
expect  that  a  greater  scope  (“arc”)  of  integration  efforts  increasingly
adds  to  performance.

Hypothesis  1  (a–d).  A  greater  arc  of  combined  supplier  and  cus-
tomer  integration  is  associated  with  greater  levels  of  (a)  quality,
(b)  delivery,  (c)  ﬂexibility  and  (d)  cost  performance.  Speciﬁcally,
ﬁrms  that  engage  in  more  comprehensive  integration  regimes,
from  inward-facing  to  outward-facing,  exhibit  greater  levels  of
operational  performance  in  each  of  the  four  dimensions.

2.3.  The  moderating  role  of  internal  integration

Recently,  researchers  have  highlighted  the 

importance  of
internal  integration  as  part  of  a  “complete”  conceptualization
of  supply  chain  integration,  and  a  growing  literature  provides
emergent  insights.  Consistent  empirical  ﬁndings  indicate  that
internal  integration  positively  inﬂuences  outcomes  related  to  logis-
tical  performance  (Germain  and  Iyer,  2006),  supply  chain  agility
(Braunscheidel  and  Suresh,  2009),  operational  and  business  perfor-
mance  (Flynn  et  al.,  2010),  and  quality,  delivery,  ﬂexibility  and  cost
(Wong  et  al.,  2011).  Researchers  argue  that  internal  integration  fos-
ters  better  intra-ﬁrm  goal  alignment  among  supply  chain  functions
(e.g.,  purchasing,  planning,  manufacturing,  and  logistics)  through
better  information  sharing  and  cross-functional  collaboration.  Such
integration  also  enables  the  utilization  of  each  function’s  strengths
and  competencies,  and  points  out  functional  interdependencies
(Pagell,  2004).  Somewhat  surprisingly,  however,  supply  chain  man-
agers  often  perceive  that  their  companies  are  more  accomplished  in
external  integration  efforts  than  they  are  in  internal  efforts  (Poirier
et  al.,  2008).

Despite  the  growing  body  of  knowledge  surrounding  internal
integration,  its  relationship  to  external  integration  remains  some-
what  obscured  by  contradictory  ﬁndings  (Zhao  et  al.,  2011).  Some
studies  have  treated  internal  integration  as  a  precursor  to  exter-
nal  integration  efforts  (Braunscheidel  and  Suresh,  2009;  Koufteros
et  al.,  2010;  Zhao  et  al.,  2011),  while  others  have  investigated
the  interaction  of  internal  and  external  integration.  Germain  and
Iyer  (2006)  found  support  for  the  positive  moderating  role  of
internal  integration  on  the  relationship  between  customer  integra-
tion  and  logistical  performance.  Flynn  et  al.  (2010)  hypothesized
moderating  roles  of  both  customer  and  supplier  integration  on

the  relationship  between  internal  integration  and  operational  and
business  performance.  The  results  of  their  data  analyses  did  not
support  either  hypothesis.

Our  research  differentiates  itself  from  prior  studies  in  that  we
consider  both  customer  and  supplier  integration  simultaneously
as  we  examine  the  moderating  effect  of  internal  integration  on  the
relationship  between  external  integration  (operationalized  via  the
arcs  of  integration  framework)  and  a  broader  set  of  operational
measures.  In  addition  to  differences  in  operationalization,  our  study
is  perhaps  even  more  importantly  distinguished  by  its  theoretical
grounding.  In  our  view,  internal  integration  creates  information
processing  capabilities  that  enable  the  absorption  and  applica-
tion  of  knowledge  attained  through  external  integration  processes.
Early  researchers  identiﬁed  the  importance  of  information  process-
ing  capabilities  in  organizations  (Galbraith,  1973;  Thompson,  1967;
Tushman  and  Nadler,  1978).  Within  this  context,  information  pro-
cessing  theory  (IPT)  explains  organizational  behavior  “in  terms  of
information  that  must  be  gathered,  interpreted,  synthesized,  and
coordinated  in  the  context  of  decision  making”  (Burns  and  Wholey,
1993,  p.  110).  Such  behavior  is  constrained  by  bounded  rational-
ity,  which  suggests  that  a  single  entity  can  never  have  complete
knowledge  regarding  a  decision.  In  an  attempt  to  improve  decision
making,  managers  typically  apply  logical  rules,  procedures,  organi-
zational  structures,  and  other  strategies  for  information  processing
(Galbraith,  1973;  Gattiker  and  Goodhue,  2004).

While  others  have  employed  IPT  to  argue  for  the  direct  beneﬁts
of  internal  integration  (Hult  et  al.,  2004;  Rosenzweig  et  al.,  2003;
Swink  et  al.,  2007;  Wong  et  al.,  2011),  we  posit  that  information
processing  capability  created  by  internal  integration  also  serves  as
an  important  complement  to  external  integration  processes.  Inter-
nal  integration  efforts  are  often  characterized  by  interconnected
information  systems  and  approaches  aimed  at  improving  lateral
relations  (e.g.,  cross-functional  teams,  liaison  roles,  etc.).  These
efforts  provide  linkages  by  which  externally  sourced  information
can  be  internally  absorbed  (Egelhoff,  1991;  Morash  and  Clinton,
1998;  Zhao  et  al.,  2011).  Cohen  and  Levinthal  (1990,  p.  128)  deﬁne
absorptive  capacity  as  “the  ability  of  a  ﬁrm  to  recognize  the  value  of
new,  external  information,  assimilate  it,  and  apply  it  to  commercial
ends.”  A  ﬁrm’s  level  of  internal  integration  can  thus  be  viewed  as
the  source  of  its  capability  to  effectively  absorb  (recognize,  evalu-
ate,  assimilate,  and  apply)  the  information  it  collects  via  external
supply  chain  integration  efforts.

A  ﬁrm  that  has  greater  internal  integration  should  be  better  able
to  transform  and  exploit  knowledge  obtained  via  external  integra-
tion,  because  through  established  rules,  systems,  procedures,  and
cross-functional  relations,  its  internal  personnel  can  more  easily
and  effectively  share  and  access  the  information.  Parallels  can  be
drawn  to  the  ﬁndings  in  Hult  et  al.  (2004),   who  employed  infor-
mation  processing  perspectives  to  argue  for  the  positive  impact  of
a  “shared  meaning”  from  internal  integration  on  operating  perfor-
mance.  More  generally,  Hillebrand  and  Biemans  (2003)  proposed
that  internal  cooperation  is  required  for  effective  learning  and  coor-
dination  that  stem  from  external  cooperation.  Internal  integration
extends  the  bounded  rationality  with  which  decisions  are  made,
as  it  enables  a  wider  range  of  personnel  to  participate  in  joint
evaluations  and  planning  for  the  use  of  knowledge  content.  In  addi-
tion,  with  enhanced  internal  integration,  relevant  information  from
external  partners  can  be  channeled  most  effectively  and  efﬁciently
to  the  most  appropriate  internal  constituents,  where  opportuni-
ties  are  more  likely  to  be  recognized,  and  a  deeper  meaning  can  be
generated  (Swink  et  al.,  2007).

Information  technologies  and  enterprise  resource  planning  sys-
tems  that  span  multiple  agents  provide  cases  in  point  (Gattiker
and  Goodhue,  2004).  These  elements  create  the  infrastructure  of
internal  integration,  which  creates  a  fertile  ground  in  which  new
opportunities  identiﬁed  through  external  integration  efforts  can

take  root.  In  contrast,  if  insights  derived  from  external  integration
hit  a  “disintegrative  wall”  inside  the  ﬁrm,  its  potential  to  impact
performance  is  likely  to  be  lost  (Germain  and  Iyer,  2006,  p.  33).
Overall,  internal  integration  processes  are  expected  to  improve  the
recognition,  dissemination  and  application  of  valuable  knowledge
gathered  through  external  integration  processes,  enabling  better
decisions  that  lead  to  higher  quality  and  more  impactful  opera-
tional  improvements.  Accordingly,  we   hypothesize  the  following:

Hypothesis  2  (a–d).  Greater  internal  integration  strengthens  the
relationship  between  increasingly  outward  focused  arcs  of  external
integration  and  (a)  quality,  (b)  delivery,  (c)  ﬂexibility  and  (d)  cost
performance.

3.  Research  methods

3.1.  Sample

We  used  data  collected  for  the  annual  Global  Survey  of  Supply
Chain  Progress  to  test  our  hypotheses.  This  cross-sectional  survey
is  the  outcome  of  collaborative  efforts  between  a  large  Midwestern
university,  the  Council  of  Supply  Chain  Management  Profession-
als  (CSCMP),  Computer  Sciences  Corporation,  and  the  magazines
Supply  Chain  Management  Review  and  Supply  Chain  Europe.   For  the
present  study  we   utilized  data  collected  in  the  ﬁfth  and  sixth  rounds
of  the  survey,  which  were  administered  in  2007  and  2008.

The  survey  was   developed  for  a  single  respondent  with  the
organization  serving  as  the  unit  of  analysis.  As  such,  our  research
utilizes  an  embedded  design,  in  which  the  organization  is  viewed
as  “embedded  in  a  network  of  relationships  that  impact  its  perfor-
mance”  (Saraf  et  al.,  2007,  p.  327).  Although  a  multiple-respondent,
dyadic  or  even  triadic  survey  design  would  have  been  preferable,
surveying  customers  and  suppliers  directly,  a  single-respondent
design  was  elected  to  achieve  an  acceptable  response  rate  (Saraf
et  al.,  2007).  Measurement  items  were  therefore  also  kept  as  sim-
ple  as  possible  to  ensure  that  the  single-respondent  could  provide
accurate  answers  to  all  questions.  This  is  consistent  with  recent
approaches  for  studying  inter-organizational  phenomena  (Rai  and
Tang,  2010;  Flynn  et  al.,  2010).

The  sampling  frame  for  the  survey  included  supply  chain  exec-
utives  and  managers  located  around  the  world.  Senior  supply  chain
managers  in  procurement,  operations  and  logistics  functions  were
targeted.  The  research  team  sent  e-mail  invitations  to  readers  of
the  Supply  Chain  Management  Review,   clients  of  the  Computer  Sci-
ences  Corporation  supply  chain  consulting  division,  and  a  list  of
former  participants  of  supply  chain  executive  education  programs
at  a  large  Midwestern  university.  Three  waves  of  invitations  were
sent  over  an  eight-week  period.  In  addition,  advertisements  invit-
ing  participation  in  the  internet  based  survey  were  posted  on  the
journal  and  participating  corporate  web  sites.

Following  the  key  informant  approach,  we   carefully  screened
the  responses  and  eliminated  those  whose  titles  were  not  directly
related  to  supply  chain  functions  (Wall  et  al.,  2004).  Most  sur-
vey  respondents  held  titles  such  as  Chief  Executive  Ofﬁcer,  Vice
President,  Director  of  Logistics,  and  Chief  Procurement  Ofﬁcer.
Respondents  that  had  inappropriate  titles  or  organization  types
(non-businesses,  health-care)  were  deleted  from  the  sample.  A
total  of  403  usable  responses  were  received,  141  for  2007  and  262
for  2008.  Respondents  came  from  27  different  industries,  including
process  manufacturing  (14.3%),  consumer  goods  (13.8%),  discrete
manufacturing  (11.2%),  retail  (7.4%),  third-party  logistics  (5.9%),
wholesale  and  distribution  (5.7%),  high  tech  (5.2%),  aerospace  and
defense  (4.3%),  and  chemicals  (4.0%).  Overall,  63.9%  of  ﬁrms  were
involved  in  manufacturing,  whereas  the  remaining  36.1%  were
involved  in  distribution  or  retail  activities,  thus  being  positioned
farther  down  the  supply  chain.  Respondents  came  from  39  differ-
ent  countries,  with  the  North  American  region  representing  the

strongest  contingent  (73.8%).  We   recorded  about  an  equal  num-
ber  of  respondents  coming  from  the  Asia-Paciﬁc  region  (12.3%)
and  Europe  (9.7%),  and  the  lowest  response  from  Latin  and  South
America  (4.2%).  In  our  ensuing  analysis  we  control  for  these  con-
tingencies.

In  terms  of  size,  most  respondents  were  from  large  ﬁrms  with
annual  sales  greater  than  $1  billion  (49.7%).  A  large  proportion  of
our  sample  also  represented  companies  that  reported  annual  sales
of  $250  million  or  below  (29.2%).  The  remaining  21.1%  of  the  sample
fell  in  between  these  two  extremes  (11.6%  recorded  annual  sales
between  $215  and  $500  million,  and  9.5%  between  $500  million
and  $1  billion).  We   controlled  for  ﬁrm  size  in  our  subsequent  anal-
ysis  and  performed  a  size-invariance  robustness  check  (reported  in
Section  5.3).

Given  the  method  used  to  invite  participants,  it  is  not  possible  to
know  the  number  of  contacted  potential  respondents  who  met   our
targeted  criteria.  Thus,  because  calculation  of  a  response  rate  was
not  possible  or  relevant,  we  used  the  respondent  data  and  general
industry  information  to  assess  potential  response  biases  and  sam-
ple  representativeness.  As  such,  we  tested  for  nonresponse  bias  in
two  ways.  First,  we  compared  return  on  assets  of  the  sampled  ﬁrms
with  their  respective  industry  median  values  using  paired  sample
t-tests.  Our  results  showed  that  there  were  no  statistically  signif-
icant  differences  (p  >  .05)  between  the  sample  ﬁrms  and  industry
median  values,  suggesting  that  performance  was   not  a  source  of
bias.  Second,  no  statistically  signiﬁcant  differences  were  detected
in  the  responses  for  any  of  the  measurement  items  across  early  (ﬁrst
25%)  and  late  respondents  (last  25%)  in  both  years  (Armstrong  and
Overton,  1977),  suggesting  that  nonresponse  bias  is  not  a  serious
concern.

3.2.  Measures

Measurement  items  were  developed  through  a  close  collabora-
tion  between  academics  and  practicing  managers,  ensuring  both
theoretical  grounding  in  research  and  practical  relevance  in  indus-
try.  While  almost  all  measurement  items  were  adapted  from  prior
sources  (e.g.,  Koufteros  et  al.,  2005;  Swink  et  al.,  2007),  a  few  item
additions  and  revisions  were  provided  by  a  team  of  more  than
ten  participants  including  representatives  from  CSCMP,  Computer
Sciences  Corporation,  and  editors  of  Supply  Chain  Management
Review  and  Supply  Chain  Europe,  who  reviewed  both  the  2007  and
2008  surveys  for  item  content,  understandability,  and  reasonable-
ness  regarding  expectations  for  respondent  knowledge.  This  group
of  reviewers  provided  exceptional  subject  matter  expertise,  as  it
included  practicing  supply  chain  managers,  consultants  who   had
interacted  with  numerous  companies,  and  editors  who  had  encom-
passing  perspectives  of  the  ﬁeld  of  supply  chain  management.

Consistent  with  our  theoretical  grounding  and  the  deﬁnitions
introduced  above,  measurement  items  for  supplier  and  customer
integration  assessed  the  degree  to  which  more  involved,  synchro-
nized  and  proactive  relationships  are  sought.  Internal  integration
was  measured  by  the  extent  to  which  intra-ﬁrm  functional  teams
(operations,  logistics,  sales,  marketing,  supply  management)  work

together  to  accomplish  supply  chain  planning  and  execution.  Simi-
lar  as  in  Das  and  Joshi  (2007),   we   employed  the  mean  split  method
in  later  analyses  to  generate  a  dichotomous  variable  dividing  our
sample  in  a  group  with  high  internal  integration  and  a  group  with
low  internal  integration.  Performance  was  assessed  on  17  differ-
ent  operational  outcomes  related  to  quality,  delivery,  ﬂexibility
and  cost  performance  dimensions  developed  in  the  SCOR  model
(Bolstroff,  2002).  Appendix  B  provides  the  exact  wording  of  the
measures,  and  Table  1  presents  summary  statistics  and  correla-
tions  of  our  seven  main  constructs.  Of  note  in  Table  1  are  the  lower
means  for  internal  integration  compared  to  supplier  and  customer
integration.  This  is  consistent  with  comments  we  received  from
practitioners  in  informal  conversations,  i.e.  that  their  ﬁrms  are  pro-
ﬁcient  in  external  integration,  but  that  internal  integration  is  still
lacking.  Internal  integration  seems  to  be  the  more  difﬁcult  compe-
tence  to  achieve.

We   executed  a  conﬁrmatory  factor  analysis  (CFA)  to  validate
the  measures  and  to  compute  factor  scores  of  the  measurement
items.  The  results  of  the  CFA  indicate  overall  good  model  ﬁt  and  sug-
gest  no  modiﬁcation  to  the  speciﬁed  factor  structure  ((cid:2)2 =  820.239,
df  =  384,  RMSEA  =  .051,  NFI  =  .942,  NNFI  =  .964,  CFI  =  .968,  IFI  =  .968).
Measures  for  customer  integration  loaded  strongly  on  the  customer
integration  construct,  measures  for  supplier  integration  loaded
strongly  on  the  supplier  integration  construct,  and  measures  for
internal  integration  loaded  strongly  on  the  internal  integration  con-
struct.  For  our  performance  constructs  assessing  quality,  delivery,
ﬂexibility  and  cost  performance,  three  measurement  items  were
removed  due  to  weak  item-loadings,  cross-loadings,  small  t-values,
and  theoretical  determination.  Though  the  loading  for  FP1,  pro-
duction  ﬂexibility,  fell  just  below  conventionally  acceptable  values
(0.445  <  0.500),  we   kept  the  item  because  of  its  strong  content  valid-
ity.  Table  2  summarizes  the  test  statistics  of  the  ﬁnal  measurement
items.

Validity  and  reliability  were  assessed  via  approaches  suggested
by  Anderson  and  Gerbing  (1988).   First,  content  validity  was  estab-
lished  by  the  close  collaboration  between  academics  and  industry
professionals  in  the  development  of  the  measurement  items,
as  noted  above.  Second,  convergent  validity  was   ensured  by  the
estimated  coefﬁcients  loading  signiﬁcantly  on  their  underlying
construct.  As  can  be  seen  in  Table  2,  the  coefﬁcients  are  always
greater  than  twice  their  standard  errors,  establishing  convergent
validity.  Third,  discriminant  validity  was   provided,  given  that  the
conﬁdence  interval  around  the  coefﬁcients  does  not  include  1.0.
Discriminant  validity  was  also  conﬁrmed  by  the  more  stringent
approach  of  comparing  the  average  variance  extracted  (AVE)  to
the  inter-construct  variances.  The  seven  values  for  the  square-root
of  the  AVE  were  all  greater  than  the  corresponding  correlations
(Table  1),  further  conﬁrming  discriminant  validity  (Fornell  and
Larcker,  1981).  Fourth,  unidimensionality  was  established  by  the
CFA  and  all  measurement  items  having  loadings  of  above  the  sug-
gested  minimum  of  0.30.  (O’Leary-Kelly  and  Vokurka,  1998).  Fifth,
reliability  was   provided  by  Cronbach’s  alpha  and  composite  reliabil-
ity  values  being  above  0.70.  (Fornell  and  Larcker,  1981).  And  ﬁnally,
construct  validity  was   ensured  by  conﬁrming  content  validity,

unidimensionality,  reliability,  convergent  and  discriminant  validity
(O’Leary-Kelly  and  Vokurka,  1998).

To  avoid  common  method  bias  we  grouped  the  independent  and
dependent  variables  in  different  sections  of  the  questionnaire  and
used  different  scale  types  (Podsakoff  et  al.,  2003).  Similar  to  Boyer
and  Hult  (2005),   we  assessed  the  potential  for  common-method
bias  via  the  Harman’s  one  factor  test.  The  single  factor  model
produced  a  signiﬁcantly  worse  ﬁt  than  the  model  with  the  differen-
tiated  measurement  items  ((cid:2)2 =  3053.742,  df  =  405,  RMSEA  =  .159,
NFI  =  .784,  NNFI  =  .792,  CFI  =  .807,  IFI  =  .807),  suggesting  that  com-
mon   method  bias  is  not  of  serious  concern  (Podsakoff  and  Organ,
1986).  Based  on  these  tests,  we  felt  that  we  could  conﬁdently  opera-
tionalize  the  arcs  of  integration  consisting  of  supplier  and  customer
integration,  internal  integration  and  the  performance  dimensions.
Five  control  variables  were  considered  in  the  present  study:  year
of  data  collection,  geographic  region  (North  America,  Asia-Paciﬁc,
Europe,  and  Latin  and  South  America),  annual  sales  (to  account
for  economies  of  scale  and  bargaining  power  associated  with  ﬁrm
size),  whether  manufacturing  activities  were  part  of  the  ﬁrm’s  busi-
ness  (being  indicative  of  a  ﬁrm’s  location  in  the  supply  chain),  and
industry.

3.3.  Methods  comparison

We   stress  that  our  study  is  not  a  pure  replication  of  Frohlich
and  Westbrook’s  (2001)  work.  Rather,  it  is  a  cross-validation  and
extension  of  their  ﬁndings.  We   also  note  that  replicating  a  study
does  not  necessarily  mean  to  literally  duplicate  it  without  making
any  changes  (Kerlinger  and  Lee,  2000).  However,  it  is  important
to  clearly  identify  methodological  differences.  Table  3  summarizes
the  key  methodological  design  and  sample  characteristics  of  our
study  in  comparison  to  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001).

We   further  highlight  differences  in  how  supplier  and  customer
integration  were  measured  in  the  two   studies.  While  the  general
content  domain  of  the  two  sets  of  measures  is  comparable,  the
integration  measures  in  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  relied  on
the  extent  to  which  knowledge  is  shared  with  customers  or  sup-
pliers  (access  to  planning  systems,  sharing  production  plans,  joint
EDI  access/networks,  knowledge  of  inventory  mix/levels),  logistics
responsiveness  (packaging  customization,  delivery  frequencies),
and  the  use  of  common  resources  (common  use  of  logistical  equip-
ment/containers,  common  use  of  third-party  logistics  services).
Respondents  to  their  survey  were  asked  to  indicate  the  extent  to
which  each  item  is  practiced  with  suppliers  or  customers  on  a  ﬁve-
point  scale  ranging  from  “none”  to  “extensive”.  In  contrast,  our
measures  for  customer  and  supplier  integration  are  grounded  in
and  adapted  from  recent  research  (e.g.,  Koufteros  et  al.,  2005;  Swink
et  al.,  2007),  and  measure  integrative  activities/behavior  pursued
between  the  ﬁrm  and  its  customers  or  suppliers.

Similarly  as  in  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001),   we  utilized
related  measures  to  assess  the  integration  on  both  sides;  how  inte-
gration  is  measured  with  customers  and  suppliers  thus  remains
comparable.  In  contrast  to  the  scales  utilized  in  the  original  study,
which  focused  on  knowledge  sharing  mechanisms/systems  and
types  of  knowledge,  our  scales  can  be  said  to  more  contemporary
and  to  be  more  directly  measuring  the  concept  of  integration.  The
measures  can  also  be  seen  as  an  evolution  of  the  early  integration
scales,  and  as  such,  as  an  improvement  of  these  measures  over  time.
The  scale  items  beneﬁted  from  their  application  and  validation  in
recent  integration  studies,  as  well  as  the  direct  validation  with
industry  practitioners  preceding  the  administration  of  the  ques-
tionnaire.  We   thus  believe  our  scales  to  represent  an  evolution  of
the  integration  scales  by  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001),   and  to
thus  be  comparable.

from   each  other.

While  we  grouped  our  performance  measures  into  the  four
competitive  dimensions,  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  relied  on
single  item  measures  grouped  into  three  categories:  marketplace,
productivity  and  non-productivity  performance  outcomes.  How-
ever,  upon  examination  of  their  speciﬁc  items,  most  of  their  items
can  be  roughly  classiﬁed  into  our  four  categories,  making  a  compar-
ison  possible.  Table  4  presents  selected  measures  of  Frohlich  and
Westbrook  (2001)  grouped  along  our  four  dimensions,  as  well  as  a
summary  of  their  primary  ﬁndings  pertaining  to  each  dimension.
We  will  refer  to  this  summary  later  when  we  compare  the  results.

4.  Operationalizing  the  classiﬁcation  scheme

To  evaluate  whether  the  arcs  of  integration  is  a  robust  con-
cept  we  proceed  with  the  operationalization  of  the  arcs  as  done
in  the  original  study,  and  then  compare  the  derived  group  mem-
bership  to  Frohlich  and  Westbrook’s  (2001)  results.  In  interpreting
these  ﬁndings  we  take  a  deeper  look  into  the  rationalization  of  the
classiﬁcation  scheme.

Consistent  with  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001),   we  grouped
respondents  into  quartiles  based  on  their  factor  scores  for  cus-
tomer  and  supplier  integration,  respectively,  and  then  classiﬁed
each  respondent  into  one  of  ﬁve  mutually  exclusive  groups.  These
groups  represent  “the  major  different  integration  strategies  that
.
.
.
  [ﬁrms]  could  undertake  in  relation  to  suppliers  and  customers”
(Frohlich  and  Westbrook,  2001,  p.  190).  Table  5  presents  the  ﬁve
strategies,  their  operationalizations,  and  group  membership  counts

 

 

for  our  sample  and  Frohlich  and  Westbrook’s  (2001)  sample.  We
note  that  this  classiﬁcation  considers  only  external  integration,  i.e.
the  “inward-facing”  strategy  denotes  a  lack  of  external  integration,
but  indicates  nothing  about  the  level  of  internal  integration.

In  the  same  manner  as  in  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001),   we
conducted  tests  to  ensure  that  the  ﬁve  groups  accurately  represent
covariances  in  the  data.  First,  we   grouped  the  respondents  into  ﬁve
groups  via  K-means  cluster  analysis  based  on  their  item  scores  for
customer  and  supplier  integration.  Cluster  membership  was  saved
and  compared  to  the  group  membership  determined  by  the  opera-
tionalization  from  above.  Similar  to  the  original  study,  the  Pearson’s
correlation  between  the  two   classiﬁcation  procedures  was   signiﬁ-
cant  (r  =  .109,  p  <  .05),  providing  support  for  the  conceptualization.
Second,  we  ran  discriminant  analysis  to  further  ensure  the  cor-
rect  classiﬁcation  of  the  respondents.  Similar  as  in  Frohlich  and
Westbrook  (2001),   we  listed  the  ten  supplier  and  customer  inte-
gration  activities  as  independent  variables,  and  the  ﬁve-group
classiﬁcation  as  the  dependent  variable.  The  result  of  83.1%  correct
classiﬁcations  (Table  6)  adds  support  for  the  validity  of  the  opera-
tionalization,  and  conﬁrms  the  ﬁndings  in  Frohlich  and  Westbrook
(2001),   who  reported  81.8%  correctly  classiﬁed  cases.  The  pattern
of  cases  correctly  classiﬁed  for  each  group  is  also  consistent  with
the  results  in  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001).2

2 To  further  test  the  robustness  of  the  ﬁndings,  we  conducted  a  discriminant  anal-
ysis  using  the  two  factor-score  constructs  as  independent  variables.  The  result  was

4.1.  Comparison  of  group  memberships

Using  a  one-sample  chi-square  difference  test  we  compared
the  group  membership  classiﬁcation  derived  from  our  sample
to  that  of  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  (Table  5),  which  sug-
gested  that  the  group  membership  proportions  in  our  sample
are  signiﬁcantly  different  to  the  proportions  received  by  Frohlich
and  Westbrook  (2001)  ((cid:2)2(4,  N  =  403)  =  20.340,  p  <  .001).  Post-
hoc  tests  based  on  the  standardized  residuals  showed  that  both
the  periphery-facing  strategy  and  outward-facing  strategy  were
more  frequently  observed  in  our  sample  than  in  the  Frohlich  and
Westbrook  (2001)  sample  (p  <  .001  and  p  <  .01,  respectively).  The
remaining  three  integration  strategies  were  signiﬁcantly  underrep-
resented  in  our  sample  (p  <  .05)  relative  to  Frohlich  and  Westbrook
(2001).

These  differences  in  the  frequencies  of  integration  strategies
could  be  due  to  differences  in  the  samples  of  the  two   studies.  How-
ever,  the  results  of  multiple  sub-sample  analyses  suggest  that  our
distribution  of  strategic  types  is  not  sample  dependent  (we  ran-
domly  created  subsamples  of  varying  sizes  and  then  classiﬁed  each
respondent  into  their  respective  arc).  A  more  likely  explanation  for
the  differences  may   be  a  progression  in  general  trends  related  to
supply  chain  integration  over  the  past  decade.  The  change  in  strat-
egy  frequencies  implied  in  our  data  may   suggest  that  in  the  decade

comparable  (81.9%  correctly  classiﬁed).  In  addition,  we  ran  discriminant  analyses
with  various  subsamples  of  our  data  including  subsamples  with  the  2007  and  2008
data   separately,  both  with  all  10  measurement  items  as  inputs  to  the  discrimi-
nant  analysis  and  with  the  two  factor  scores  as  inputs  in  separate  analyses.  The
results  were  again  consistent  with  above  assessment.  As  a  ﬁnal  robustness  check
we   repeated  the  discriminant  analysis  with  ﬁve  randomly  drawn  subsamples  of  200
observations  (about  half  of  the  dataset),  again  using  both  all  10  measurement  items
and   the  two   factor  scores  as  independent  variables  in  separate  analyses.  Correctly
classiﬁed  cases  ranged  from  78.5%  to  88.5%.  Overall,  these  results  support  the  relia-
bility  of  the  arcs  of  integration  framework  as  proposed  by  Frohlich  and  Westbrook
(2001);   it  is  reproducible  and  robust  to  sampling.

since  the  Frohlich  and  Westbrook’s  (2001)  study,  ﬁrms  have  recog-
nized  the  importance  to  integrate  both  upstream  and  downstream,
to  both  suppliers  and  customers.  The  more  myopic  “supplier-
facing”  and  “customer-facing”  strategies  have  apparently  become
less  prevalent  over  the  last  10  years.  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)
speculated  that  such  strategies  might  actually  represent  steps  in
an  evolution  toward  more  integrated  strategies.  Similarly,  ﬁrms
may   be  recognizing  that  pursuing  only  an  inward-facing  integration
strategy  is  insufﬁcient  in  today’s  world,  as  outsourcing  and  supply
chain  perspectives  have  become  more  pervasive  over  the  last  10
years.  In  contrast,  the  two   strategies  that  emphasize  both  upstream
and  downstream  integration  to  equal  degrees,  the  periphery-facing
and  outward  facing  arcs,  appear  to  be  more  prevalent  today  than
in  the  past.  This  trend  would  suggest  that  managers  are  adopting
more  overall  integrated  and  holistic  approaches  to  supply  chain
management.

4.2.  Rationalizing  the  classiﬁcation  scheme

Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  noted  that  the  majority  of  their
sample  fell  in  the  periphery-facing  group,  and  they  posed  the  ques-
tion  of  whether  “this  is  the  natural  point  of  equilibrium  in  terms  of
supply  chain  management.”  We   point  out  that  their  result  is  actu-
ally  a  mathematical  outcome  of  their  classiﬁcation  rules,  rather
than  a  propensity  for  strategic  choice  combinations.  Upon  closer
examination  of  the  rules  used  to  classify  respondents  into  the  ﬁve
integration  strategies,  one  recognizes  that  all  groups  do  not  have
an  equal  likelihood  of  membership.  The  probability  of  a  given  ﬁrm
falling  into  a  certain  arc  is  dependent  upon  how  correlated  the
ﬁrm’s  supplier  and  customer  integrations  are.  Table  5  provides  the
probabilities  of  class  membership  when  these  integration  strate-
gies  are  perfectly  uncorrelated,  perfectly  positively  correlated,  and
perfectly  negatively  correlated.  In  each  case  we   would  expect  about
50%  of  the  sample  to  fall  in  the  periphery-facing  group.  Equal  rep-
resentation  (i.e.  20%  membership  in  each  of  the  ﬁve  groups)  is

not  possible.  Thus,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the  results  suggest  the
periphery-facing  strategy  to  be  the  most  frequently  applied  strat-
egy.

We   note,  however,  that  this  does  not  invalidate  the  results
or  conclusions  drawn  by  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001).   Rather,
our  analysis  provides  for  a  more  rigorous  understanding  of  the
results.  One  has  to  determine  whether  a  strategy  group  is  over-
or  underrepresented  relative  to  the  expected  proportions,  rather
than  using  equal  proportions  as  a  baseline  for  comparison.  A  chi-
square  test  conﬁrmed  that  the  classiﬁcation  proportions  in  the
Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  data  are  signiﬁcantly  different  from
the  expected  proportions  for  uncorrelated  integration  scores  ((cid:2)2(4,
N  =  291)  =  50.890,  p  <  .001).  Thus,  rather  than  representing  a  “nat-
ural  point  of  equilibrium,”  the  frequency  of  the  periphery-facing
strategy  in  the  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  sample  is  actually
signiﬁcantly  lower  than  expected  (50%).  This  suggests  that  compa-
nies  in  their  sample  were  more  likely  to  pursue  other  strategies.
In  addition,  the  data  from  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  suggest
that  more  companies  than  expected  pursued  the  inward-facing  and
outward-facing  strategies,  whereas  fewer  ﬁrms  than  expected  pur-
sued  the  remaining  three  strategies  in  between  these  two   extremes.
Comparing  these  expected  proportions  (for  uncorrelated  inte-
gration  strategies)  to  the  counts  received  with  our  data  also
produces  a  signiﬁcant  chi-square  value  ((cid:2)2(4,  N  =  403)  =  76.610,
p  <  .001).  Our  data  are  suggestive  of  a  movement  toward  even
greater  levels  of  coordinated  integration  strategies  than  those
revealed  in  the  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  data.  Speciﬁcally,
in  our  data,  more  ﬁrms  than  expected  are  in  the  outward-facing
and  periphery-facing  groups,  whereas  fewer  ﬁrms  than  expected
are  in  the  supplier-facing  and  customer-facing  groups.

5.  The  link  to  performance,  and  the  moderating  role  of
internal  integration

5.1.  Validating  and  extending  the  link  to  performance

Similar  to  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001),   we   used  one-way
analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  to  analyse  differences  in  perfor-
mance  among  the  strategic  integration  groups.  ANCOVA  combines
features  of  analysis  of  variance  and  regression  (Hair  et  al.,  1996),
and  was  deemed  the  most  appropriate  analytical  approach  given
the  categorical  nature  of  the  arcs  of  integration.  Table  7  provides
the  results.  In  contrast  to  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001),   who   did
not  include  any  control  variables,  we  included  ﬁve  contingencies
in  the  analysis,  results  pertaining  to  which  are  presented  in  Section
5.3.

The  results  support  Hypothesis  1a–d,  indicating  that  greater
arcs  of  supplier  and  customer  integration  are  associated  with
greater  levels  of  (a)  quality,  (b)  delivery,  (c)  ﬂexibility  and  (d)

cost  performance.  In  general,  the  nominal  performance  scores
in  Table  7  increase  from  left  to  right,  moving  from  the  entirely
inward-facing  strategy  (low  supplier  and  customer  integration)
to  the  entirely  outward-facing  strategy  (high  supplier  and  cus-
tomer  integration).  Thus,  ﬁrms  that  reported  higher  levels  of
external  integration  also  tended  to  rate  themselves  as  top  perform-
ers  in  their  respective  industries  on  each  of  the  four  operational
dimensions.  Most  notably,  performance  scores  for  the  outward-
facing  ﬁrms  are  signiﬁcantly  higher  (p  <  .05)  than  those  for  the
inward-facing  and  periphery-facing  ﬁrms  for  every  performance
construct.  Reported  performance  scores  for  the  outward-facing
ﬁrms  are  signiﬁcantly  higher  than  those  of  customer-facing  ﬁrms
on  quality,  ﬂexibility  and  cost  performance,  and  they  are  signif-
icantly  higher  than  those  of  supplier-facing  ﬁrms  on  ﬂexibility
and  cost  performance.  In  addition,  inward-facing  ﬁrms  recorded
signiﬁcantly  lower  performance  than  periphery-facing  ﬁrms  on
delivery  and  cost  performance,  signiﬁcantly  lower  performance
than  supplier-facing  ﬁrms  on  quality,  delivery  and  cost  perfor-
mance,  and  signiﬁcantly  lower  performance  than  customer-facing
ﬁrms  on  the  delivery  and  cost  dimensions.  In  general,  the  results
suggest  that  a  combined  customer  and  supplier  integration  effort
(outward-facing)  yields  signiﬁcantly  superior  returns  over  a  more
myopic  or  less  intensive  integration  effort.

The  pattern  of  signiﬁcant  differences  among  the  ﬁve  groups
for  each  of  the  performance  models  is  more  pronounced  in  our
data  compared  to  the  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  sample.
Speciﬁcally,  in  the  original  study  the  outward-facing  group  was
differentiated  most  signiﬁcantly,  in  contrast  to  the  remaining  four
arcs,  which  did  not  differ  signiﬁcantly  among  each  other.  Our
data  indicate  both  the  inward-  and  the  outward-facing  groups  as
the  most  differentiated.  The  results  in  Table  7  show  a  signiﬁcant
improvement  in  performance  as  one  moves  from  the  former  group
to  the  latter.  This  pattern  may   indicate  that  ﬁrms  today  realize  sig-
niﬁcant  improvements  in  performance  even  from  small  integration
steps,  whereas  Frohlich  and  Westbrook’s  (2001)  results  suggested
that  signiﬁcant  performance  improvement  was  gained  only  when
ﬁrms  progressed  to  the  most  advanced  outward-facing  strategy.
Even  small-scale  integration  efforts  linked  to  beneﬁcial  efﬁcien-
cies  may   be  associated  with  better  mechanisms  and  approaches  for
integration  on  these  levels,  which  have  had  to  evolve  slowly  over
the  years.  Overall,  our  sample  data  provide  stronger  support  for  the
performance  impacts  of  a  comprehensive  integration  strategy  than
the  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)  sample  did,  as  differentiation
between  the  arcs’  scores  in  our  sample  is  even  more  pronounced
than  in  their  original  2001  study.

From  a  theory  building  perspective,  our  results  support  the
notion  that  integration  is  a  heterogeneous,  relational  resource  that
can  yield  competitive  differentiation.  The  ﬁndings  indicate  that
relational  rents  can  be  created  through  competent,  integrative

intensity.  The  speciﬁc  activities  inherent  in  external  integration
efforts  presumably  lead  to  unique  insights,  customized  routines
(e.g.,  communication  protocols)  and  knowledge  bases  that  are
able  to  positively  inﬂuence  operational  performance.  Our  ﬁndings
demonstrated  the  impact  on  quality,  delivery,  ﬂexibility  and  cost
performance.  These  ﬁndings  serve  to  validate  the  results  of  Frohlich
and  Westbrook  (2001),   and  provide  support  for  our  theoretical
rationales  grounded  in  the  RBV  and  the  relational  view.

5.2.  Testing  the  moderating  role  of  internal  integration

To  test  our  second  hypothesis  we  included  in  the  ANCOVAs  an
interaction  term  between  arcs  of  integration  (external  integration
strategy)  and  internal  integration  (Baron  and  Kenny,  1986).  Our
initial  analysis  using  two  levels  of  internal  integration  and  ﬁve  lev-
els  of  external  “arcs  of  integration”  yielded  inconclusive  results.
An  examination  of  the  mean  score  plots  visually  indicated  that  an
interaction  was  present.  However,  the  sample  sizes  in  some  groups
were  quite  low,  as  we  were  dividing  the  overall  sample  into  ten
different  groups  (two  internal  integration  groups ×  ﬁve  arcs  of  inte-
gration  groups).  As  a  result,  many  of  the  interaction  terms  were  not
statistically  signiﬁcant.  The  results  were  also  difﬁcult  to  interpret  in
some  cases  as  we  had  no  theory  to  guide  our  expectations  regard-
ing  an  interaction  between  internal  integration  and  each  speciﬁc
arc  of  external  integration.

To  deal  with  the  sample  size  problem  we  combined  ﬁrms  that
were  in  the  inward-facing  and  periphery-facing  groups,  classifying
them  with  the  title  “low  external  integration”.  Likewise  we   com-
bined  the  ﬁrms  that  were  in  the  customer-facing,  supplier-facing,
and  outward-facing  groups,  classifying  them  with  the  title  “high
external  integration”.  This  dichotomization  made  sense  theoreti-
cally  based  on  how  each  of  these  arcs  was  conceptualized.  It  was
also  beneﬁcial  from  a  practical  perspective  in  that  the  more  parsi-
monious  treatment  provides  a  clearer  interpretation  of  the  ﬁndings
(cf.  Devaraj  et  al.,  2007;  Flynn  et  al.,  2010).  ANCOVAs  were  con-
ducted  to  examine  the  main  and  interaction  effects  of  high  and
low  levels  of  internal  and  external  integration.  Table  8  presents  the
results,  including  the  performance  means  for  the  four  groups.

The  results  support  hypothesis  2b  and  c,  i.e.  the  relationship
between  external  integration  strategy  and  performance  is  moder-
ated  by  internal  integration,  for  both  the  delivery  and  ﬂexibility
dimensions  of  performance.  However,  the  moderating  effect  is  not
demonstrated  for  either  quality  or  cost  performance,  offering  no
support  for  hypothesis  2a  and  d.  The  mean  score  plots  for  these
four  models  in  Fig.  1  visually  conﬁrm  these  results.  The  plots  indi-
cate  that  external  integration  has  enhanced  signiﬁcant  positive
effects  on  both  delivery  and  ﬂexibility  performance  when  internal

integration  is  higher  than  average.  Thus,  internal  integration  can
be  considered  to  be  an  important  complement  to  external  inte-
gration  in  enhancing  a  ﬁrm’s  delivery  and  ﬂexibility  performance.
An  IPT-based  interpretation  of  the  ﬁndings  is  that  internal  inte-
gration  activities  help  the  ﬁrm  to  absorb  and  apply  knowledge
generated  from  customer  and  supplier  integration  efforts,  such  that
the  beneﬁts  of  such  knowledge  are  more  fully  realized  among  the
dimensions  of  delivery  and  ﬂexibility.

The  non-signiﬁcant  interaction  terms  for  quality  and  cost  per-
formance  suggest  that  the  knowledge  gained  through  external
integration  efforts  creates  beneﬁts  for  these  outcomes  in  ways  that
are  independent  from  internal  integration  efforts.  We   posit  that
knowledge  ﬂows  from  external  and  internal  integration  efforts  may
follow  separate  pathways  to  different  knowledge  users  for  differ-
ent  dimensions  of  performance.  Decisions  affecting  product  quality
and  cost  are  heavily  inﬂuenced  by  product  designers  who  are
typically  somewhat  isolated  from  supply  chain  functional  organiza-
tions  (cf.  Ragatz  et  al.,  2002).  Strategic  product-process  integration
(Swink  et  al.,  2007)  would  provide  the  vertical  pathways  important
for  helping  designers  to  absorb  and  apply  knowledge  from  exter-
nal  supply  chain  integration,  rather  than  the  horizontal  pathways
offered  by  internal  supply  chain  functional  integration.

On  the  other  hand,  process  improvements  applied  to  areas
of  delivery  and  ﬂexibility  are  more  likely  to  be  accomplished
through  the  integrated  efforts  of  internal  supply  chain  functions,
and  are  likely  to  beneﬁt  also  from  short-term  interactions  asso-
ciated  with  integration  activities.  Thus,  whereas  product-related
knowledge  ﬂows  (pertaining  to  quality  and  cost)  generated  by
internal  and  external  integration  efforts  may   follow  independent
paths  to  product  designers,  applications  of  process-related  knowl-
edge  (pertaining  to  delivery  and  ﬂexibility)  gained  from  customer
and  supplier  integration  efforts  appear  to  depend  upon  the  infor-
mation  processing  capabilities  provided  by  internal  integration
routines.  When  these  internal  integration  capabilities  are  present,
the  evidence  suggests  that  a  ﬁrm  will  reap  greater  beneﬁts  from
external  integration  activities  in  terms  of  delivery  and  ﬂexibility
performance.

Furthermore,  delivery  and  ﬂexibility  performance  are  both
time-related;  thus  they  rely  more  heavily  on  the  swift  and  even
ﬂow  of  information  and  products  through  the  supply  chain,  requir-
ing  to  a  greater  degree  the  existence  of  appropriate  structures  for
effective  and  efﬁcient  information  processing  (i.e.  internal  integra-
tion)  (Schmenner  and  Swink,  1998).  Accordingly,  it  makes  sense
that  the  relationships  between  external  integration  and  both  deliv-
ery  and  ﬂexibility  performance  are  more  likely  to  be  strengthened
in  the  presence  of  internal  integration.  Internal  integration  pro-
vides  a  means  to  communicate  insight  derived  from  external

integration  to  most  effectively  inﬂuence  the  time-based  outcomes.
The  just-in-time  environment  provides  a  case  in  point.  In  contrast,
quality  and  cost  performance,  which  have  been  described  as  less
time-sensitive  (Wong  et  al.,  2011)  and  less  susceptible  to  external
inputs  (Ragatz  et  al.,  2002),  may   be  less  dependent  on  internal  inte-
gration  facilitating  the  inﬂuence  of  external  integration  (Eisenhardt
and  Tabrizi,  1995).

We   note  that  the  main  effects  of  external  integration  on  qual-
ity  and  delivery  performance  are  both  non-signiﬁcant.  Neither  of
these  ﬁndings  invalidates  our  support  for  H1,  but  they  do  point
to  the  added  discrimination  and  insight  provided  by  Frohlich
and  Westbrook’s  (2001)  ﬁve-category  classiﬁcation  scheme.  Some
of  the  differences  between  outward-facing  and  more  myopic
customer-  or  supplier-facing  strategies  are  hidden  in  this  aggre-
gated  analysis.

Several  important  implications  emerge  from  our  ﬁndings.  Over-
all,  our  data  illustrate  the  beneﬁts  of  internal  integration,  as
it  enables  and  reinforces  the  beneﬁts  of  external 
integration
strategies  on  select  performance  measures.  This  again  nicely  illus-
trates  the  notion  of  the  supply  chain.  While  Frohlich  and  Westbrook

(2001)  brought  attention  to  the  need  to  integrate  with  both  cus-
tomers  and  suppliers,  we  show  that  the  internal  aspects  of  supply
chain  management  should  not  be  neglected.  Supply  chain  man-
agement  excellence  involves  the  swift,  even  ﬂow  of  materials  and
information  throughout  the  entire  network,  including  the  ﬁrm’s
internal  operations.  Our  results  also  point  to  the  fact  that  non-time-
based  performance  (quality  and  cost)  does  not  appear  to  depend
upon  the  internal  infrastructure  to  transform  the  beneﬁts  derived
from  external  integration.

From  a  theory-based  perspective,  our  study  once  again  points
to  the  power  of  the  information  processing  theoretic  argument  in
explaining  why  and  how  a  certain  strategic  initiative  is  more  or  less
successful.  Because  integration  is  an  information  intensive  process,
it  makes  perfect  sense  to  view  internal  and  external  integration
activities  as  complements  to  one  another.  Internal  integration  can
therefore  be  seen  as  an  important  enabler  of  full  supply  chain  inte-
gration.  While  ﬁrms  that  are  poorly  integrated  internally  may   reap
some  beneﬁts  from  external  supply  chain  integration,  the  poten-
tial,  especially  in  terms  of  delivery  and  ﬂexibility  performance,  is
much  enhanced  with  sound  internal  integration  in  place.

5.3.  Robustness  check

We  conducted  several  robustness  checks  to  assess  the  reliabil-
ity  and  generalizability  of  our  ﬁndings.  To  do  so  we  repeated  the
ANCOVAs  described  above,  but  added  respective  interaction  effects.
We  ﬁrst  tested  whether  the  ﬁrm’s  location  in  the  supply  chain  had
any  signiﬁcant  effect  on  the  results  by  dividing  the  sample  into
manufacturing-oriented  and  non-manufacturing-oriented  (distri-
bution  and/or  retail)  ﬁrms,  with  the  latter  subset  representing  ﬁrms
located  more  downstream  in  the  supply  chain.  None  of  the  twelve
interaction  tests  were  signiﬁcant  at  the  .05  signiﬁcance  level,  sug-
gesting  that  the  ﬁrm’s  position  in  the  supply  chain  does  not  affect
the  results.  We   conducted  similar  robustness  checks  to  evaluate
whether  the  results  are  invariant  across  subsamples  deﬁned  by
time  (survey  year),  respondent  ﬁrm  location  (North  America  or
non-North  America),  and  ﬁrm  size.  Only  one  interaction  term  was
signiﬁcant  in  each  of  the  three  sets  of  models  (over  36  tests  in  all),
indicating  that  our  ﬁndings  are  also  robust  to  sampling  time  frame,
the  ﬁrm’s  geographical  location,  and  its  size.

6.  Conclusions

Because  theory  surrounding  supply  chain  integration  is  still
underdeveloped,  we  deemed  it  crucial  to  revisit  Frohlich  and
Westbrook’s  (2001)  conceptualizations  and  results.  As  such,  our
paper  offers  reﬁnements  on  what  may   be  called  a  theory  of  inte-
gration,  i.e.  a  conﬁrmation  of  the  signiﬁcant  beneﬁts  that  ﬁrms
can  realize  by  being  strategically  interconnected  and  aligned  with
their  supply  chain  partners.  We   have  ﬁrmly  grounded  this  theory
in  two  well-known  perspectives,  the  RBV  combined  with  the  rela-
tional  view,  and  information  processing  theory.  As  we   have  shown,
the  combination  of  these  two  perspectives  provides  a  useful  foun-
dation  for  explaining  the  effects  of  supply  chain  integration  on
performance.  The  RBV  explains  why  external  integration  should  be
expected  to  enhance  performance,  while  information  processing
theory  explains  how  internal  integration  can  make  external  inte-
gration  more  beneﬁcial.

Our  study  further  empirically  corroborates  the  arcs  of  integra-
tion  concept,  and  thus  contributes  to  the  integrity  of  research  and
further  theory  development.  We   validated  the  ﬁndings  in  a  dif-
ferent  context,  and  ascertained  the  concept’s  predictive  validity
and  generalizability,  thereby  addressing  calls  for  further  research
issued  by  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001).   By  means  of  compar-
ison,  our  study  also  provides  insight  into  the  changing  levels  of
integration  in  business  ﬁrms,  and  offers  a  rationalization  of  the
classiﬁcation  scheme  utilized  in  the  original  study.

Our  results  conﬁrm  that  closer  integration  with  both  customers
and  suppliers  yields  enhanced  performance  over  more  myopic
or  non-integrated  approaches.  The  ﬁndings  suggest  that  sup-
ply  chain  integration  can  lead  to  the  internalizing  of  resources
from  outside  partners,  such  as  supplier  capabilities  or  customer

market  insights.  The  results  also  bring  further  clarity  to  inconsis-
tent  ﬁndings  reported  in  prior  studies,  and  conﬁrm  the  link  to  four
operational  performance  dimensions.

Applying  IPT,  we   elucidated  the  moderating  effect  of  internal
integration  on  the  relationship  between  external  integration  and
performance,  proposing  a  more  reﬁned  role  of  internal  integration.
The  results  suggest  that  an  information  processing  infrastructure
is  needed  to  effectively  and  efﬁciently  process  knowledge  gained
from  external  sources  for  the  beneﬁt  of  delivery  and  ﬂexibility.
However,  effects  on  quality  and  cost  performance  are  not  enhanced
via  internal  integration.  This  ﬁnding  may   be  indicative  of  differ-
ences  in  speciﬁc  knowledge  pathways  within  the  ﬁrm  and  their
associated  susceptibilities  to  external  inputs.  We   leave  it  to  future
research  to  further  investigate  these  possibilities.

Our  ﬁndings  reiterate  Frohlich  and  Westbrook’s  (2001)  argu-
ment  that  managers  should  pursue  both  customer  and  supplier
integration  in  an  integrated  fashion.  This  may   require  a  shift  in
responsibilities,  so  that  the  supply  management  function  obtains
visibility  not  only  for  its  suppliers,  but  also  for  its  customers.  The
reverse  applies  for  marketing  and  sales  management  functions.  We
extended  this  notion  by  conﬁrming  the  direct  and  moderating  roles
of  internal  integration.  Managers  should  thus  seek  ways  to  use
internal  integration  capabilities  to  leverage  supplier  and  customer
relationships  for  improved  delivery  and  ﬂexibility  performance.

Opportunities  to  extend  our  ﬁndings  and  address  their  limi-
tations  provide  promising  avenues  for  future  research.  Potential
antecedents  and  contingencies  to  supply  chain  integration  should
be  examined.  For  example,  neither  Frohlich  and  Westbrook  (2001)
nor  our  study  directly  addressed  the  issue  of  culture.  While  our
analysis  of  regional  differences  showed  no  signiﬁcant  effects,  future
research  might  further  investigate  such  potential  impact.  Our  study
speciﬁcally  addressed  the  issue  of  generalizability  by  replicating
an  original  study.  However,  further  investigation  might  assess
whether  the  results  hold  in  different  settings.  For  example,  our
data  suggest  that  respondents  considered  themselves  to  be  above
average  performers  in  some  dimensions.  Against  this  background,
future  studies  might  evaluate  the  effects  of  performance  bias.  In
addition,  we   have  ignored  possible  contingency  effects  such  as
environmental  uncertainty  (Koufteros  et  al.,  2005;  Wong  et  al.,
2011);  this  too  could  be  considered  in  future  research.

Different  models  and  operationalizations  of  integration  present
other  research  opportunities.  As  such,  future  studies  could  incor-
porate  all  three  dimensions  of  integration  into  an  overall  supply
chain  arc  of  integration  taxonomy,  similar  as  in  Flynn  et  al.  (2010).
Further  studies  should  also  aim  to  collect  dyadic  or  even  triadic
integration  measures;  our  study  was  limited  to  data  provided  by
single  respondents.  In  addition,  while  most  integration  research
has  focused  on  the  positive  effects,  studies  also  need  to  address  the
costs  associated  with  integration  efforts.

Major  thrust  of  study 

Major  ﬁndings

Examination  of  the  impact  of
supply  chain  integration  and
socialization  on  the  supplier’s
operational  and
communication  performance,
with  the  ultimate  impact  on
the  buyer’s  perception  of  the
supplier’s  contractual
performance.
Examination  of  speciﬁc
conﬁgurations  of  supplier
integration  practices,  which
can  be  classiﬁed  into  external
and  internal  integration
practices;  examination  of  the
inﬂuence  of  practices
conﬁguration  on
performance.
Examination  of  the  inﬂuence
of  e-business  capabilities  on
customer  and  supplier
integration,  with  the  ultimate
impact  on  operational
performance.
Relationship  between
individual  integration
dimensions  and  their
interactions  on  performance;
the  inﬂuence  of  integration
patterns  on  performance.

Examination  of  the  effects  of
internal  integration  and
downstream  integration  on
logistical  performance  and
ultimately  ﬁnancial
performance;  investigation  of
the  moderating  effect  of
internal  integration.

Linking  supply  market
intelligence  and  supply
management  inﬂuence  with
cross-enterprise  integration
and  supplier  integration;
examining  their  relationship
to  sourcing  enterprise
performance  and  the
ultimate  impact  on  buyer
ﬁnancial  performance.
Examination  of  the
antecedents  to  gray-box  and
black-box  integration  and
their  inﬂuence  on  product
innovation.

Relationship  between
internal  integration,
customer  integration,
supplier  product  integration,
and  supplier  process
integration  on  glitches,
on-time  execution  of
engineering  change  orders,
and  market  success.

Supply  chain  integration  only
positively  inﬂuences  the
supplier’s  communication
performance,  but  not  the
supplier’s  operational
performance.

There  exists  an  optimal  set  of
supplier  integration
practices;  departures  from  it
lead  to  a  deterioration  in
performance.

Supplier  integration
positively  inﬂuences
performance,  while  the
inﬂuence  of  customer
integration  on  performance  is
non-signiﬁcant.
Supply  chain  integration  is
related  to  both  operational
and  business  performance;
internal  and  customer
integration  are  more  strongly
related  to  performance  than
supplier  integration.
Both  internal  and
downstream  integration
positively  inﬂuence  logistical
performance;  the
relationship  between
downstream  integration  and
logistical  performance  is
moderated  by  internal
integration;  the  relationship
between  logistical
performance  and  ﬁnancial
performance  is  supported.
Entrepreneurial  behaviors
(supply  market  intelligence
and  supply  management
inﬂuence)  are  related  to
cross-enterprise  and  supplier
integration,  which  both  have
a  positive  inﬂuence  on
performance  improvement.

Only  gray-box  integration
positively  inﬂuences  product
innovation;  the  inﬂuence  of
black-box  integration  on
product  innovation  is
negligible.
Internal  integration
inﬂuences  customer
integration,  supplier  product
integration  and  supplier
process  integration;  customer
integration  inﬂuences  market
success,  and  supplier  product
and  supplier  process
integration  inﬂuence  glitches
and  on-time  execution  of
engineering  change  orders.

Development  of  a
theory  of  supply
chain  integration

Relationship  between
individual  integration
dimensions  and
performance;  environmental
uncertainty  as  a  moderator  to
the  relationship  between
integration  and  performance.

Linking  internal  integration,
relationship  commitment  to
customers  and  relationship
commitment  to  suppliers
with  customer  and
supplier  integration;
examination  of  the
moderating  role  of
ownership,  industry  and
region.

Internal  and  external
integration  are  related  to
product  innovation,  quality
and  proﬁtability;  equivocality
moderates  the  link  between
integration  and  performance.

Product  co-development
inﬂuences  product
modularity  and  product
performance,  and
organizational  coordination
inﬂuences  product
modularity;  no  support  was
found  for  the  remaining  links
between  supply  chain
integration  and  the  two
performance  measures.
Product-process  technology
integration  and  supply  chain
integration  are
complementary  in  achieving
quality,  delivery,  and  process
ﬂexibility;  product-process
technology  integration  and
customer  integration  are
complementary  in  achieving
quality  and  new  product
ﬂexibility.
Each  of  the  four  integration
types  is  likely  to  result  in
beneﬁts  related  to
manufacturing  competitive
capabilities,  market
performance,  or  customer
satisfaction;  however,  all  but
corporate  strategy
integration  also  involve
potential  costs  to  either
market  performance  or
product  quality.
Environmental  uncertainty
moderates  the  relationship
between  internal  integration
and  cost  and  quality
performance,  between
supplier  integration  and
delivery  and  ﬂexibility
performance,  and  between
customer  integration  and
ﬂexibility  performance.
Relationship  commitment  to
customers  inﬂuences
customer  integration,  and
relationship  commitment  to
suppliers  inﬂuences  supplier
integration;  internal
integration  inﬂuences  both
customer  and  supplier
integration;  differences
between  regions  and
industries  were  also  detected.
