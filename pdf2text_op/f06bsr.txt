Work and Workplace Attitudes 

on Social Workers: Do They 

Predict Organizational 

Reputation?

ANAT FREUND

W

elfare services have been perceived for a long time as pro-
viding “poor service for poor people.” This kind of thinking
reﬂects the common perceptions and attitudes of social
workers, clients, and society toward social services (Boehm, 2002).
The above statement means that social services are politically, eco-
nomically, and socially weak, and that the designated population
is also weak. Nevertheless, social services are manned by professional
social workers who have had extensive professional training, both
academic and nonacademic, and who possess a uniﬁed professional
identity and ethics. The organization’s reputation is signiﬁcant
to  these  professional  workers,  and  therefore  it  is  interesting  to
consider their perception of it. This factor has a signiﬁcant impact
on their functioning in terms of their ability to provide useful and
professional welfare services to clients (Kumar, 2004).

In the last several years, welfare organizations have shifted from
traditional management and a secure feeling of overall immunity, to
a competitive environment. This change has obviated job security:
personal  contracts  have  begun  replacing  tenured  positions,  and
social  workers  tend  to  shift  between  organizations.  At  the  same
time, the demands of the job are increasing; thus, social workers
are more frequently required to take an active part in fund-raising,

to help balance or even augment their organization’s budget. This
rapid change in the organizational environment has left social ser-
vice workers confronting increasingly complex professional challenges,
to which they must ﬁnd adequate responses if they are to remain
successful  in  their  ﬁeld.  Within  the  context  of  this  altered  work
environment, organizational reputation plays an important role.

Considerable research has been devoted to the subject of organi-
zational reputation as well as to work and workplace attitudes. Theore-
ticians  as  well  as  practitioners  dedicate  considerable  exploratory
efforts to identify the factors that promote a positive organizational
reputation and to investigate its implications. According to Fombrun
(1996:  57),  “corporate  reputations  are  held  by  people  inside  and
outside a company.” Companies consistently compete to be better
regarded, a status that reﬂects a competitive advantage and, more
likely, superior performance. Fombrun (1996: 9) argued that the
better-regarded  companies  build  their  reputation  by  developing
both economic and social practices. Although it is not entirely clear
whether organizational reputation is the predictor or the outcome of
high-level  performance,  a  review  of  the  literature  indicates  that
much effort has been devoted to study organizational reputation as
a predictor of a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance and stock market value
(Hammond  and  Slocum,  Jr.,  1996;  McGuire,  Sundgren  and
Schneewiess, 1988; Mcmillan and Joshi, 1997; Roberts and Dowling,
1997; Srivastava, McInish, Wood and Capraro, 1997; Vergin and
Qoronﬂeh, 1998).

Our  study,  compared  to  those  conducted  to  date,  extends  the
research on this subject in two main ways. First, while previous
studies  addressed  organizational  reputation  as  a  predictor  of  a
ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance and stock market value, in the context
of  our  research,  which  focuses  speciﬁcally  on  welfare  service
organizations, the ﬁscal value of the organization is less pertinent.
However, we explore the possibility that organizational reputation
can serve as a measure to assess quality performance in welfare
organizations. A second change introduced in our study relates to
how the term 
 is applied. Previous studies
engaged  the  term  organizational  reputation  to  refer  to  outsiders’
beliefs  about  an  organization’s  distinctive  attributes,  whereas  in
this study we employ the term organizational reputation to explore
how social workers, i.e., people inside the organization, view their
organization’s reputation. We believe that by using organizational

organizational reputation

reputation to reﬂect the workers’ image of the organization, the con-
cept can be harnessed as a tool for assessing (and later addressing)
employees’ work-related attitudes. To date, relatively few research
efforts have been allocated to explore work and workplace attitudes
and  their  empirical  association  with  organizational  reputation  in
social welfare organizations. In an exception, a study conducted by
Jones (1996) examined the determinants of reputation as perceived
by the employees of ten science-based ﬁrms. The results indicated
that  an  innovative  climate  and  job  satisfaction  were  the  major
determinants  of  reputation.  However,  while  the  study  of  Jones
(1996) focused on organizational reputation as perceived only by
human resource workers in industrial ﬁrms, our study examines
organizational reputation as perceived by social workers in welfare
organizations.

The subject of organizational reputation in welfare organizations
from one side and work attitudes within social workers and welfare
organizations from the other side is a subject that is researched in
Israel as well as in the rest of the western world, like England, for
example. Work attitudes of welfare workers with the elders (Boots,
Bilson, and Fowell, 1990), satisfaction and service quality (Redfern,
Hannan,  Norman,  and  Martin,  2002),  or  effectiveness  of  welfare
organizations (Cropanzano, James, and Konovsky, 1993) were all
investigated and raised interest. This research meant to relight the
point of organizational reputation in order to offer another perspec-
tive to look at those organizations.

The  goal  of  this  paper  is  to  present  the  ﬁndings  in  relation  to
existing  theoretical  and  empirical  research.  The  paper  concludes
with  suggestions  for  further  investigation  of  the  relationship
between  social  workers’  work  and  workplace  attitudes  and  their
perception of the organizational reputation of their workplace.

THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND RESEARCH 

HYPOTHESES

Organizational Reputation

The concept of organizational reputation is of increasing interest to
researchers and practitioners and especially for researchers in social
welfare organizations. This interest is grounded in a resource-based


 

 
 

 

70

BUSINESS AND SOCIETY REVIEW

view of the ﬁrm, according to which gaining a competitive advan-
tage  depends  on  the  bundle  of  core  resources  that  a  ﬁrm  has
developed, acquired, and deployed in the arena (Aaker, 1989; Amit
and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991, 1995; Grant, 1991; Wernerfelt,
1984). Reputation is considered a strategic resource. Having a good
reputation means being more attractive than others in the eyes of
the ﬁrm’s constituencies, who decide to enter a contract based on
an  assessment  of  the  ﬁrm’s  reputation  (Clark  and  Montgomery,
1998; Fombrun, 1996; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Weigelt and
Camerer, 1988). As a core resource, reputation can be a major factor
in gaining a competitive advantage and fortifying the organization’s
ﬁnancial  position,  insofar  as  the  competitors  ﬁnd  it  difﬁcult  to
match  the  degree  of  fame  and  esteem  (Hall,  1992:  138).  Teece,
Pisano,  and  Shuen  (1997:  521)  have  clearly  demonstrated  that
reputation functions as a core resource. Reputation is an intangible
asset,  representing  a  kind  of  summary  statistic  about  the  ﬁrm’s
current assets, its position, and its likely future behavior (Freund,
2005b).

Hence, organizational reputation is not only an issue of economic
effectiveness, but also of noneconomic effectiveness, that is, socio-
logical signiﬁcance (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990: 234). In the current
study,  as  in  previous  works  (e.g.,  Fombrun  and  Shanely,  1990;
Fryxell and Wang, 1994), we used 
’s deﬁnition of
corporate reputation, which consists of items that measure various
aspects  of  corporate  social  responsibility,  innovativeness,  and
quality of management.

Fortune Magazine

As  mentioned,  a  large  body  of  study  has  accumulated  on  the
issue of organizational reputation. However, there were almost no
studies testing organizational reputation in welfare organizations,
despite the important effects that organizational reputation has on
organizational results. This paucity is surprising, given that pro-
fessional standards require a systematic review of organizational
output and implementation of advanced management. To this end,
welfare organizations are expected to improve their organizational
reputation,  in  accord  with  the  belief  that  this  would  heighten
workers’ as well as clients’ appreciation of the organization, and that
later it would lead to the enhanced organizational success desired.
It may be assumed that organizational reputation is based on the
environment perspective of the organization. In cases in which the
environment supports the organization, his reputation will rise. But

this research, not like the others, asks the employed and not the
environment (Carmeli and Freund, 2004). So, it may be assumed
that  the  workers  ﬁlling  toward  his  occupation,  the  character  in
which he sees the professionalism of the crew and his supervisors
and of course his perspective of clients and colleagues outside the
organization  will  inﬂuence  his  attitude  toward  his  organization’s
reputation. So this research checks the workers’ attitude toward
their work in order to show a different angle of the reputation (Red-
fern, et al., 2002).

Workplace Attitudes: Affective and Continuance 
Organizational Commitment

The concept of organizational commitment is very dominant in the
research literature. In this, as in previous studies (e.g., Finegan,
2000; O’Driscoll and Randall, 1999), organizational commitment
is  deﬁned  as  the  employees’  attachment  to  the  organization,
demonstrated by their acceptance of the organization’s values and
goals, and a deﬁnite desire to maintain their membership in the
organization (Porter, Steers, Mowday, and Boulian, 1974: 604). Yet
this  construct  is  complex  and  multifaceted,  and  scholars  have
been deﬁning and operationalizing it in various ways. As a result, a
difﬁculty  in  synthesizing  the  accumulated  ﬁndings  has  been
revealed (Meyer, Allen, and Smith, 1993).

Recent  studies  have  highlighted  the  importance  of  exploring
how different forms of work commitment interrelate (Cohen, 1999;
Morrow, 1993), and how they are associated with work outcomes
(Freund and Carmeli, 2003). The rationale behind these and other
studies (Becker, 1992) is that “by failing to consider the larger
web of relationships encompassing the various work commitment
constructs, researchers may incorrectly identify the strength and
direction  of  the  relationship  between  these  constructs”  (Freund,
2005a).

Various studies have suggested that organizational commitment
is  associated  with  work  attitudes  and  outcomes  as  well  as  with
organizational  outcomes  (Carmeli  and  Freund,  2004).  Organiza-
tional  reputation  was  found  to  be  associated  with  organizational
identiﬁcation, the relationship between organizational commitment
and organizational reputation in social welfare organizations has
not yet been explored. However, since organizational reputation is


 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

72

basically  an  output  resource,  most  likely  it  is  associated  with
organizational  effectiveness  (see  the  cases  of  Port  Authority  and
Exxon in Dutton, Dukerich and Harquail, 1994). Given the work
reported by Angle and Perry (1981), which shows that organiza-
tional commitment is associated with organizational effectiveness,
it is most logical to expect an inﬂuence of organizational commi-
tment on organizational reputation. Based on the difference between
)
affective commitment (an employee remains because he 
wants to
and continuance commitment (an employee remains because he
needs to

), the following hypotheses are proposed:

Hypothesis  1a.  Affective  commitment  is  positively  associated

with organizational reputation.

Hypothesis 1b. Organizational reputation has a stronger associa-
tion with affective commitment than with continuance commitment.

WORK ATTITUDES

Organizational Citizenship Behavior

Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is an extra-role behavior
that  goes  beyond  formal  role  requirements  (Organ,  1988;  Smith,
Organ,  and  Near,  1983).  Different  approaches  for  understanding
OCB suggest that this variable is multidimensional. In general, the
term OCB refers to two major tendencies: one is a behavior directed
toward a certain person in the organization, as in supporting and
assisting  another  team  member  or  helping  a  new  worker.  This
tendency, described as behavior directed toward other workers
in the organization, has been termed OCB altruism (Carmeli and
Freund,  2004).  The  other  tendency  of  this  behavior  is  directed
toward the organization as a whole, rather than speciﬁcally toward
one person. Examples of this would include a very high work ethic
beyond the formal expectations, very few days missed at work, etc.
This tendency to exhibit good citizenship behavior toward the whole
organization is called OCB compliance (Organ and Paine, 1999).

The current study has chosen to use the two OCB components; that is,
the dependent variable in the current study includes two parts: altru-
istic OCB and OCB compliance. Hence, both parts of the variable will be
discussed as one unit in the Findings and Discussion sections. We expect
that OCB will be positively related to organizational reputation.

Hypothesis  2.  Organizational  citizenship  behavior  is  positively

associated with organizational reputation.

Job Performance

The current study relates to job performance as the key measure
among  organizational  performances  (Freund,  2005b).  For  an
organization to achieve its goals, an evaluation of its organizational
performance  is  required.  This  includes  several  components:  the
ability  to  practically  achieve  organizational  goals,  to  produce
quality work at high organizational levels, and to keep up with
the schedule determined by the organization (Joe, 1996). Par-
ticularly  signiﬁcant  among  the  major  measures  of  organizational
performance is the employees’ ability to assess their own personal
performance.  The  job  performance  model  was  found  to  be  the
most  adequate  for  measuring  the  organizational  performance  of
social workers (Sum, 1998).

Hypothesis 3. Social workers’ job performance is positively correla-

ted with organizational reputation.

METHOD

Participants

The target population of this study was 600 social workers work-
ing  in  welfare  organizations  in  Israel.  All  the  employees  of  this
umbrella organization were asked to participate in the study.
All  600  employees  received  the  questionnaire,  and  515  of  the
employees  returned  usable  questionnaires,  rendering  a  response
rate  of  85  percent.  Of  515  social  workers,  86.8  percent  were
women,  the  average  age  of  respondents  was  36.8  years,  and
69.4  percent  were  married.  Rank  distribution:  4.6  percent  held
managerial  positions,  16.8  percent  of  respondents  worked  as
team  leaders,  and  78.6  percent  were  regular  employees.  Mean
tenure  in  the  organization  was  6.6  years;  64.1  percent  were
employed via a permanent contract; 51.2 percent of the respon-
dents held full-time positions. Educational proﬁle was as follows:
67.8 percent of the respondents held a B.A degree and 32.2 percent
an M.A. degree.

Measures

BUSINESS AND SOCIETY REVIEW

Research Tools. 

The major tool used in this study was the closed,
self-reporting questionnaire, in which all items sampled are mea-
sured on a seven-point scale, ranging from 1 = “strongly disagree,”
to 7 = “strongly agree.” All variables underwent a series of validation
and standardization processes, as recommended in the literature.
In addition, a paper explaining the importance of the study’s con-
tribution to the ﬁeld of social work was delivered.

Workplace Attitudes

Affective and Continuance Organizational Commitment. 

A  dual
component concept of organizational commitment was included in
this  study:  continuance  commitment  and  affective  commitment.
Continuance commitment is deﬁned as “the extent to which em-
ployees  feel  committed  to  their  organizations  by  virtue  of  the
costs that they feel are associated with leaving” (Meyer and Allen,
1984, p. 375). Affective commitment is deﬁned as “positive feelings
of  identiﬁcation  with,  attachment  to,  and  involvement  in  the
work organization” (Meyer and Allen, 1984, p. 375). Thus, employees
with a strong affective commitment remain because they want to,
and  those  with  strong  continuance  commitment  remain  because
they need to (Allen and Meyer, 1990). The measures of organiza-
tional  commitment  used  for  continuance  commitment  (eight

items) (
 = 0.86)
 = 0.81) and for affective commitment (eight items) (
were based on those developed by Allen and Meyer (1990).

Work Attitudes

Organizational Citizenship Behavior. 

A dual component concept
of organizational citizenship behavior was included in this study:
 =
compliance and altruism. OCB was measured using 14 items (
0.75) from the overall OCB measure developed by Smith, Organ, and
Near (1983), which has been adopted also in previous works (e.g.,
Organ and Ryan, 1995). Compliance behavior was measured using
six items, such as: “takes undeserved breaks” (reversed scoring),
and “attendance at work is above the norm.” Altruistic behavior was
measured using eight items, such as: “helps others who have been
absent” and “makes innovative suggestions to improve department.”

Job  Performance. 

This  variable  was  evaluated  by  a  measure
developed by Pearce and Porter (1986), and used by Black and Porter
α
(1991). The scale include 10 items, (
 = 0.93). One sample item is:
“my ability to get along with others.”

Organizational Reputation

Fortune  Magazine

This  measure  is  based  on 
’s  annual  survey  of
America’s most admired corporations, which has been published
since  the  year  1982.  This  corporate  reputation  survey  is  con-
ducted  annually  among  8,000  top  executives,  outside  directors,
and  ﬁnancial  analysts,  who  are  asked  to  rate  the  ten  largest
companies in their own industry on eight attributes, using a scale
of 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent). The attributes are: quality of man-
agement; quality of products or services; innovativeness; long-term
investment value; ﬁnancial soundness; ability to attract, develop,
and  retain  talented  people;  community  and  environmental
responsibility;  and  use  of  corporate  assets  (e.g.,  Smith,  1990).
This  measure  has  been  used  by  numerous  scholars,  including
Fombrun  and  Shanley  (1990),  Fryxell  and  Wang  (1994),  and
McGuire,  Sundgren,  and  Schneeweiss  (1988).  Some  have  used
this scale to measure overall corporate reputation (e.g., Fombrun
and Shanley, 1990; Fryxell and Wang, 1994), while others have
limited the use to components, most commonly that of corporate
social  responsibility  (e.g.,  Deephouse,  2000;  Hammond  and
Slocum, Jr., 1996; McGuire, Sundgren, and Schneeweiss, 1988).
The scale include 10 items, (
 = 0.78). One sample item is: “In
my  organization,  management  develops  and  retains  talented
people.”

Demographic variables

Respondents were asked to indicate their demographic variables,
which  included  personal  as  well  as  organizational  variables.
Personal variables included: family status; education: B.A. or M.A.
degree; gender; age and tenure in the organization. Organizational
variables  included:  work  method  (case  management,  community
work,  or  generalist);  workload  (full  or  part  time);  status  in  the
organization  (regular  employee,  team  leader,  manager);  and  con-
tract  work  (permanent  or  temporary  personal  contract).  These

demographic  variables  were  used  to  control  the  relationship
between the independent and the dependent variable.

Data analysis

A  correlation  matrix  was  generated  to  examine  the  relationship
between independent and dependent variables. Least-square mul-
tiple hierarchy was employed to analyze the research hypotheses,
while in each model, the control variables were entered ﬁrst in order
to control the results.

Results

The descriptive statistics, means, standard deviations, reliabilities,
and the correlations among the research variables are presented
in Table 1. All scales had reliabilities clearly equal to or above the
0.68  level,  approximating  the  rate  recommended  by  Nunnaly
(1978).

separately is limited. Hence, we looked for a more powerful explana-
tion regarding the predictor variables of organizational reputation.
We conducted a model regression that combined all the predictor

variables and their inﬂuence on organizational reputation. As in
the  former  models,  the  initial  equation  regressed  organizational
reputation on the four control variables. Then we added all of the
independent variables (i.e., organizational commitment, OCB, and
job performance). The results indicated a stability of the previous
models’ ﬁndings. The control variables showed no signiﬁcant rela-
tionship with organizational reputation. As found earlier, affective
commitment (β = 0.61, p < 0.001) and organizational behavior
(β = 0.23, p < 0.001) did have an effect on organizational reputation.
The addition of the second equation produced a signiﬁcant change
in  R 2  (∆R 2 = 0.379,  p < 0.001).  Thus,  the  independent  variables
account for a unique variance in organizational reputation.

The results of the ﬁrst three models yield that four factors affect
organizational reputation: affective and continuance organizational
commitment, organizational behavior, and job performance; how-
ever, affective commitment seems to have the strongest relationship
with organizational reputation, as it accounts for a powerful and
unique variance of the dependent variable.

Discussion

The goal of this study was to explore the impact of work and work-
place attitudes of social workers on their perception of their organi-
zation’s  reputation.  Although  organizational  reputation  has  long
been  acknowledged  as  a  multifaceted  construct,  most  empirical
studies  have  not  yet  gone  beyond  exploring  the  relationship
between organizational reputation and the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial perfor-
mance and stock market value (e.g., Hammond and Slocum, Jr.,
1996; McGuire, Sundgren, and Schneewiess, 1988; Mcmillan and
Joshi, 1997; Roberts and Dowling, 1997; Srivastava, McInish, Wood,
and  Capraro,  1997).  The  major  contribution  of  this  study  is  the
revealing of the relationship between human behavior, social workers’
work and workplace attitudes, and organizational reputation.

Olins  (1990)  refers  to  organizational  prestige  as  the  organiza-
tional identity, which includes, inter alia, the dimension of human
behavior. The human behavior factor is critical when evaluating ser-
vice organizations. Service is a socio-psychological process; therefore,
its handling of social and psychological aspects is possibly the
essence of the service. Organizations can have top-quality service

operations;  however,  neglecting  their  clients’  psychological
needs  would  lead  to  the  ﬁrm’s  decline  (Norman,  1990).  Welfare
organization employees provide the social and psychological link
between  the  organization  and  its  customers.  As  Vergin  and
Qoronﬂeh (1998) pointed out, prestige reﬂects everyday behavior
exhibited by numerous small decisions.

There  is  still  another  important  facet  in  the  organizational
reputation of welfare organizations. These organizations, which
traditionally  did  not  have  a  positive  organizational  reputation,
are  required  to  manage  the  organizational  resources  efﬁciently,
adhering to concepts of advanced management and adapting these
to match their particular organizational reality. A positive organiza-
tional reputation can assist the organization on several levels.
In a reality where resources dwindle and the abundance of privati-
zation processes has an immediate affect on welfare organizations,
a favorable organizational reputation can aid in the gathering
of  high-quality  resources  from  the  environment.  Both  human
resources and project advancement initiatives are more accessible
to organizations identiﬁed as having a ﬁrst-rate reputation. More-
over, the organizational reputation has a direct inﬂuence on the
clients of these welfare organizations: a poor organizational rep-
utation  means  that  the  sense  of  overall  deﬁciency  is  transferred
from  the  professional  workers  to  the  population  of  clients.  This
becomes  meaningful  when  the  population  involved  is  weak  and
powerless from the start. Although the importance of organizational
reputation in welfare organizations is well recognized, research in
this area has just begun, which makes the ﬁndings brought here all
the more important.

The  results  of  this  study  support  the  anticipated  relationship
between  social  workers’  work  and  workplace  attitudes  and  the
organizational reputation of social welfare organizations in Israel.
Four work factors were signiﬁcantly related to organizational repu-
tation: affective commitment, continuance commitment, organizational
behavior,  and  job  performance.  However,  other  factors  such  as
demographic  characteristics  showed  no  signiﬁcant  relationship
with organizational reputation (Freund and Carmeli, 2003).

Organizational commitment is about the employees’ attachment
to the organization (Porter, et al., 1974). Studies have pointed out
that employees with a strong organizational commitment enhance
their organization’s effectiveness (Angle and Perry, 1981). The results


ANAT FREUND

81

of  this  study  basically  support  the  argument  that  organizational
prestige is an output of the organization’s practices. Furthermore,
this study extended the examination, by exploring the effects of
two major forms of organizational commitment on organizational
reputation.  Results  indicate  that  in  order  to  develop  a  solid  and
favorable reputation, organizations should redouble their efforts
to secure a human resource system consisting of employees who
display strong affective—rather than continuance—commitment. It
appears  that  employees  with  a  strong  affective  commitment  per-
ceive their organization as having a more favorable organizational
reputation. They want to remain in and are therefore committed to
the  organization;  thus,  they  have  a  more  favorable  view  of  their
organization’s reputation.

The  ﬁnding  that  affective  organizational  commitment  has  the
most powerful inﬂuence over organizational reputation in the case
of social workers suggests that organizational reputation should
be tested in relation to various professional sectors. In the case of
social workers, whose professional ethics espouse clear-cut profes-
sional values and encourage affective commitment, a conviction that
the organization in which they work reﬂects these principled goals
and professional values is a professional prerequisite. Thus, when
afﬁliated with a welfare organization that meets their professional
ethics and values, social workers ﬁnd it easier to identify with the
organization  and  they  perform  more  efﬁciently  and  professionally.
Affective  organizational  commitment  thus  reﬂects  social  workers’
belief in their organization. Therefore, we should note that this ﬁnd-
ing is particularly relevant in the case of social workers, and it is
important that it be validated for other professional sectors as well.
One  of  the  early  assumptions  was  that  OCB  in  the  aggregate
improves overall organizational prestige (Organ, 1988; Organ and
Paine, 1999). Despite the plausibility of the relationship between
OCB and organizational reputation, this issue to date has received
little empirical attention (Podsakoff, et al., 2000). To our knowledge,
no study has yet tested the relationship between helping behavior
and organizational reputation. Considering prestige as an output
measure, the only theoretical and empirical benchmark to date has
pertained to the rationale presented by Organ (1988), which claims
that OCB enhances organizational performance.

Organizational  citizenship  behavior  represents  the  kinds  of
behaviors that aren’t included in the formal framework of the job.

BUSINESS AND SOCIETY REVIEW

When this ﬁnding is tested and the speciﬁc population used in the
study is taken into account (i.e., social workers in welfare organiza-
tions), this ﬁnding becomes all the more interesting, because social
workers  are  frequently  required  to  apply  professional  behavior
outside the formal framework. Social workers face competition over
resources while representing clients; therefore, they must demon-
strate a thorough knowledge both of the client’s rights and the
pertinent places to ask for resources for the client, and they must
be familiar with various direct and indirect methods of treatment.
Consequently, organizational citizenship behavior is of great impor-
tance where social workers are concerned. According to the results of
the present study, social workers who display strong organizational
citizenship  behaviors  perceive  their  organizations’  prestige  in  a
more  favorable  way,  indicating  that  organizational  citizenship
behavior is tightly connected to organizational reputation. Again,
these behaviors are especially important in the case of the present
study’s professional population. The fact that the participants were
employees enhances the plausibility that their report approximates
the organizations’ actual reputation ranking among their external
constituencies.

The results of this study show a weak connection between job
performance and organizational reputation. Here, the professional
background and identity of the population on which we conducted
the research constitute an important and differentiating factor. In
the case of social workers in welfare organizations, the entire issue
of output appraisal is called into question, which makes it difﬁcult
for  social  workers  to  appraise  their  own  output.  While  output
appraisal is considered an important issue in modern management,
it is barely addressed in the Israeli social services system. The
concepts of both organizational and personal output are just now
beginning to receive attention in Israel. This leads to two signiﬁcant
conclusions:  it  is  important  to  introduce  output  appraisal  into
welfare organizations in general, and to reassess the inﬂuence such
appraisal has on workers’ perception of organizational reputation.
The  present  ﬁndings  indicate  that  social  workers  perceive  the
connection between their own job performance and organizational
reputation as weak. According to them, organizational reputation
is  based  much  more  on  the  correlation  between  organizational
objectives and professional values than on the individual perfor-
mance of social workers.

This ﬁnding is surprising, given the assumption that individual
performance affects organizational performance, which in turn is
expected to affect organizational reputation. Its implications merit
consideration.  Personnel  management  may  ﬁnd  it  necessary  to
address the differential effects of affective organizational commit-
ment and job performance on organizational reputation. They should
direct  considerable  attention  to  enhancing  employees’  affective
organizational  commitment,  whereas  job  performance  is  less
likely to be controlled from within the organization. Finally, the
results  suggest  that  a  “complex  emotional  reaction  to  the  job”
(Locke,  1969:  314)  is  an  essential  component  in  the  way  social
workers perceive their organization’s reputation.

Several suggestions for future research should be mentioned.
It is essential to validate the relationship between work attitudes
and organizational reputation, especially in social welfare organiza-
tions. Further studies should examine organizational prestige
as perceived by both the organization’s members and its external
constituencies, such as customers and suppliers. It is also recom-
mended  to  further  investigate  the  effects  of  both  organizational
commitment and organizational citizenship behavior on organiza-
tional reputation, and to check differences among social workers,
social areas, and social organizations.

To date, there has been too little research conducted on the atti-
tudes of social workers, despite the great importance of this issue.
It  is  especially  important  to  continue  this  research  regarding
the population of social workers and welfare organizations, given
the frequency of numerous and meaningful processes that welfare
organizations undergo in Israel and the world. Processes such as
privatization, development of the third sector in welfare services,
and  trimming  of  welfare  resources  force  the  managers  of  the
organizations to move toward more efﬁcient and measurable work
methods.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  identify  and  deﬁne  the
factors that inﬂuence organizational output, such as organizational
reputation and performance appraisal.

The reader is advised to recognize the limitations of this study.
The study is based on self-reported data and thus may carry a bias
of general method variance. However, validated and usable mea-
sures  were  employed  to  reduce  the  possibility  of  bias  in  general
method  variance,  although  difﬁculties  with  self-enhancement,
objectivity, and reliability may be encountered. Hochwarter, Perrewe,

Ferris,  and  Brymer  (1999)  showed  that  self-evaluation  measures
were more valid than indicated in prior research. Furthermore, the
random  choice  of  participants  also  reduced  the  probability  of
such bias.
