UNION  EFFECTS  ON PRODUCTIVITY: 

EVIDENCE  FROM  WESTERN  U.S. SAWMILLS 

MERWIN  W.  MITCHELL 

and JOE  A. STONE* 

The  authors  conjecture  that  previous  studies  have  tended  to 
overestimate the productivity of union firms relative to nonunion firms 
due  to  inadequate  controls for output quality and  input usage- 
important omissions if the higher cost of unionized labor leads to less 
labor-intensive products and techniques. To  avoid those problems, this 
study examines a fairly standardized commodity, lumber, and controls 
for detailed product attributes and inputs. An analysis of data from a 
survey administered by the authors shows that unionized sawmills were 
between 12% and 21% less productive than nonunionized mills in fiscal 
year 1986. As predicted, when product quality and raw material usage 
are not included in the analysis, the estimate of union productivity is 
biased upward. 

SEVERAL  recent studies address the ques- 
tion of whether and how unions affect 
production technology in the private sec- 
tor. Most find that unions increase pro- 
ductivity, suggesting that any  negative 
effects of restrictive work rules and other 
constraints on employers are outweighed 
by the positive effects of better communi- 
cation, improved screening, increased mo- 
rale,  lower  turnover, and  the  like  (as 
argued by Freeman and  Medoff [1984] 
and others). Addison and Hirsch (1989), 
however, are  skeptical of  this finding,

arguing that it is tainted by a number of 
methodological problems, including the 
use in some studies of value-added mea- 
sures of output (measures that mix price 
and quantity variations) and the failure to 
measure all major inputs accurately. 

In this study, we reexamine the union 
productivity issue using firm-level data for 
fiscal year 1986 that enable us to account 
for  the  major  dimensions of  product 
quality and types of inputs, including raw 
materials. Thus,  we are able  to address 
directly two of the objections raised by 
Addison and Hirsch to previous estimates 
of union productivity effects. The  firms 
we  analyze  are  all  from the  western 
sawmill industry and, with the exception 
of  a  few  easily  observed  differences, 
produce a standardized product, lumber. 

Literature Review 

Among the published studies examining 
union productivity effects, the most de- 
tailed  are  Clark's  (1980a  and  1980b) 
studies of cement producers and Allen's

(1986) study of school, hospital, and office 
construction. Because  these studies use 
physical measures of output, they avoid 
the pitfalls of the value-added measures 
used  in  other similar research on  the 
private sector (such as Brown and Medoff 
[1978]  and  Clark  [1984]).'  In  common 
with other studies, however, the Clark and 
Allen  studies appear  to  lack  adequate 
controls for output quality and  use  of 
nonlabor inputs. If the higher wage and 
benefit costs of unionized producers in- 
duce them to switch to less labor-intensive 
products and  production techniques (as 
suggested by Addison and Hirsch [1989] 
and  Reynolds  [1986]),  then  failure to 
control for important aspects of product 
quality or major inputs may bias upward 
estimates of the union productivity effect. 
In  the  Clark  studies of  the  cement 
industry, for example, bulk cement is not 
distinguished from bagged cement, which 
is more labor-intensive. If the higher wage 
and benefit costs of unionized producers 
induce  them to switch from bagged  to 
bulk shipping, or if unionized producers 
are larger, on average, than nonunionized 
producers (larger firms tend to ship in 
bulk  and  run  "ready-mix" operations), 
then a  positive correlation between bulk 
shipping and unionization will tend to bias 
upward the estimate of the union produc- 
tivity effect. In addition, the Clark studies 

1 Some studies of the public sector are based on 
physical/quantitative measures  of  output.  These 
include studies by Ehrenberg et al. (1983), who find 
no significant union effect for municipal libraries; 
Eberts and  Stone (1987),  who find a  significantly 
positive effect for public elementary schools; and 
Milkman (1989),  who finds a  significantly positive 
effect for  public  high  schools.  A  number  of 
researchers have also examined the effect of union- 
ization on productivity in coal mining. For example, 
Pencavel (1977) finds negative effects in turn-of-the- 
century British coal  fields, and  Boal  (1990)  finds 
negative effects for small West Virginia mines in the 
1920s, but not for large mines. 

An additional paper, Allen (1987), investigates cost 
differences between union and nonunion construc- 
tion firms. If, however, "efficient" contracts cause a 
divergence from cost-minimizing behavior (see Add- 
ison and Hirsch [1989] and Eberts and Stone [1986, 
1991]), the parameters of the underlying technology 
cannot  be  retrieved directly via  the  usual  cost 
parameters. Addison and  Hirsch (1989)  provide a 
critical survey of the issues in this literature. 

do  not account for the sand, clay, ash, 
gypsum, or other raw materials essential 
to the production (and quality) of cement. 
If raw material usage is more intensive in 
union firms, then ignoring raw materials 
will lead  to  a  similar upward  bias  in 
estimates of union productivity. 

The  problems of output heterogeneity 
and omitted raw materials also appear to 
arise in Allen (1986), which reports signif- 
icantly positive productivity effects for 
unionization in school, hospital, and office 
construction based  on physical measures 
of output (square feet of construction and 
student capacity). Despite  controls for 
some important building attributes (height 
and type of exterior wall, frame, and floor 
covering), square feet and student capacity 
measures may mask substantial heteroge- 
neity in building type and  design. Also, 
the study is unable to control for various 
types of inputs brought from off-site (for 
example, the amount of bricks, wallboard, 
lumber, or cement). 

Data and Empirical Specification 

The  sawmill industry, one of the first 
major  manufacturing industries in  the 
West, has  played  a  major  role  in  the 
growth and development of the economies 
of Washington, Oregon, northern Califor- 
nia, Idaho, and Montana.2 Small sawmill 
plants coexist with large  plants, single- 
plant firms with multiplant firms, and 
unionized  plants  with  nonunionized 
plants, even within the same firm. Unions 
arose early in the industry's development, 
and  rivalries were intense both between 
unions and employers and among unions. 
By the late 1950s, however, over 80% of 
western woodworkers were  unionized, 
and  the two major unions (the Lumber 
Production Industry Workers [LPIW] and 
the International Woodworkers Associa- 
tion [IWA]) were well established and no 
longer intense rivals. More recently, mem- 
bership in  woodworker unions has  de- 
clined, due  first to  the sharp  industry

recession of the early 1980s and then to an 
expanding nonunion sector, in some cases 
through decertification. 

The fundamental design of sawmills has 
not changed since the early part of the 
twentieth century, although productivity 
has increased significantly throughout the 
period.3 Logs are delivered to the headrig, 
or saw, by means of the carriage, and then 
cut lumber from the  "green  chain"  is 
sorted and stacked. The  two major types 
of saws, circular and band, have been used 
since 1875. Green lumber may or may not 
be dried and surfaced on site. 

Evaluation of the physical measure of 
output  (board  feet)  requires  consider- 
ation of a  number of important factors, 
including size and species of log, dimen- 
sion and grade of the lumber yield, and 
whether or  not  the  lumber  has  been 
dried and  surfaced. Recent increases in 
productivity have been due  primarily to 
automation of tasks previously done  by 
hand.  Automated  machines  that  stack 
and  sort  lumber,  for  example,  have 
greatly decreased  the amount of  labor 
needed to operate the green chains, and 
computer-controlled systems that  scan 
and  analyze the log for the optimal cut 
have made the sawyer more efficient and 
increased the yield of high-grade lumber 
from a given log. 
Data and Survey Design 

The total number of sawmills in Wash- 
ington,  Oregon,  northern  California, 
Idaho, and Montana is approximately 500. 
With a  projected response rate of about 
40%  to  60%,  a  sampling rate of 40% 
would be required to yield between 80 and 
120 responses, which we viewed as  the 
minimum sample size sufficient for analy- 
sis  of  production technologies in  this 
industry. The actual response rate to our 
survey questionnaire was about 46%, for a 
total of 96 individual mills. Of these, we 
excluded  three that were specialty mills 
for hardwoods, redwoods, or other spe- 
cialty woods, and  ten that had  insuffi-

ciently complete data. Thus,  the sample 
we examine has  a  total of 83  sawmills, 
46  of which are unionized and  37  non- 
union. 

The  survey instrument requests infor- 
mation for fiscal year 1986 on the quantity 
and quality of output, the major inputs, 
and union status. This period was one of 
modest industry growth following rela- 
tively stable output (but low prices) earlier 
in the decade.  The  physical measure of 
output is millions of board feet of lumber 
produced, but a  number of qualitative 
measures of output (expressed as percent- 
ages  of total output) are  also  included: 
type of  growth (old-growth or  second- 
growth logs), species (Douglas fir, hem-fir, 
pine, or other), dimension (boards up to 
ten inches wide, studs, or boards less than 
ten  inches  wide,  not  including studs), 
grade  ("common" versus "clear" for fir 
species,  "shop"  or  "better" for  pine), 
whether  or  not  surfaced  (meaning 
planed), and whether or not dried. Means 
and  standard deviations of the data are 
presented in Table  1 by union status. The 
output of union mills is about 30% higher 
than that of nonunion mills, but signifi- 
cantly so  only at the  10%  level, which 
reflects the  substantial variation within 
both sectors. 

The  input variables collected are pro- 
duction hours (thousands of hours worked 
for  production  personnel),  supervisory 
hours  (thousands of  hours worked for 
supervisory personnel), capital stock (as- 
sessed  value  in  millions of  dollars  of 
buildings and equipment used in lumber 
production), and  sawtimber (millions of 
board feet of logs used  as  inputs, mea- 
sured using a  standard scale called  the 
Scribner  Log  Rule).  The  capital-stock 
measure may require additional explana- 
tion. The  states in the region assess the 
value of buildings and equipment as the 
sum  of  their individual resale  market 
values,  independent  of  location, given 
their actual depreciation. Land is assessed 
as though there were no factory on  the 
premises. This  capital measure is  more 
comprehensive and  market-based than

sory labor, capital stock, and sawtimber),

input ratio relative to the corresponding 
nonunion ratio is 0.73  for the ratio of

0.67 for the ratio of production hours to 
capital stock, and  0.72  for the ratio of 
production hours to sawtimber-all  less 
than one, consistent with substitution away 
from union labor. 

Empirical Specification 

Formally, we specify a translog produc- 
tion function in the inputs that permits 
nonneutral union effects and controls for 
the quality of the lumber produced. The 
translog function is a  second-order ap- 
proximation to  any  arbitrary function, 
although it requires nonzero values of all 
inputs. Returns-to-scale and the elasticity 
of substitution are not constrained to any 
fixed  value.  Most  previous  studies  of 
union  productivity in the private sector 
use a Cobb-Douglas production function, 
which constrains the elasticity of substitu- 
tion to  one  and  tends to  increase the 
absolute  value  of  any  union/nonunion 
differential (Addison and  Hirsch (1989: 
76). the Cobb-Douglas function is rejected 
in our data, but we also present estimates 
of this function to permit direct compari- 
sons with previous studies. 

Empirical Results 

We  estimate the  parameters for the 
translog and Cobb-Douglas functions us- 
ing ordinary least squares after scaling the 
input data relative to the sample means.5 
To  conserve on  the limited degrees of 
freedom, we omit in our final specifica- 
tions those nonlinear inputs and  quality 
controls listed in Table  1 that are individ- 
ually insignificant at the 20%  level. The 
omitted terms are also jointly insignificant 
at the 5% level (F  =  1.06 [15,57], for the 
pooled  translog specification). The  data 

reject neutrality of the union effects (F  = 
2.07  [9,63]),  but  estimates with both 
nonneutral and neutral union effects are 
presented in Table 2. Analogous estimates 
of Cobb-Douglas  specifications are  pre- 
sented in Table 3 for purposes of compar- 
ison. 

The overall goodness of fit is quite high, 
with R-squares of 0.957 for the nonunion 
translog specification, 0.943 for the union 
translog specification, and  0.936  for the 
pooled specification with a neutral inter- 
cept shift for union  status. The  Cobb- 
Douglas  specification is not rejected for 
the nonunion plants at the 5% level (F  = 
0.94 [2,27]), but is rejected for the union 
plants (F  =  15.16 [2,36]) and the pooled 
sample (F  =  14.06 [2, 72]). 

Production hours, supervisory hours, 
and  sawtimber are all statistically signifi- 
cant across all specifications in Table  2, 
whereas the capital stock is significant (at 
the 10% level) only in the pooled  Cobb- 
Douglas specification in Table  3.6 Capital 
stock is highly collinear with the output 
quality controls and becomes significant if 
these controls are omitted (see Table 4), so 
the separate effects of capital stock and 
these controls are difficult to disentangle 
in these data.7 The only significant nonlin- 
ear input terms in the translog specifica- 
tion are the quadratic term for sawtimber 
(L x L)  and  the interaction between pro- 
duction hours and sawtimber (P x L). The 
quadratic term indicates a sharply declin- 
ing marginal product for sawtimber, and 
the interaction indicates that additional 
production workers improve the marginal 
product of  sawtimber (and  vice-versa). 
These terms are significant only for union 
mills and are the primary source of the 
significant non-neutral differences be- 

5 Scaling the data yields first-order translog coeffi- 
cients that coincide  with output  elasticities and 
marginal products (evaluated  at  sample  means). 
Changes in marginal products (at sample means) in 
this case  equal  the  sum  of  the  own  first-order 
coefficient squared, minus that coefficient, plus two 
times the own second-order coefficient. Thus, the 
regularity conditions of nonnegative and nonincreas- 
ing marginal products can be examined directly from 
the estimated coefficients. 

6 Previous studies typically consider only produc- 
tion hours. For this reason, and because production 
and  supervisory labor are  analytically distinct, we 
maintain a  distinction between  production  and 
supervisory hours, even  though their effects are 
statistically indistinguishable. 

7 Instrumental variable estimates of the capital- 
stock coefficient, based  on  omitted output-quality 
variables as identifying instruments, are similar, and 
the null hypothesis of exogeneity is not rejected at 
the 5% level based on a Hausman test.

tween the union and nonunion specifica- 
tions. However, the nonlinear terms do 
not contribute substantially to  a  union 
productivity differential, because  they 
tend to be  offsetting. That  is, the qua- 
dratic term for sawtimber is negative for 
union  firms, but  the  interaction term 
between labor and  sawtimber is positive. 
Even if evaluated at the union averages 
for  sawtimber and  labor  (which  are 
larger), the contribution of the nonlinear 
terms to the overall productivity differen- 
tial is only -0.003  (-0.3%),  essentially 
zero. 

The  regularity conditions of nonnega- 
tive, nonincreasing marginal products are 
met for production hours, supervisory 
hours, capital stock, and sawtimber in the 
restricted translog specifications in Table 
2,  whether evaluated  at  the nonunion, 

union,  or  sample  means.8 The  capital 
stock  coefficients, of  course,  are  not 
statistically different from zero. All speci- 
fications exhibit (approximate) constant 
returns-to-scale. In the translog specifica- 
tions, the  returns-to-scale parameter is 
1.03 for nonunion plants, 1.06 for union 
plants, and 1.06 for the pooled sample. In 
the Cobb-Douglas  specifications, the re- 
turns-to-scale parameter is 1.01 for non- 
union plants, 1.09 for union plants, and 
1.01 in the pooled sample.9 

The  only  significant quality  control 
variables are for stud production (Studs),

The  returns-to-scale parameters change only 
slightly if evaluated at the separate union and

clear lumber (Clear), and  dried lumber 
(Dried),  which are  significant across all 
specifications. As  expected,  the  highly 
standardized production process for studs 
requires fewer inputs for a given output 
(or, equivalently, yields more output with 
the same inputs), whereas production of 
clear  and  dried  lumber requires more 
inputs (or yields less output with the same 
inputs). 

Union/Nonunion Productivity 
Differentials 

Looking first at the coefficient on union 
status in the translog estimates, we find 
that  unionized  mills  are  about  1 1% 
(e -0.111  -  1) less productive than non- 
unionized mills, with a t-statistic of - 2.64. 
In the Cobb-Douglas estimates, unionized 
mills are  estimated to  be  about  15% 
1)  less  productive, with a 
(e-0.158 
t-statistic of  -3.36.  (Note  that, as  ex- 
pected, the estimate obtained from the 

- 

Cobb-Douglas  specification is  larger in 
absolute value than that from the translog 
specification.) '0 

One  can also calculate the union pro- 
ductivity differentials based  on  all  the 
individual coefficient differences between 
nonunion and  union plants reported in 
Table 2, weighted by individual plant data 

10 One  argument related to output quality is the 
following: higher quality output requires greater 
worker skills; unions create an environment condu- 
cive to the training and retention of skilled workers; 
thus, unions make firms more productive by en- 
abling  them  to  produce  higher-quality outputs. 
However, only one of the three measures of output 
quality for our sample of sawmills is higher for union 
mills: union mills produce fewer studs. The  other 
two  measures  of  output  quality are  higher for 
nonunion  mills: nonunion  mills produce  higher 
proportions of lumber that is clear and dried. If the 
one output quality variable that is higher for union 
mills (studs)  is  deleted  from the  estimates, the 
estimated union effect is approximately the same 
(-  0.12  versus - 0.1 1  in the pooled  specification, 
with a t-value of - 2.56).

for the nonunion and union subsamples. 
Multiplying the individual coefficient dif- 
ferences by the individual plant data for 
the nonunion sample yields an estimate of 
-.130  (about 12%), which is significantly 
different from zero at the 5%  level and 
virtually the same as the estimated inter- 
cept effect of - .1 10 in the pooled sample. 
Multiplying the individual coefficient dif- 
ferences by the individual plant data for 
the union sample yields an  estimate of 
-.230  (about 21%), which is also signifi- 
cantly different from zero. 

The  modestly larger estimate based on 
the union sample appears to result from 
the interaction between the nonlinearities 
in the production functions and the very 
large scale of a  few union plants."  For 
example, the estimated differential based 
solely on the means of the union subsam- 
ple,  rather than  the  individual union 
plants, is  - .150  (about  14%),  which is 
close to the estimated intercept effect. The 
estimated differential based solely on the 
means  of  the  nonunion  subsample  is 
-  .143 (about 13%), virtually identical. 

Importance of Product Quality and 
Raw Materials 

Our  criticisms of the estimates in the 
Clark  (1980)  and  Allen  (1986)  studies 
center on the issues of product heteroge- 
neity and  use  of  raw  materials. How 
important in  our  application  are  the 
controls for  product  quality and  raw 
materials? That  is, what estimate of the 
union productivity effect would obtain if 
the various aspects of lumber quality and 
the  amount  of  sawtimber used  were 
ignored? Estimates with these variables 
omitted are presented in Table 4 for the 
pooled specification. The restricted trans- 
log and Cobb-Douglas functions coincide 
in this case, because the only significant 
nonlinear terms involve sawtimber, which 
is omitted in this specification. For the 
same  reason,  neutrality for the  union/ 

"  The  nonlinearities arise both because  of the 
nonlinearities intrinsic to the translog and because 
the logarithm of an average is not the average of a 
logarithm.

nonunion coefficient differences is  not 
rejected in the Cobb-Douglas specification 
(F  =  1.56  [7,69]). 

Most notable in the results is the fact 
that the union  coefficient is  no  longer 
significant. The  union productivity effect 
is  negative  and  statistically significant 
when output quality controls and sawtim- 
ber are included, but insignificantly differ- 
ent from zero when they are not. Thus, 
omitting these variables tends to bias the 
union productivity effect upward. More- 
over, with the exception of stud produc- 
tion, these variables reflect a shift of union 
firms toward less  labor-intensive tech- 
niques  and  products.'2  Obviously, the 
Cobb-Douglas  specification is  also  no 
longer rejected in favor of the translog 
when the product quality and sawtimber 
variables are omitted, because  those are 
the only variables for which the additional 
nonlinear terms were significant. 

12 The stud variable appears to be an anomaly in 
this discussion: it has a positive effect on production, 
and union mills produce fewer studs. Stud produc- 
tion  tends  to  be  more  standardized  than  the 
production of other small-dimension boards and uses 
lower-quality sawtimber.

UNION  EFFECTS  ON  PRODUCTIVITY 

143 

Interpreting the Union Effect 

The decrease in productivity we find for 
unions in this industry could be due to a 
number  of  factors.  "Featherbedding" 
clauses in union contracts, however, do 
not appear to be one of them. Interviews 
with industry managers and  union offi- 
cials in the region indicate a  consensus 
that the two major unions, the IWA and 
LPIW,  have  not bargained the sorts of 
grossly restrictive work  rules  typically 
characterized as  "featherbedding"-rules 
that explicitly require redundant labor. 
Our own examination of individual union 
contracts suggests the same  conclusion, 
although the contracts do typically restrict 
the types of work performed by particular 
types of workers. 

Two  other possibilities raised  in  the 
interviews appear  more  likely, if  still 
speculative. One  is the much more wide- 
spread use of "incentive pay" programs in 
nonunion mills, which make compensa- 
tion at the individual, work team, and mill 
levels partially dependent  on  levels of 
production and  profitability.'3 Managers 
of firms in the industry that have both 
union  and  nonunion  mills argue,  for 
example, that workers under incentive pay 
programs are  more attentive to routine 
maintenance, with a consequent reduction 
in the frequency and duration of machin- 
ery breakdowns. 

A second possibility is greater flexibility 
in  learning and  performing alternative 
tasks in nonunion mills. Managers in the 
industry claim that, due in part to contrac- 
tual limitations and seniority restrictions, 
union workers are less likely to learn and 
perform (temporarily) jobs  other  than 
their own. Consequently, absenteeism in 
nonunion mills, they argue, has a smaller 
impact on  productivity than  in  union 
mills, because  most  of  the  nonunion 

13 Almost no union mills have such incentive-pay 
provisions in  the  union  contract, whereas  such 
provisions are common in nonunion mills. In  one 
nonunion mill, incentive pay is large enough to raise 
total compensation per hour above the average in 
union  mills. In  some  other industries, however, 
union plants have implemented incentive-pay pro- 
grams. 

workers are  skilled in several positions. 
This  claim  is  consistent with evidence 
presented by Maranto (1985) that senior- 
ity tends  to  reduce  the  incentives to 
acquire on-the-job training in union firms. 
Thus, the various factors suggested by pre- 
vious studies (for example, Allen 1986) as 
sources of union productivity advantages in 
other industries (such as improved training, 
lower turnover, improved morale, and man- 
agerial superiority) do  not appear  domi- 
nant in the western sawmill industry. The 
pressure of product-market competition, 
which is strong in the sawmill industry, also 
does not appear sufficient to erode the union 
productivity disadvantage. How, then, can 
less productive union firms survive in the 
industry? In fact, the share of union firms 
in the industry has been in decline for some 
time, as noted above. Thus, the industry may 
not be in long-run equilibrium in terms of 
the proportion of union and  nonunion 
firms. Another explanation may lie in the 
fact that the largest union firms typically 
own large private timber stands. This ver- 
tical integration may provide some offset- 
ting efficiencies. Of course, we consider only 
on-site production. 

Other Specification Issues 

At  least  two  additional  specification 
issues are  worthy of note. First, differ- 
ences in the vintage of union and  non- 
union mills may be important. Union mills 
are an average of eight years older than 
nonunion mills. Inclusion of a variable for 
mill vintage, however, does  not substan- 
tially affect the  results. Second,  union 
status may be endogenous, perhaps due to 
a  selection process in  which mills with 
some unobserved source of productivity 
advantage  are  more  likely both  to  be 
organized and to survive once organized 
(as argued by Addison and Hirsch [1989]). 
This  source  of  upward  bias,  however, 
would make the actual union productivity 
effect even more negative than the esti- 
mated one. Thus, neither mill vintage nor 
endogeneity of union status appears  to 
account for the productivity differential 
found in our sample.

INDUSTRIAL  AND  LABOR  RELATIONS  REVIEW 

Concluding Remarks 

Previous studies of union/nonunion dif- 
ferences in  productivity in  the  private 
sector have suffered from several prob- 
lems. Many have employed value-added 
measures  rather  than  physical output 
measures, an  approach with well-known 
drawbacks. Some  studies of the cement 
and  construction industries have  used 
physical measures of output, but they have 
not  adequately  accounted  for  product 
heterogeneity and have not controlled for 
raw  material usage-potentially  serious 
omissions, we have argued, because union- 
ized  firms may shift toward less labor- 
intensive products and  production tech- 
niques. We have attempted to avert these 
problems by relying on a relatively stan- 
dardized commodity, lumber, and utiliz- 
ing  detailed  product  attributes and  a 
measure of raw material usage. We find 
unionized plants to be  significantly less 
productive than nonunionized plants (by 
about 12-21%).  If the controls for prod- 
uct quality and  raw material usage  are 
omitted, however, the  estimated union 
effect on  productivity is biased  upward 
and no longer statistically significant. 

We  hypothesize that the productivity 

differential may arise, at  least in  part, 
through greater attention to machinery 
maintenance and  repair by workers in 
nonunion mills, who are subject to "incen- 
tive  pay"  programs,  or  through  the 
greater flexibility of the work force in 
nonunion mills, where workers are more 
apt to learn and perform a variety of jobs 
other than their own. Thus, unions may 
decrease  sawmill productivity via  subtle 
changes in the technology of production. 
It  is also  possible that the productivity 
differences we find are spuriously related 
to  union  status, although we  have  ex- 
plored and ruled out two explanations in 
that category (mill vintage and endogene- 
ity of union status). In any event, factors 
that have previously been cited to explain 
possible  union  productivity advantages, 
such as  better training, lower turnover, 
improved morale, and superior manage- 
ment in union firms, do not appear to be 
dominant factors in the western sawmill 
industry. Only further research can show 
whether our results reflect features pecu- 
liar to this industry or arise solely from 
superior controls for product quality and 
raw material usage.
