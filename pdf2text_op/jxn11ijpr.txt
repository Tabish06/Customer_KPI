In today’s highly competitive environment, a goal-oriented supply chain needs
coordination to manage the interdependent activities of supply chain partners.
The role of coordination mechanisms is critical
in achieving supply chain
performance. We thus suggest that supplier coordination and customer coordi-
nation influence performance, operationalised in this paper under two dimen-
sions, e.g., quality and flexibility. Moreover, drawing on contingency theory, we
suggest that the relationships are contingent upon factors such as firm size and
clockspeed. Using empirical data collected from 197 production/operations
managers of Chinese manufacturing firms, a regression analysis approach is
employed to test the theoretical framework. The results provide support for the
four direct and positive relationships between each coordination mechanism
studied and quality and flexibility performance. The interaction between supplier
coordination and size was directly and positively related to quality performance
(large size effect). However, the interaction between customer coordination and
size was directly and negatively related to flexibility performance (small size
effect). The interaction between supplier coordination and clockspeed was
directly and positively related to only flexibility performance. Implications for
managers and academics and suggestions for future research are offered.

1. Introduction

A supply chain is viewed as a network of firms involved in various activities such as
planning, design, distribution, selling, support, usage and recycling of products both
upstream and downstream, in order to add value in the form of products and services
delivered to end customers (Narasimhan and Jayaram 1998, Arshinder et al. 2008). These
firms pursue different goals, often to the detriment of one another. However, recent
research has suggested that supply chain performance depends on how well supply chain
partners work together and not on how well each partner firm performs individually.
In this common-goal view, the interdependent activities between supply chain entities
needs to be coordinated to achieve the best fit among supply chain partners. It has been
shown that poor coordination among supply chain members has negative consequences on
performance, such as inaccurate forecasts, low capacity utilisation, excessive inventory,

inadequate customer service, inventory turns, inventory costs, time to market, order
fulfilment response, quality, customer focus and customer satisfaction (Ramdas and
Spekman 2000).

Similarly, Fine (1998) argues that product design, process design and supply chain
design decisions have to be integrated to support one another in order for firms to stay
competitive. Hsu and Wallace (2007) argue that supply chains can be digitally connected
to enhance their performance. Staley and Warfield (2007) provide an example of a
collaborative planning system (C3P system) at Ford which provides product information
across and beyond the entire enterprise, extending into the supplier and customer base.
Internal integration facilitated via information sharing and use of computer technology
also leads to improved product performance (Li et al. 2005, Shu and Wang 2007). At the
same time, internal constituents seek to integrate with customers and suppliers in order to
obtain information necessary to reduce uncertainty and ultimately, enhance performance.
The logic that drives internal integration is equally relevant for integrating activities of
external entities (Koufteros et al. 2005). Thus, effective coordination must be developed
both within and outside the firm in order to convert competitive advantage into
profitability (Dyer and Singh 1998). Several studies have shown that firm coordination has
a positive impact on performance (Lee et al. 1997, Metters 1997, Narasimhan and Jayaram
1998, Johnson 1999, Frohlich and Westbrook 2001, Stank et al. 2001, Vickery et al. 2003).
Wal-Mart, for instance, shares sales and inventory information with its key suppliers
which allows the retailer to quickly replenish their shelves or on the other hand, to
discontinue the carrying of slow moving items (Hougland 2007). Also, Nike successfully
coordinates its design and marketing capabilities with manufacturing capabilities of its
suppliers in Asia, thereby keeping up with the changing requirements of its customers
(Jones 2007).

Given the nature of interdependence between supply chain members, coordination is a
necessary prerequisite for integrating operations in order to achieve the mutual goals of all
entities in a supply chain (Simatupang et al. 2002). Thus, coordination mechanisms, which
are tools for managing these interdependencies, are instrumental in eliminating supply
chain sub-optimisation and achieving desirable performance outcomes (Fugate et al.
2006). For instance, supplier coordination is critical given that purchasing represents
around 50% of the cost of goods sold by US manufacturers. Moreover, suppliers have
a great impact on cost, quality, technology, speed and responsiveness of buying firms
(Ragatz et al. 2002). Similarly, customer coordination, an example of another coordina-
tion mechanism, ensures that the voice of the customer is embedded in the product
development effort, thus boosting a firm’s product innovation and quality performance
(Koufteros et al. 2005).

In this paper, we investigate the direct impact of supplier and customer coordination
on quality and flexibility performance. Among the various dimensions of performance, we
focus on flexibility and quality performance as these are critical in today’s demanding and
fast changing environment. We seek to offer a different perspective on the relationship
between supplier and customer coordination, and performance as compared to the extant
literature, which will also benefit practitioners. Based on a literature review on supplier
and customer coordination from a contingency perspective, we investigate the contingency
influence of two important contextual variables of firm size and clockspeed on the
coordination to performance relationships. Specifically, we seek to understand how firm
size and clockspeed moderate the influence of supplier and customer coordination on
quality and flexibility performance.

The flow of this paper is that we use extant theories of coordination and contingency
to formulate our conceptual model. The related hypotheses and research design and
methodology are discussed next, followed by the statistical analysis and discussion
sections.

2. Literature review

The importance of coordination on organisational goals was recognised early in
organisation theory by Barnard (1938), who argued that ‘when ends have been adopted,
the coordination of acts as means to these ends is in itself an essentially logical process’
(Barnard 1938, p. 186). Often, good coordination is almost invisible and is mostly noticed
when it is lacking. Malone and Crowston (1994) define coordination as the process of
managing dependencies among activities. Although there have been several perspectives
addressing the issue of coordination, they all share the common precept of interdepen-
dence as a prerequisite to coordination (Malone and Crowston 1994). However,
coordination problems arise from dependencies that constrain how tasks can be
performed, and additional activities – coordination mechanisms – must be carried out
in order to overcome these problems (Crowston 1997).

2.1 Theoretical background on coordination theory

The interdependent activities that are performed by different actors in a supply chain to
achieve goals may require acquisition or creation of different resources (Crowston 1997).
There are three types of coordination: coordination between two tasks, coordination
between two resources, and coordination between a task and a resource (Crowston 1997).
The type of coordination used in the organisation is a function of the extent to which the
situation is standardised: coordination by plan is based on pre-established schedules,
whereas coordination by feedback involves transmission of new information (March and
Simon 1958). The type of organisation structure, i.e., centralised versus decentralised,
also facilitates the coordinated action of interdependent elements (Thompson 1967).
The concept of task interdependence is the extent to which the relationship between groups
could be categorised into one of the three patterns of workflow that exist between them,
namely pooled, sequential and reciprocal. As such,
the coordination mechanisms
corresponding to these types of
interdependence have been identified as being
standardisation of rules, planning and scheduling, and mutual adjustment (Thompson
1967). Van de Ven et al. (1976) added the fourth type of interdependence, the work unit of
a team, and proposed that uncertainty and team size are additional determinants of
coordination. They also argued that the need for group coordination increases as the level
of
types and levels of
interdependence between functions, two distinct aspects of coordination, namely the
amount of interdependence and the amount of conflict between functions, were proposed
by Victor and Blackburn (1987).

interdependence increases. To accommodate the different

Thompson’s (1967) typology was extended by Malone and Crowston (1994) who
suggested different kinds of dependencies, such as shared resources, producer/consumer
relationship, simultaneity and task/subtask, and corresponding coordination mechanisms
that can be used to manage them. The effectiveness of coordination mechanisms depends
on a shared view of coordination structure because it facilitates the visibility of the

interconnections between assignment of individual responsibilities and their interrelation-
ships to achieve some organisational objectives (Bailetti et al. 1994). More specifically,
Adler (1995) argued that, since the objective of coordinating design and manufacturing
departments is to ensure an acceptable fit between product design and manufacturing
process parameters, the most efficient interdepartmental coordination mechanism is that
which is able to deal with the uncertainty of this product/process fit at least cost to the
organisation. In this paper, we take this argument to the inter-firm level since the
interdependencies also arise between firms, i.e., between a buyer and its suppliers. Thus,
coordination becomes an even more critical issue as there is typically more than a single
governing authority within a supply chain that establishes the best coordination
mechanism among supply chain partners in order to achieve their mutual goals.

2.2 A contingency approach to supplier and customer coordination

While the literature on supply chain integration has offered several types of coordination,
such as customer/market coordination, information coordination, logistics and distribu-
tion coordination, supplier coordination, and purchasing coordination (Zhang et al. 2004,
Das et al. 2006, Li 2006, Beheshti et al. 2007, Hou 2009), our focus in this paper is on
supplier and customer coordination. Lately, research has shown that effective supplier
coordination is a key factor for manufacturers to remain competitive in today’s global
competition. Purchased materials represent around 50% of the cost of goods sold in
manufacturing industries worldwide, with a likelihood of percentage increase as the
volume of outsourced work continues to increase. Thus, supplier coordination is a critical
factor for improving performance in terms of costs, speed and product quality. Through
supplier involvement, the unique capabilities that allow a firm to build a competitive
advantage are complemented and enhanced.

Consistent with Frohlich and Westbrook’s (2001) question of whether it is more
important to link with suppliers, or link with customers or link with both, we are also
interested in studying customer coordination as well as supplier coordination. It is well-
known that customer integration involves determining customer requirements and
(Koufteros et al. 2005).
tailoring internal activities
Moreover, early customer integration leads to a stronger relationship with the partner,
a better understanding of market needs, fewer errors in the early development process and
a better product quality (Enkel et al. 2005).

these requirements

to meet

Contingency theory tries to understand organisational

issues from a contextual
perspective. Applying this framework to our research objective, it means that determining
how supplier and customer coordination impacts performance needs an analysis of the
specific contexts. The extant work that has been conducted with respect to supplier and
customer coordination is summarised in Table 1(a) and 1(b). A brief summary of these
works follows.

Ragatz et al. (2002) studied the effect of elements of the supplier integration process on
cost, quality, and new product development (NPD) time, under conditions of technology
uncertainty. Their findings suggested that technology uncertainty has a negative impact on
cost results, but no direct effect on quality or cycle time. Also, Petersen et al. (2003) found
prior knowledge of the supplier, sharing of technology and cost information, and supplier
involvement in decision making as influential factors on project success. Their results
indicated that the performance outcome problems associated with technology uncertainty

can be mitigated by greater use of technology sharing and direct supplier participation on
the NPD team. Furthermore, Petersen et al. (2003) concluded that there is no one best
method to integrate suppliers into NPD, and the level of technology uncertainty present
determines the relative moment when the supplier should become involved.

Using data from global organisations, Petersen et al. (2005) found support for the
value of early supplier involvement in the NPD process. More specifically, they identified
supplier involvement timing and level of supplier’s design responsibility as moderating
factors of the relationship between early supplier involvement and product design
performance or financial performance. Also, Parker et al. (2008) proposed a model that
explores the appropriate timing and level of integration with suppliers in NPD projects
employed by international organisations in various industries. The contingencies analysed
in this study include technological newness, buyer-supplier relationship and strategic
importance of the supplied item. The positive relationship found between the extent of
integration and perceived project performance needs to be interpreted in the broader
context of the model, namely the tight integration of allied strategic suppliers that provide
new technologies most often results in higher perceived performance.

Lakemond et al. (2006) examined practices of inter-organisational coordination of
supplier involvement in six product development projects performed at the Swedish
packaging company Tetra Brik, a world leader in paper-based solutions in the food
industry. Project integration coordination, direct ad hoc coordination, and disconnected
sub-project coordination are the three general types of coordination distinguished in this
case study. However, given that the three mechanisms are suitable under different
conditions, Lakemond et al. (2006) identified the need for a fine-tune approach to supplier
involvement in product development, based on an analysis of relevant contingency factors,
such as the degree of task dependency, diverging expectations, and the presence of long-
term intentions. In another case study (of eight NPD projects in four buying firms based in
the Netherlands in different industries), Van Echtelt et al. (2007) found that successful
supplier involvement is dependent on the coordinated design, execution and evaluation of
strategic long-term processes and operational short-term management processes, and the
presence of enabling factors such as a cross-functional oriented organisation. Moreover,
the required intensity of these processes and enablers depends on contingencies such as
firm size and environmental uncertainty.

Devaraj et al. (2007) found a positive impact of supplier integration on cost, quality,
flexibility and delivery performance, and no direct benefit of eBusiness technologies on
performance in manufacturing firms. However, Devaraj et al. (2007) claimed an indirect
relationship between eBusiness technologies and supplier integration that leads to better
performance, since these technologies support supplier integration.

Using data collected from 244 manufacturing firms in various industries, Koufteros
et al. (2005) investigated whether contextual variables such as uncertainty, equivocality
and platform development strategy moderate the relationships between integration
strategy (internal and external) and performance. Their findings indicated that both
internal and external integration positively influence product innovation and quality, and
thus profitability, with equivocality as a moderating factor. Also, Koufteros et al. (2007)
examined the antecedents and consequences of supplier integration in product develop-
ment activities. They found that, between the black-box integration (wherein the
development of components for the customers is carried out by suppliers on their own)
and grey-box integration (wherein suppliers work alongside the customer’s engineers for
product development), only grey-box integration shows a positive relationship with

product innovation. The results of this study partially supported the moderating impact
of firm size.

Recently, Jayaram (2008) tested the multidimensional nature of supplier involvement
in NPD projects in high-tech industries firms, and found it as comprising communication
and information sharing, design involvement, and infrastructure, all of which having
a positive impact on the project performance, operationalised in this study as product cost,
conformance quality, design quality and time-to-market. While the firm size was not
found a significant moderator, the study found support for the contingent influence of
market stability on the relationship between supplier involvement and NPD project
performance.

the extant

In conclusion,

literature on supplier coordination has revealed the
prevalence of studies which have focused on NPD projects, as involving suppliers in
NPD is critical in an ever-increasing competitive environment due to the expected positive
effect on development time, product cost and product quality. Although not always
empirically tested, the contingency factors have ranged from uncertainty (operationalised
as environmental or technological), market stability, equivocality, platform development
strategy, degree of task dependency, degree of diverging expectations, buyer-supplier
relationship, long-term collaboration objectives, stage of integration, supplier’s level of
responsibility, strategic importance of the supplied item, to firm size. The fact that the firm
size does not have an influence on the relationship between coordination and performance
could be noticed, although one study (Devaraj et al. 2007) claimed that its results are more
reflective of small to medium firms which formed 73% of the sample.

To our knowledge, there has been little research related to the contextual factors
affecting the impact of customer integration on performance. One study (Souder et al.
1998) examined the impact of R&D/customer
integration on NPD effectiveness
operationalised as NPD cycle time, prototype development proficiency, design change
frequency, R&D technical effectiveness, R&D commercialisation effectiveness, product
launch proficiency and market forecast accuracy. Based on 101 NPD projects at high-tech
firms in the US and the UK, the results of the study indicated that R&D/customer
integration has an impact on cycle time, R&D technical effectiveness and R&D
commercialisation effectiveness. Whereas both technical and market uncertainty have a
moderating effect on design change frequency, market uncertainty only moderates market
forecast accuracy.

Another study (Koufteros et al. 2005) investigated whether contextual variables such as
uncertainty, equivocality and platform development strategy moderate the relationships
between integration strategy (internal and external) and performance in various
manufacturing industries. The findings indicated that customer integration has an indirect
impact on quality through the effects on product
innovation, especially in high
equivocality environments. On the other hand, Devaraj et al. (2007) found that customer
integration, as measured by specific information flows and collaborative efforts with
customers, does not by itself relate to performance. That is, customer integration by itself
does not directly affect operational performance and must be implemented with supplier
integration to realise its full potential.

Based on our literature review, it appears that there is a need to identify the specific
conditions under which both supplier coordination and customer coordination in
manufacturing firms are effective. Hence, we propose investigating the extent with
which supplier coordination as well as customer coordination influence flexibility
performance and quality performance. Our research model is shown in Figure 1.

China provides a unique setting for our research objective. With its low-cost labour
resources, large economies of scale and low domestic-sourcing costs, China has emerged as
a key player in the global landscape. The country’s cost advantage is reflected in each stage
of the supply chain, from purchasing to manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, storage
and sales. This is also due to the large number of supply clusters that cover basically every
major product category. The geographic proximity of the firms within clusters facilitates
supply chain coordination, as firms can be more responsive and effective in managing their
supply chains. For instance, the flexibility of facilities and the capacity aggregation allow
for better handling of uncertain demand and supply disruptions. The large volumes of
purchased goods and shipments of finished goods can provide significant inbound and
outbound transportation costs savings. The shipping costs and flow of inventories between
suppliers and manufacturers within the supply cluster also benefit from the geographic
closeness of the firms. The sharing of information is facilitated by face-to-face meetings
which lead to developing personal relationships and community ties, which are very
important in Chinese business culture.

The proximity to Chinese suppliers can also be a factor for some manufacturers to
choose not to do business in China. That was the case of Sony Corp., which in 2002 shifted
production of its high-tech digital cameras and camcorders back to Japan, closer to its
suppliers of special high-tech parts. Since the cycle time is positively associated with supply
chain flexibility and responsiveness to market changes, Sony considered minimising the
cycle time of its high-end products as being more critical than minimising manufacturing
costs (Jiang 2003).

Similarly,

international car manufacturers that had established facilities in China
unexpectedly found that the cost of purchased goods in China could at times even exceed
the cost in traditional markets due to lower volumes. Lack of experience in the labour
pool, poor infrastructure, higher communication costs and second-class machinery or
processes could lead to inefficient production and higher costs (Hedderich et al. 2005).
Therefore, manufacturing industry in China is an interesting research setting to gain

insights about supply chain coordination and its impact on flexibility and quality
performance.

4. Research hypotheses

Contingency theory addresses the following question: ‘‘Are there any universally beneficial
practices or are there only contextually appropriate practices?’’ (Peteraf and Reed 2007,
p. 1090). In this study, we follow contingency theory by submitting the same question,
i.e., are supplier coordination and customer coordination always beneficial to firm
performance, or are there contextual factors that contribute to improved performance?
In other words, we investigate whether the fit between supplier coordination and customer
coordination on performance on one hand, and the moderating influence of firm size and
clockspeed on these relationships on the other hand, matters or not.

By having effective supplier coordination mechanism in place, a manufacturing firm
could align its suppliers’ capabilities (its external resources) to cope with unexpected
customer requirements with ease. For example, entering into long-term relationships with
suppliers is often the prerequisite to establish effective coordination mechanisms with
suppliers due to the co-dependency across entities in a supply chain (Spekman 1988). A
firm without such a long term perspective with its suppliers could hardly establish effective
and efficient coordination as the changing supplier landscape (e.g., infrastructure and
capabilities) often renders the existing coordination approach obsolete (Chen and
Paulraj 2004). Also, firms emphasising quality instead of costs when sourcing from a
supplier could ensure proper alignment of its own interests with its supplier’s (Jayaram
et al. 2004). It has been demonstrated in the extant literature that over-emphasising costs
in sourcing would create an adversarial, transaction-oriented, relation with the suppliers.
Finally, the use of supply base reduction strategies facilitates effective supplier coordi-
nation. By relying on a small number of high-quality suppliers, firms could coordinate
simultaneously with several suppliers and in particular enjoy deeper relationships
(Chen and Paulraj 2004, Choi and Krause 2006).

integration ensures

internal activities meet customer

In today’s highly competitive environment customers demand faster response and
a wider variety of products, whereas competitors achieve performance levels higher than
ever. In order to cope with this environment’s constraints, a firm needs to coordinate with
its suppliers and customers due to the interdependencies among them. Supplier
coordination can be viewed as a state of synchronisation among the supplier, purchasing
and manufacturing constituents of an organisation (Das et al. 2006). On the other hand,
customer
requirements
(Koufteros et al. 2005). Both types of coordination are necessary to achieve high
performance. Among the performance measures, flexibility is viewed as a solution.
A firm’s flexibility reflects its ability to effectively respond to market changes, and can be
characterised by three dimensions. First, product flexibility is the ability to handle
difficult, non-standard orders, to meet special customer specifications, and to produce
products characterised by numerous features, options, sizes, and colours (Vickery et al.
1997). Second, volume flexibility is the ability to effectively increase or decrease
production in response to customer demands, which require close coordination between
a manufacturer and its suppliers, especially when the demand is increasing. However,
neither product nor volume flexibility can be effective without the flexibility of the physical
processes employed for product manufacturing. In particular, a customer coordination

mechanism allows the manufacturing firm to clearly understand customer’s special needs
and specifications, and in turn arrange its internal resources to effectively serve such
exceptions. Understanding the special needs of customers requires firms to be in close and
frequent contact with its customers (Sanders 2007). Clearly, the more attention a firm pays
to researching its customer base in order to identify customer needs, the more rewarding
the exchange transaction in the supply chain will be for that company (Carson et al. 1998).
Also, with respect to its key customers, it has been suggested that firms visit their plant
in order to understand their underlying capabilities (Koufteros et al. 2005). Finally, it
has also been suggested that receiving periodical feedback from customers helps firms
improve their quality and delivery performance (Koufteros et al. 2005, Sanders 2007).
Thus, we propose that:

H1. Supplier coordination is directly and positively related to flexibility performance.

H2. Customer

coordination is directly and positively related to flexibility

performance.

Large firms are associated with more resources than small firms. The fact that they can
dedicate more resources to integrating their suppliers gives them more leverage in
managing these relationships toward increased performance (Devaraj et al. 2007,
Koufteros et al. 2007). On the other hand, small firms, due to lower budgets and fewer
personnel, might seek more actively to integrate their suppliers and benefit from tight
supplier integration (Van Echtelt et al. 2007). Whether large firms integrate their suppliers
or customers to a higher degree than small firms is not well-established, as large firms also
tend to have more suppliers, products, and customer variety to manage. We therefore posit
that:

H3a. The interaction between supplier coordination and firm size is directly and

positively related to flexibility performance.

H4a. The interaction between customer coordination and firm size is directly and

positively related to flexibility performance.

In today’s environment, the ability to shorten the time between order placement and
order delivery can confer an important advantage as firms can more quickly react to
market conditions. In particular, firms in faster clockspeed industries require tighter
coordination with customers (Fine 1998). Similarly, the buying firm needs a quick reaction
from its suppliers, in order to satisfy its customers (Guimaraes et al. 2002). The pace at
which this reaction is solicited is more acute in faster clockspeed industries. We therefore
predict that:

H3b. The interaction between supplier coordination and clockspeed is directly and

positively related to flexibility performance.

H4b. The interaction between customer coordination and clockspeed is directly and

positively related to flexibility performance.

Supplier coordination and customer coordination could have equally important roles
in quality performance. For instance, Devaraj et al. (2007) found that supplier integration,
as supported by eBusiness technology, positively impacts quality in manufacturing firms.
In the context of high-tech industries, supplier involvement in NPD projects is found to
have a positive impact on the NPD project performance, operationalised as product cost,

conformance quality, design quality and time-to-market (Jayaram 2008). Interestingly,
Swink et al. (2007) hypothesised but could not find support for the positive associations
between supplier and customer integrations with quality. They provided two possible
explanations for such missing links. One explanation based on a resource-based view
argues that plants which place more emphasis on strategic supplier integration may indeed
see quality improvements, but they will improve quality at a slower rate than competitors
who may invest in other, more efficacious company-internal types of integration. A second
explanation is that supplier integration actually impedes improvements in quality
capability, as suppliers open themselves to adverse selection, moral hazard, and
opportunity cost as an agent to the principal manufacturer (Swink et al. 2007).

On the other hand, customer integration will help the manufacturer better understand
customer requirements and better forecast customer demand, thus allowing the manufac-
turer to provide better quality products at lower cost and more flexibly (Flynn et al. 2010).
Developing close relationships with customers requires identifying customers’ require-
ments, receiving feedback from customers, and conveying this feedback to employees
who can then execute changes based on the feedback (Kaynak and Hartley 2008).
Prior research indicates that information integration with customers is related to firm
performance (Frohlich and Westbrook 2001). In general, Ramdas and Spekman (2000)
suggested that poor coordination within a supply chain also has negative implications on
performance including quality. Similarly, Koufteros et al. (2005) found that both internal
and external integration positively influence product innovation and quality, and thus
profitability. Summarising from these theoretical underpinnings, we suggest that:

H5. Supplier coordination is directly and positively related to quality performance.

H6. Customer coordination is directly and positively related to quality performance.

Firm size is a strong indicator of corporate resources to economise the coordination
with supply chain members. A small firm may be unable to convince suppliers to adopt
a more collaborative posture and it may lack the skills and resources to develop
collaborative exchanges (Koufteros et al. 2007). Naturally, firm size would moderate the
roles of supplier coordination and customer coordination, as suggested in the extant
literature. For instance, Koufteros et al. (2007) found that some supplier integration is
more effective on quality when firms are large. In contrast, Devaraj et al. (2007) suggested
that the positive effects of supplier integration on cost, quality and flexibility are more
reflective of small to medium firms which formed 73% of the sample. At balance, we
conjecture that larger firms could utilise their scale economies to consolidate their supplier
efforts and customer focus to better achieve product quality:

H7a. The interaction between supplier coordination and firm size is directly and

positively related to quality performance.

H8a. The interaction between customer coordination and firm size is directly and

positively related to quality performance.

As mentioned above, the fast clockspeed achieved in delivering an order to customers
offers considerable benefits in the marketplace, but at the same time places substantial
requirements on the corporate resources. In particular, it is much harder to coordinate
with suppliers and customers to deliver high quality products in a fast clockspeed
environment, though a firm’s capability of doing so would offer itself significant
advantages over its competitors. For instance, Guimaraes et al. (2002) found that high

71

industry clockspeed significantly inhibits the relationship between the supplier relationship
depth and supplier network performance. In sum, we predict that:

H7b. The interaction between supplier coordination and clockspeed is directly and

positively related to quality performance.

H8b. The interaction between customer coordination and clockspeed is directly and

positively related to quality performance.

5. Research design and methodology

5.1 Survey design and pretest

they agreed or disagreed with each statement

We first developed and administered a survey in a small number of US firms and used the
results to revise the English version of the survey. The development of the survey and the
sampling procedures followed Churchill (1979) and Dillman (2000). Seven-point Likert
scales were used to measure survey responses. For instance, respondents were asked to
what extent
in the questionnaire
(1¼ ‘strongly disagree’ to 7¼ ‘strongly agree’). A pretest was conducted before the
questionnaire was finalised to reduce measurement error (Churchill 1979). The survey was
then translated into Chinese and pretested with a group of 20 MBA students and 10
managers participating in the executive programme in a top ranked university in China
with related-manufacturing work experiences. Their opinions and feedback were used to
revise and finalise the questionnaire design, which was then back-translated into English
to ensure the original meanings of the English version are maintained.

5.2 Survey approach and sample

Shanghai, the largest industrial city in China, has one of the most highly concentrated
manufacturing plants for many decades, and was thus selected as the base of this study.
Approximately 400 manufacturing-oriented companies were randomly selected with the
approval of Shanghai Association for Quality from its membership list which is composed
of more than 2000 firms in manufacturing, construction and service industries.
The association has periodically run various training programmes for its member
companies to introduce new quality management concepts or best practices, and is quite
reputable among its members. The survey questionnaire with the explicit approval from
the association office was thus believed to be viewed more positively by the member firms.
Production/operations managers,
coordination
programmes with suppliers and customers, are the best informants in this study.
The questionnaires along with postage-paid return envelopes were mailed to production/
operations managers in these companies as identified in the membership list. After two
weeks, 146 responses were received (within-city mails are usually received within 1–2 days).
Then the research team sent out a second mailing to the remaining ‘non-respondents’ and
received additional 51 completed surveys. This led to a total of 197 completed surveys,
representing a very encouraging response rate of about 49.25%.

In order to test for the presence of non-response bias, comparisons were made between
survey answers from early and late respondents (i.e., those that responded after the second

mailing was sent out) (Armstrong and Overton 1977). A multivariate t-test yielded no
significant mean difference between the early and late respondents at
the 0.05
significance level. This suggests the non-response bias is probably not present in this study.

5.3 Questionnaire and variables measurement

Consistent with previous studies (Ward et al. 1996, Shah and Ward 2003, Vickery et al.
2003), we used perceptual measures of operational performance. Scholars suggest that
perceptual measures of performance should be used when firms may be unwilling or
unable to provide objective financial measures. Areas of a firm’s operational strategy such
as supplier coordination or customer coordination are often integrative in nature and
also measured by multi-item scale (see Appendix for the description of survery items).

5.3.1 Dependent variables: flexibility performance and quality performance

In the questionnaire the respondents were asked to rate their factory’s performance,
relative to its major competitors with respect to: (1) product flexibility, (2) volume
flexibility, (3) process flexibility, (4) product reliability, (5) product durability, and (6)
quality (conformance to specifications). These items were measured on 7-point Likert scale
with 1¼ ‘poor’ to 7¼ ‘excellent’. The averages of the first three and the next three items
above were used to measure flexibility performance (Cronbach’s alpha¼ 0.7237) and
quality performance (Cronbach’s alpha¼ 0.8863), respectively.

5.3.2 Independent variables: supplier coordination and customer coordination

As previously mentioned, the items used to operationalise supplier coordination and
customer coordination respectively represent the basic conditions as reported in the
literature that the two types of coordination are built upon. For the supplier coordination
construct, respondents were asked to indicate the degree of agreement with certain
statements about quality goals with respect to any factory or plant that the respondents’
unit had responsibility. In particular, supplier coordination was measured by the average
response score in: (1) ‘we strive to establish long-term relationships with suppliers’, (2)
‘quality is our number one criterion in selecting suppliers’, and (3) ‘we rely on a small
number of high-quality suppliers’ (Cronbach’s alpha¼ 0.7671).

Customer coordination was measured by the average response score in: (1) ‘we
frequently are in close contact with our customers’, (2) ‘our customers OFTEN visit our
plant’ (reverse-coded as ‘SELDOM visit’
in the actual questionnaire), and (3) ‘our
customers give us
(Cronbach’s
alpha¼ 0.6242). These items were measured on 7-point Likert scale with 1¼ ‘strongly
disagree’ to 7¼ ‘strongly agree’.

feedback on quality and delivery performance’

We recognise that our questionnaire items above do not cover every aspect of
coordination such as those involving the speed and convenience of information exchange.
Rather, our measures focus on the relationship-related aspects of coordination. Still, all
dependent and independent variables displayed composite reliability values (Fornell and
Larcker 1981) in excess of the 0.60 minimum cut-off value for exploratory studies (Van de
Ven and Ferry 1978, Churchill 1979, Flynn et al. 1990).

5.3.3 Control/contingency variables: firm size and clockspeed

Two objective measures were used to control for performance effects. As in most other
studies, firm size may delineate the difference in firm performance. Firm size was measured
by the annual sales revenue (for the most recent year) for the factory concerned. The
natural logarithm of it is used as the measure of firm size here as commonly adopted.

Another control variable, order cycle time – ‘how long (in days) does it take to
complete a typical unit of your primary finished product, from date of customer order to
date of customer shipment’ – is an important supply chain parameter that all parties
involved are concerned about. Its natural logarithm is used to represent the clockspeed.
All dependent, independent and control variables are standardised (subtracted from
the mean and then divided by the standard deviation of the original) before interaction
terms between independent and control variables are created, as suggested in Aiken and
West (1991, p. 28–47). This eases the interpretation of results substantially. Tables 2 and 3
present the summary statistics and correlation matrix of the original variables.

6. Statistical analysis

The hypotheses associated with the model presented in Figure 1 were tested using multiple
regression procedure with contingency effects (see, for instance, Aiken and West 1991).
The results for the flexibility performance equation are presented in Table 4, while those
for the quality performance equation are presented in Table 5. Overall, our model results
are highly significant, as indicated by the R-square values and F-statistics in both
equations.

In order to test our hypotheses, a hierarchical regression approach is adopted to
examine the importance of each of the independent variables and control variables
(Tabachnick and Fidell 1996). First, the independent variables representing supplier
coordination and customer coordination are entered (see first columns labelled Model 1 in
Tables 4 and 5). Then the control variable representing firm size and its interactions with
supplier coordination and customer coordination are entered in sequence (see Models 2
and 3, respectively). This allows us to study the contingency effects of firm size which may

moderate the effectiveness of a plant’s supplier and customer coordination programmes
as hypothesised earlier. Similarly, the control variable representing clockspeed and its
interactions with supplier coordination and customer coordination are entered in sequence
(see Models 4 and 5, respectively). In all regression model analyses, the variance inflation
factors were found to be close to 1 (less than 1.5), thus indicating that multi-collinearity
among independent and control variables was not a problem.

As can be seen in Model 2 of Table 4, supplier coordination displayed a significant
influence on flexibility performance, thus providing support for H1. Similarly, Model 2 of
Table 5 showed that supplier coordination is significantly related to quality performance
providing strong support for H5. Taken together, these results empirically demonstrate the
importance of supplier coordination in predicting flexibility performance and quality
performance.

As regards customer coordination, Model 2 of Table 4 showed a moderate effect on
flexibility performance, thus providing support for H2. Similarly, Model 2 of Table 5
showed that customer coordination is significantly related to quality performance
providing strong support for H6. As similarly mentioned above, these results empirically
demonstrate the importance of customer coordination in predicting flexibility performance
and quality performance.

In Models 3 and 5 of Table 4, we examined the moderating effect of firm size and
clockspeed by adding the corresponding interaction terms. The additions of interaction
terms were overall significant as the increase in R-square over Model 2; respectively Model
4 was statistically significant (F-value). However, some individual parameter estimates
were not statistically significant. We interpreted this highly conservatively to indicate lack
of support for H3a, H4a and H4b. That is, firm size and clockspeed do not appear to fully
moderate the effect of supplier coordination and customer coordination on flexibility
performance. However, a detailed evaluation of individual effects shows a clearer picture.
Hypothesis H3a stated that the interaction of supplier coordination and firm size was
positively related to flexibility performance. As can be seen from the beta coefficient
(Model 3, Table 4), this hypothesis was not supported. However, hypothesis H4a, which
stated that the interaction of customer coordination and firm size was positively related
to flexibility performance, was not supported in terms of directionality (moderately
statistically significant but in the opposite direction). Also, H3b stated that the interaction
between supplier coordination and clockspeed was positively related to flexibility
performance. The corresponding beta coefficient
for this
hypothesis. However, H4b, according to which the interaction between customer
coordination and clockspeed was positively related to flexibility performance, was not
supported.

indicated strong support

With regards to Table 5, in Models 3 and 5 we examined the moderating effect of firm
size and clockspeed by adding the corresponding interaction terms. Again, using the
F-value of increase in R-square, the additions of interaction terms were significant. The
statistical significance of increases in R-square over Model 2, respectively Model 4, could
have provided broad support for H7a, H8a, H7b and H8b. However, similar to the previous
case, the individual effects were not significant,
indicating thus that firm size and
clockspeed do not fully moderate the effect of supplier coordination and customer
coordination on quality performance. However, a clearer picture is detailed by the
evaluation of individual effects.

Hypothesis H7a stated that the interaction of supplier coordination and firm size
was positively related to quality performance. As can be seen from the beta coefficient

(Model 3, Table 5), this hypothesis was not supported in terms of directionality
(moderately statistically significant but in the opposite direction). Similarly, hypothesis
H8a, which stated that the interaction of customer coordination and firm size was
positively related to quality performance, was not supported. Also, H7b and H8b stated
that the interactions between supplier coordination, respectively customer coordination,
and clockspeed were positively related to quality performance. As can be seen from beta
coefficients, both hypotheses were not supported.

7. Discussion

In this paper, we investigated the effects of two types of coordination on plant
performance in the Chinese context. More specifically, we examined the effects of supplier
coordination and customer coordination on two dimensions of performance,
i.e.,
flexibility and quality. Our results confirmed the positive impact of supplier coordination
on flexibility performance found by Devaraj et al. (2007). That is, supplier coordination
enhances a firm’s ability to handle non-standard orders that impact the manufacturing
process, especially when the demand is increasing. Our results show that supplier
coordination influences quality performance, thus confirming previous studies (Koufteros
et al. 2005, Devaraj et al. 2007). This is particularly important for Chinese manufacturers,
taking into account the harsh criticism with respect to the recent recalls of products made
in China.

impact on quality through the effects on product

Whereas Koufteros et al.’s (2005) study indicated that customer coordination has an
innovation; our study
indirect
demonstrates a direct impact on quality performance. Similarly, as predicted, customer
coordination was found to influence flexibility performance. The collaboration between a
firm and its customer reduces production uncertainty, making the firm more responsive to
customer demands. Thus, our most important contribution in this study is that both forms
of coordination, i.e., supplier coordination and customer coordination are positively and
significantly important affecting both quality and flexibility performance. This is also
consistent with Fisher’s (1997) work that both forms of coordination typify different
supply chain configurations. The positive effect on quality performance is typical of a
functional supply chain, whereas the positive effects on flexibility performance are typical
of a responsive supply chain. The fact that these relationships held true in China represents
the second most important contribution of this research. Although Fisher’s (1997) and
subsequent research on functional and innovative supply chains were largely restricted to
the North American context, our study confirms that coordination upstream and
downstream are indeed important in the Chinese contexts as well.

Another research objective was to verify if the relationships between the two types of
coordination and the two dimensions of performance were contingent upon firm size or
clockspeed. In other words, do large firms have an advantage in better leveraging
coordination mechanisms on performance? The interaction between supplier coordination
and size was directly and negatively related to quality performance. This suggests that for
small Chinese manufacturers, effective supplier coordination mechanisms pay off via good
quality performance. However, the same is not true for an influence on flexibility
performance. Interestingly, the interaction between customer coordination and size was
directly and negatively related to flexibility performance. This suggests that in small
Chinese firms, deployment of customer coordination mechanisms enhances flexibility

performance. This makes sense as firms that are small and desirous of occupying niche
segments should integrate well with customer requirements in order to compete with
corresponding large-sized competitors. The arena for such competition may not be in
quality performance which is expected but with respect to flexibility performance thereby
creating a niche advantage.

The results with respect to the contingency influence of clockspeed were also
interesting. The interaction between supplier coordination and clockspeed was directly and
positively related to only flexibility performance but not quality performance. Our results
suggest that clockspeed strongly altered the effect of supplier coordination on flexibility
performance. This suggests that a manufacturing firm may be more able to improve
flexibility performance through supplier coordination under a slower clockspeed than
under a fast clockspeed. This makes sense since in a slow-clockspeed environment;
partnership-style supplier relations could prove to be more efficient and more flexible than
the arm’s-length trading relationship (Guimaraes et al. 2002). Customer coordination
appears to be equally important in high and low clockspeed firms. Our results also did not
indicate moderating effects for clockspeed on either the relationship between supplier
coordination and quality performance, or the relationships between customer coordina-
tion and flexibility performance.

It is interesting to note that, as a post hoc analysis, we examined whether the two types
of coordination of supplier coordination and customer coordination had a combined and
joint
influence on both quality and flexibility performance (Tables 6 and 7).
The interaction effects of supplier coordination and customer coordination were not
statistically significant on either the quality or flexibility performance. This suggests that
the type and form of coordination in the upstream supplier side is different from the type
and form of coordination on the downstream customer side. Together, they do not explain
any additional variance over and above their main effects on performance.

7.1 Theoretical contributions

In summary, our results indicate strong main effects of coordination on performance as
well as some interesting contingency effects of size and clockspeed on the coordination-
performance relationships. Although the body of knowledge on supply chain coordination
with respect to China is only now emerging, it is interesting to report that our study is one
of the first to report strong empirical support for the effective use of supplier and customer
coordination influencing quality performance (which is crucial in functional supply chains)
and influencing flexibility performance (which is critical in responsive supply chains).
In both these types of supply chains, it is not only important to have effective supply chain
coordination upstream (supplier) but it is also important to have effective supply chain
coordination downstream (customer). Of the two contingency variables, size displayed
a more detailed pattern in the coordination-performance relationships as compared to
clockspeed.

7.2 Managerial contributions

Our research has important implications for global supply chain managers, especially
those who have interests in the context of the Chinese manufacturing sector. For firms that
are starting off, they may benefit from the global nature of our findings in that both forms

of coordination mechanisms are equally important. These managers can use our items
constituting supplier coordination and customer coordination as an audit tool to gauge
where their respective firms stay with respect to those initiatives. For firms that are further
along and would like to benchmark other firms on size or clockspeed, our contingency
results may be useful. It appears that our size effects are more robust, thereby facilitating

external benchmarking of similar firms (if the focal firm and benchmarking firm are large)
or of different firms (if the focal firm is small and the benchmark firm is large and vice
versa). With respect to clockspeed our results are less robust as we only found one
statistically significant interaction effect.

8. Conclusions

This research contributed to the academic literature of coordination and contingency
theories in the emerging economy of China. Specifically, we highlighted the importance of
both forms of coordination, supplier and customer, for both types of supply chains,
functional and innovative, and in the context of China. Our research also offered fine
grained analyses along the contextual condition of large versus small size firms as well as
along the contextual condition of fast versus slow clockspeed firms. We also made several
significant managerial recommendations to firms desirous of integrating global supply
chains that extend to (or start in) China.

Our research is not without limitations. As ours is one of the earliest studies to examine
contingency issues pertaining to the coordination-performance relationships in China, it is
not surprising that we did not find a consistent set of results with respect to size and even
less with respect to clockspeed. Future research can tackle these issues on a more
comprehensive basis. Also, we were limited in our items that we could include to capture
coordination mechanisms as empirical data collection in China continues to be a
challenge. For instance, our survey did not cover every aspect of coordination such as
those involving the speed and convenience of information exchange. Instead, we focused
more on the relationship-related aspects of coordination. Also, we used perceptual data in
our survey as opposed to the more desirable objective data. Nevertheless, we do not believe
that this subjectivity is a cause of unreliability in the interpretation of our results.

Our research can be extended in several ways. Other emerging economies such as
Brazil, India and Russia can be used as the context in which the coordination-performance
relationships are examined. Newer contextual variables such as experience of the firm,
product type and environmental complexity can be examined. Other multidimensional
aspects of coordination such as information technology coordination or technology
coordination can be separately examined. Attempts can also be made to obtain externally
generated objective data to obviate the common method variance problem.
