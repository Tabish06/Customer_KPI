Relating TQM, marketing and business performance: an exploratory
study

ANGEL R. MARTINEZ-LORENTE{*, FRANK. W. DEWHURST{
and ALEJANDRINO GALLEGO-RODRIGUEZ{

Total Quality Management (TQM) is perhaps the leading management approach
that companies employ to improve their product and service quality with the aim
of improving typical measures of business performance (e.g. increased pro® ts,
increased market share, reduced costs). However, consumer perception of quality
not only results from an evaluation of the intrinsic quality attributes of the prod-
uct (e.g. performance, reliability, durability) but is also a ected by the marketing
mix (e.g. price, advertising, warranties) adopted by the company selling the prod-
uct. This paper o ers a ® rst attempt at cross-functional fertilization by examining
the relationships between TQM, some marketing mix variables and measures of
company performance by exploring the diverse multidisciplinary literature and
developing an explanatory framework, which is tested using non-parametric cor-
relation and re® ned through an empirical study of Spanish manufacturing com-
panies. The results show that the most important TQM dimensions are the system
of employee relations and the use of quality management-related design tools.
The results also indicate the existence of a relationship amongst price, advertising
and warranties, but that these marketing variables were not related to TQM
and that further research is required to include a wider de® nition of marketing
strategy.

Introduction
Quality is regarded by most producers as one of the most important aspects of
for example,
manufacturing, service and purchasing strategies. Several studies,
Aaker and Jacobson (1994), Anderson et al. (1994), Buzzell et al. (1975), Capon et
al. (1990), Craig and Douglas (1982), Farris and Reibstein (1979), Jacobson and
Aaker (1987), McGuire et al. (1990) and Phillips et al. (1983) have reported that
perceived product quality is related to increased sales and pro® ts and consumers
make their purchase decisions in relation to perceived quality (Gale and Buzzell
1989). However, what is perceived product quality? According to Garvin (1988), it
is one of eight dimensions that shape the quality concept, the others are: perform-
ance, features, reliability, conformance, durability, aesthetics and serviceability (the
intrinsic attributes or physical characteristics of a product). Intrinsic attributes can
be improved in two ways: o ering improved performance, additional features, etc
(which has a clear cost implication) and by applying Total Quality Management
(TQM), which not only improves conformance levels but also has a positive impact
on other quality dimensions (Flynn et al., 1995).

A. R. Martinez-L orente et al.

Feigenbaum (1983) and Ishikawa (1985) propose that TQM is the best approach
to quality management, and authors such as Crosby (1987) and Dale and Plunkett
(1995) claim that TQM can lead not only to increases in quality but also to reduc-
tions in costs. Some studies, for example, American Quality Foundation (1991),
Hendricks and Singhal (1996, 1997), Kano et al.
(1983), Larry (1993), National
Institute of Standards and Technology (1998), US General Accounts O ce (1991),
and Wisner and Eakins (1994) have shown the existence of a positive relationship
between TQM and company performance whilst, others, for example, Fisher (1992),
Fuchsberg (1993a, 1993b), Mathews (1992) and Naj (1993) report TQM failures.
However, these studies only considered relationships between TQM and company
performance, but not the contribution of individual TQM dimensions. Adam (1994),
Adam et al. (1997), Anderson et al. (1995), Flynn et al. (1995), Forker (1997), Ittner
and Larcker (1997) and Powell
(1995) have considered how di erent quality
improvement practices are related to company performance. However, there is a

lack of agreement in the ® ndings and some results are contradictory with TQM
theories, as shown in table 1.

A full discussion of the dimensions constituting TQM that have appeared in the
literature can be found in Martinez-Lorente et al. (1998a) whilst Martinez-Lorente et
al.
(1998b) present seven common dimensions for measuring TQM as shown in
table 2.

The intrinsic attributes of a product are not the only determinants of consumer
demand (Kuehn and Day 1962, Zeithaml 1988). Consumer quality perceptions are
in¯ uenced by marketing mix variables (Boulding and Kirmani 1993, Gotlied and
Sarel 1992, Zeithaml 1988) and constitute one of the basic elements in the de® nition
of a company marketing strategy. A marketing strategy requires decisions on the
target market and the marketing mix (i.e. pricing, distribution, sales force, advertis-
ing and sales promotion, and product design) (Kotler 1980). Thus, perceived quality
results from consumer evaluation of intrinsic attributes and their interpretation of
extrinsic attributes (i.e. price, advertising, warranties, country of origin and store
image) (Darby and Karni 1973, Garvin 1988, Nelson 1970, Zeithaml 1988).

In this paper, only price, advertising and warranties have been chosen for analy-
sis because they were thought to be the primary marketing variables that might be
related to TQM and because they have received the majority of attention in the
literature. Although there are some studies relating perceived quality with retailer

The primary responsibility for leading the drive to improve
quality is that of senior management. The incentives should be
based on groups rather than individuals and has to give more
weight to quality. Other issues include the importance given to
training and the use of improvement teams and suggestion
schemes.
Existence of a high level of cleanliness and organization of tools,
® xtures and the workplace. The position of the quality
department in the organization has to demonstrate independence.
Application of quality management system standards and the
implementation of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM).
A well developed and understood new product development and
design (NPDD) process and e ective co-ordination amongst the
di erent departments involved in NPDD have to be implemented.
This includes a system of internal audits, measurement of the
quality management system, management review data and
information availability.
Use of a small number of suppliers. Use of detailed requirements,
which suppliers have to follow as speci® ed by the quality
management system standard. Participation of the supplier in the
NPDD process. Supplier selection according to quality criterion.
Use of appropriate statistical and non-statistical tools in the
continuous improvement process.
Use of appropriate tools and techniques in the process of
designing a new product and/or a new process.

reputation (e.g. Wheatley and Chiu 1977, Dodds et al. 1991 and Rao and Monroe
1989), this subject has not received as much attention as price, warranties and
advertising. Furthermore, although sales force, publicity, and distribution are im-
portant marketing variables they are not employed by all companies and it was the
purpose of this preliminary cross-sectional study to be as general as possible.

The way in which price, advertising and warranties impinge on the perceived
quality for a particular company will depend on how they are used and deployed by
competing companies. These variables are also employed by the consumer to make
comparisons between di erent brands.

Table 3 summarizes the theoretical and empirical studies that have examined the
relationship between perceived quality and the external attributes considered in this
paper (i.e. advertising, price and warranties) using a three part categorizationÐ
`in
favour of the existence of’, `in favour only in certain cases’, or `against such an
impact’. Many authors consider that consumers use price as a quality indicator, at
least in certain cases, however, Caves and Green (1996), Curry (1985), Curry and
Riesz (1988), Dardis and Gieser (1980), Geistfeld (1982), Gerstner (1985), Hjorth-
Andersen (1991), Sproles (1977) and Tellis and Wernerfelt (1987) have found that

price is not a good indicator of intrinsic quality. A higher price may indicate better
quality (e.g. a designer fashion label) and may motivate purchasers but it may also
discourage them. Some companies appear to use high prices to indicate high quality
although their product quality may be no better than that of their competitors and
consumers may also use advertising and warranties to infer quality.

2. A framework linking TQM, extrinsic attributes and performance

Figure 1 illustrates a proposed framework to represent the possible relationships
between TQM, price, advertising and warranties and their e ects on unit cost of
production, growth in market share and operational pro® ts. Growth in market share
and unit cost of production were chosen as measures of performance because the use
of speci® c quality management measures such as `rate of defects’, omits relevant
details (e.g. investment in TQM) and ® nancial measures, such as share prices, are
a ected by other factors (e.g. interest rates), which are not related to TQM policy.
The hypotheses underpinning this framework model are presented and discussed

below.

H1. Marketing mix variables are mutually interrelated

The existence of a relationship between price, advertising and warranties would
indicate that companies use them jointly; that is to say, when a company establishes
a high price it spends more on advertising and/or on warranties and vice versa. The
reason for this could be that when consumers use the extrinsic attributes of a product
to infer and judge its quality, companies act accordingly and use these extrinsic

attributes to present the image that their products are superior. Farris and Reibstein
(1979) demonstrated that companies with consistent pricing and advertising strate-
gies produced higher returns on investment than companies with inconsistent stra-
tegies.

H2. No clear relationship between T QM dimensions and marketing variables

A positive relationship between TQM and price, advertising and warranties
could indicate that those companies that make considerable e orts in improving
quality communicate this to consumers by means of extrinsic attributes and, at
the same time, aim to obtain increased prices for their products. However, better
quality products may need less extrinsic attributes in order to sell, therefore, com-
panies who produce better quality products may use extrinsic attributes to a lesser
in this case, the relationship between TQM and extrinsic attributes
degree and,
would be negative. Moreover,
it is not unusual to ® nd a lack of coordination
between marketing and production departments, with the marketing strategy
being decided by the marketing department and the TQM policy being the respon-
sibility of production departments.

H3. Marketing variables are related to market share growth

(1) Advertising is positively related to market share growth through a positive

relationship with perceived quality.

(2) Warranties are positively related to market share growth through a positive

relationship with perceived quality.

(3) Price does not have a relationship with market share growth.

As perceived quality not only depends on physical attributes but also on marketing
strategy then price, advertising and warranties should have a positive relationship
with perceived quality. Price also has a positive relationship with consumer expen-
diture. Neither perceived quality nor consumer expenditure have been assessed in the
analysis and are therefore latent variables in the framework. If perceived quality has
a positive relationship with market share growth, then advertising and warranties
should have a positive relationship with market share growth. Thus, the expected
e ect of price (in the normal range of prices) on market share growth is null, since
the negative e ect of perceived expenditure counteracts the positive e ect of per-
ceived quality on market share growth. This lack of relationship would not be
expected to exist for any price because extremely high prices imply reductions in
market share.

H4. TQM is positively related to market share growth through a positive

relationship with intrinsic quality attributes

Adam (1994), Adam et al. (1997) and Flynn et al. (1995) have shown that TQM
helps to improve intrinsic quality through reduced defect rates and better design. In
addition, intrinsic quality (another latent variable in the model) has a positive e ect
on consumer perceptions of quality (Flynn et al. 1995), and that perceived quality
has a positive e ect on growth in market share (Jacobson and Aaker 1987 and
Phillips et al. 1983).


Rotating T QM, marketing and business performance

3233

H5. TQM is negatively related to unit production cost

TQM is claimed to contribute to reduced costs (e.g. Adam 1994, Adam et al.

1997, Crosby 1987 and Dale and Plunkett 1995).

H6. Higher production costs are not positively related to market share growth

Better design characteristics (intrinsic attributes) may require increasing the cost
of the product. They also imply improved perceived quality and, consequently, may
imply an improvement in market share growth. However, di erences in costs are not
only due to di erences in attributes but also to di erences in e ciency. Moreover,
when higher quality is achieved with more intrinsic attributes and, therefore, an
increase in costs, a higher market share need not follow because the increase in
price needed to maintain the bene® t counteracts the e ect of higher quality. Thus,
a null
(neither negative nor positive) relationship between production cost and
market share is expected.

H7. Market share growth and unit production costs are related to operational

pro® ts

(1) Market share growth is positively related to operational pro® ts.
(2) Unit production costs are negatively related to operational pro® ts.

The operational pro® ts of companies are clearly dependent upon sales and costs.
Therefore, companies with larger market share growth (Buzzell et al. 1975) and with
smaller unit costs (Phillips et al. 1983) will obtain better operational pro® ts.

3. Research methodolog y

The population comprised industrial companies with factories located in Spain.
Industrial companies were chosen because the problems faced in the management of
quality by service companies are di erent (Dale et al. 1997, Benson et al. 1991). A list
of the 3000 largest Spanish companies by annual sales turnover is published by the
organization `Fomento de la ProduccioÂ n’ of which 1105 were surveyed. The target
respondents of the questionnaire were general managers, because they should be the
TQM leaders in their respective companies. When the name of the general manager
was not known, the questionnaire was addressed to `responsable de calidad’ (quality
leader) and the ® rst question asked for the position of the respondent in the com-
pany.

The questionnaire response rate was 20.2% (223 companies), and this is compar-
able to those of recent operations management studies by Mehra and Inman (1992),
Small and Yasin (1997) and Vickery et al. (1997). The majority of the questionnaires
were answered by quality managers (63.1%) ; other major respondents were general
managers (26%), quality department representatives (6.6%) and sta members
(5.1%). Variance analysis indicates that the position of the respondents did not
a ect the responses. Correlations between the number of companies in each sector
of the population and the number of companies in each industry of the sample were
positive and signi® cant (r
0.000), indicating that the sample repre-
sented the sectors analysed. Some 45% of the companies in the sample are made
up of foreign companies, mainly of European, United States and Japanese origin, as
shown in table 4.

(Gallego Rodriguez and Martinez Lorente 1994) and was subjected to a formal pre-
test involving three quality managers and one quality consultant of a local chamber
of commerce in Spain and then critically reviewed by six professors of management
at the University of Murcia, who were outside the research team. All questions were
answered in relation to the main product of the company with subjective opinions
requested. Dess and Robinson (1984) and Pearce et al. (1987) demonstrated a high
correlation between subjective opinions and precise data and it was recognized that
precise data could not be obtained due to the di erent de® nitions of ® nancial criteria
employed by companies and industrial sectors. Therefore, respondents were asked to
indicate their opinions about how their respective organizations compared to the
competition, in relation to:

(a) unit cost of manufacturing during the past 5 years;
(b) earnings before interest and tax over sales (EBIT/S) during the past 5 years;
(c) advertising expenditure;
(d) price of the product;
(e) the warranties o ered;

Respondents were also asked to indicate their opinions on the variation of the
market share of their company during the past 5 years.

The design of a construct using a similar methodology to that of Ahire et al.
(1996), Flynn et al. (1994) and Saraph et al. (1989) was chosen to assess the devel-
opment of TQM employing the seven TQM dimensions described in table 2.

Employee Relations (ER), Organisation (O), Product Design Process (PDP),
Quality Information (QI) and Supplier relationships (SR) were measured on a
® ve-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), whilst Process
Instruments (PI) and Design Instruments (DI) were measured on a 0 to 5 scale,
with 0 (do not use the instrument), 1 (use the instrument at a low level) and 5 (use
the instrument at a high level). The average of the points obtained in each question

for each dimension was computed. The reliability of each TQM dimension was
measured using the internal consistency method, as described by Bohrnstedt
(1970). Items that reduce the total Cronbach’s alpha were eliminated in order to
maximize reliability. Typically, reliability coe cients of 0.7 or more are considered
adequate; however, coe cients of 0.6 can be accepted for new scales (Nunnally
1978). Thus, a decision was taken to accept (with some reservations) those dimen-
sions with Cronbach’s alpha from 0.6 to 0.7.

Except for Supplier Relationship (SR), with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.57, all other
dimensions were found to have an alpha between 0.88 and 0.67 and, therefore, the
Supplier Relationship (SR) dimension was omitted from the analysis. The low alpha
for the Supplier Relationship (SR) dimension could be due to small companies
having di culties in encouraging suppliersÐ who are often large organizations for
whom the supplier business represents only a small proportion of their salesÐ
to
apply a speci® c tool, technique and/or system. It is also equally problematic for a
small company to involve large organization suppliers in the NPDD process (Spring
et al. 1998). Therefore, small companies committed to TQM can only apply elements
of this dimension that do not depend on the decisions of their suppliers.

Two criteria, content validity and construct validity, were employed as proposed
by Bohrnstedt (1970), Campbell and Fiske (1959) and Magnusson (1976). Content
validity tests if the scale used is based on related theory. The scale used encompassed
the dimensions that constitute TQM and selection of the measurement items was
based on an exhaustive review of the literature (Martinez Lorente 1997). Construct
validity indicates the degree to which all the questions in a scale measure the same
construct and several procedures can be applied (Bagozzi et al. 1991). Factor analysis
was employed to determine if more than one explanatory factor existed for each
dimension, and con® rmed that the items of each dimension were loaded on a single
factor (with eigenvalue > 1) indicating that each dimension measured only one facet
of TQM. Finally, an element of construct validityÐ
convergent validityÐ was also
considered. This measures the degree to which the di erent dimensions, into which
the construct is divided, are positively correlated amongst themselves (i.e. dimen-
sions that belong to the same construct are expected to be highly correlated). The
correlations obtained were all positive and signi® cant at p < 0.05.

After

con® rming reliability and validity, and suppressing the Supplier
Relationship dimension, the levels of each TQM dimension for each company
were calculated. The means and standard deviations of the obtained values are
given in table 6 and summary statistics for the measures of performance and market-
ing mix variables are given in table 7.

In order to contrast the existence of each proposed relationship, Kendall’s tau-c
was employed (Kendall and Gibbons 1990) because the data comprised ranked

dimensions using a 1 to 5 point scale (each point being 1/5th of the range of each
dimension) was performed in order to transform these to ranked variables.

4. Results and discussion

Each of the relationships presented in ® gure 1 is examined below, under four

main headings, in the light of the survey results.

4.1. Marketing mix variables and T QM dimensions

Table 8 shows Kendall’s tau-c values for the relationships between price, adver-
tising, warranties and the TQM dimensions. A positive relationship exists between
the three extrinsic marketing mix variables, suggesting that companies use them all
to a similar degree. This appears to support hypothesis H1 that companies maintain
a consistent marketing strategy in relation to price, advertising and warranties. The
relationship of price with advertising and warranties could also be due to the fact
that expenditures in the latter are translated to the price of the product. This result
was expected, as marketing departments do not make decisions on the marketing
mix variables in isolation, and it further con® rms the validity of the survey responses.
However there is a lack of a general relationship between the three extrinsic
variables and the TQM dimensions, as predicted in hypothesis H2. No relationship
was found between advertising and any of the TQM dimensions; the only signi® cant
relationships were between PDP and warranties and between O and price. The
former could mean that companies who have an e ective design process are more
con® dent in the reliability of their products and, consequently, can o er more
extended warranties. The latter suggests that companies might believe that invest-
ments in the O dimension (e.g. the application of a quality management system

standard) can be recovered with a higher price due to the improved quality.
However, applying the same logic, more positive relationships would have been
expected. For example, because PDP has a relationship with warranties, then so
should DI, since the use of these tools and techniques can improve reliability.
Thus, whilst the marketing mix strategy of the responding companies reveals a
general concordance of the three variables of price, advertising and warranties,
this strategy is not generally related to the factors, which constitute the TQM
dimensions. There could be two main reasons for this ® nding.

(a) Although TQM should be applied company wide, frequently it is restricted
to production departments, and a lack of communication and coordination
between production and marketing departments would explain the lack of
linkage between TQM and marketing strategies.

(b) It is possible that some companies try to reinforce their TQM e orts with a
marketing policy that communicates to consumers the improvements made
and then they increase prices,
increase expenditure on advertising and
extend warranties. On the other hand, it is also possible that companies
may make the most of the improved quality achieved and consequently
reduce expenditures on advertising and warranties as this is no longer
necessary to convince consumers of superior quality. Moreover, they may
also make the most of the reduced cost achieved with such a policy and
reduce prices accordingly.

4.2. Marketing variables, unit costs and market share growth

Table 9 shows the relationship of the marketing variables and unit cost with
market share growth. The results indicate that advertising a ects market share
growth but that price, warranties and unit costs do not. Therefore, hypothesis
H3.1 was con® rmed and again supports evidence elsewhere in the literature. This
does not mean that companies should invest unreservedly in advertising, since adver-
tising also has a cost.

The lack of a relationship between price and market share growth supports
hypothesis H3.3: the negative e ect of price on the purchase decision may be coun-
teracted by the positive e ect on product quality image. As stated in the explanation
of hypothesis H3.3, this is limited to normal prices and prices are generally normal
due to the fact that companies set prices in relation to competitors. It is only when
price moves outside the normal range that it has value as a marketing tool.

The fact that warranties did not appear to have relevance refutes hypothesis
H3.2. This ® nding appears to concord with that of Boulding and Kirmani (1993),
who found that a high warranty is bene® cial only to the high-credibility ® rm and not
for example, Cooper and Ross (1985),
to the low-credibility ® rm. Other researchersÐ

rational indicator of product quality. Therefore, if low credibility ® rms o er high
warranties, they will not obtain a higher market share.

4.3. T QM dimensions, unit costs and market share growth

Table 10 shows the Kendall’s tau-c for the relationships between the TQM
dimensions and market share growth and unit costs. Only ER and DI have a sig-
ni® cant relationship with market share growth, and only ER showed a signi® cant
relationship with unit costs. Therefore, hypotheses H4 and H5 have been only par-
tially con® rmed. Although this ® nding is not in accordance with TQM theory, it has
similarities with previous research ® ndings. Adam (1994), Anderson et al. (1995) and
Powell (1995) did not ® nd any relationship between most of their TQM dimensions
and measures of company performance, except for those related to workforce man-
agement. Adam et al. (1997) found that the factors positively related to ® nancial
performance were `senior management involvement’ and `employee compensation
and recognition’, both of which are included in the ER dimension. Flynn et al. (1995)
reported that TQM dimensions related to the PDP were regarded as most important
to achieve high perceived quality.

The lack of a relationship between O, QI, PI and DI and performance is counter-
intuitive and cannot be explained by the literature and might be explained by incor-
rect application of TQM tools and practices. Dale and Lightburn (1992) and
Wheeler (1994) have reported several examples of misunderstandings about the
application of SPC (Statistical Process Control).

4.4. Market share growth and unit costs related to Operational Pro® ts

No signi® cant relationship was found between unit production costs and market
share growth, con® rming hypothesis H6 (see table 9). Since a positive and signi® cant
relationship (tau-c
0.00) between price and unit cost was found, then
higher cost and higher prices are related.

5. Conclusions

This paper has explored three phenomenaÐ TQM, marketing mix and measures
of business performanceÐ based on empirical research in Spanish manufacturing
companies. The concept of perceived quality (before and after purchase) was
examined by reference to the diverse marketing and quality management literature
and relates not only to intrinsic product characteristics but also includes external
attributes. A framework model was developed and tested to examine relationships
amongst and between six TQM dimensions (Employee Relationships, Organization,
Product Design Process, Quality Information, Supplier Relationships, Process
Instruments and Design Instruments),
(price,
advertising and warranties) and three measures of company performance (market
share growth and production costs per unit and operational pro® ts (EBIT/S)). The
relationships were examined using non-parametric correlation analysis to o er a ® rst
attempt at cross-functional fertilization between TQM, marketing mix variables and
measures of business performance. This is an important issue because the results of
TQM should be analysed in a wider context (i.e. in relation to overall company
strategy).

three marketing mix variables

With respect to price, advertising and warranties, the results con® rm what would
be expected, that companies use them jointly as part of a marketing strategy. The
analysis of the relationship of these marketing mix variables with market share
growth showed that only advertising had a positive e ect. On the other hand,
price was found to have no relationship with market share growth, indicating that
its e ect as a quality indicator counterbalances its e ect as a disincentive to sales.
Warranties appear to be an unimportant variable with respect to growth in market
share.

No relationships between external attributes and TQM dimensions were found.
This supports anecdotal evidence of a lack of functional integration between opera-
tions and marketing departments and may also result from companies de® ning their


3240

strategy in relation to external and internal attributes according to the characteristics
of the di erent markets, as suggested by Hill (1985). Further research to analyse the
company behaviour in di erent markets and circumstances could clarify this.

The only TQM dimensions that showed a positive and signi® cant relationship
with market share growth were Employee Relations and Design Instruments. Only
Employee Relations had a negative and signi® cant relationship with unit cost in
relation to competitors. This ® nding, supported by previous research (e.g. Adam
1994, Adam et al., 1997, Anderson et al. 1995, Flynn et al. 1995 and Powell 1995),
appears to indicate that the key elements of a TQM policy are workforce manage-
ment and the use of quality management-related design tools.

The implications for management are clear. First, management should examine
the relationships between their marketing and operations departments and analyse
whether their company marketing mix strategy ® ts with their TQM policy and how
this relates to the overall company strategy. Second, they should recognize that
workforce management is the primary driver of TQM and they should also examine
whether the TQM tools and practices are being correctly implemented. A corollary is
that there may also be some merit in examining the relationships between the Human
Resource Management and operations departments to ensure that workforce
management practices are supporting TQM policies and that employees have
appropriate skills to implement these policies, practices and tools.

The study is not without its limitations. The data obtained are perceptual data,
with all the associated problems. Future studies including objective data would be
interesting and further work should be undertaken to include additional data. In
particular, additional elements of marketing (e.g. market position, sales promotions,
publicity and distribution) should be considered and the measurement of quality in
the eyes of the consumers would be of value. It would also be useful to analyse the
di erences between industries, since the use and e ect of marketing variables might
exhibit di erent e ects. Longitudinal research to consider the time lags of the e ect
of TQM on performance would also be of value (Reed et al. 1996). Finally, Kendall’s
tau-c only measures association and does not indicate causality or the strength of
relationships, which could be investigated by further research.
