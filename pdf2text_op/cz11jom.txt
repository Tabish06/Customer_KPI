Facing uncertain environments, ﬁrms have strived to achieve greater supply chain collaboration to lever-
age the resources and knowledge of their suppliers and customers. The objective of the study is to uncover
the nature of supply chain collaboration and explore its impact on ﬁrm performance based on a paradigm
of collaborative advantage. Reliable and valid instruments of these constructs were developed through
rigorous empirical analysis. Data were collected through a Web survey of U.S. manufacturing ﬁrms in
various industries. The statistical methods used include conﬁrmatory factor analysis and structural equa-
tion modeling (i.e., LISREL). The results indicate that supply chain collaboration improves collaborative
advantage and indeed has a bottom-line inﬂuence on ﬁrm performance, and collaborative advantage is
an intermediate variable that enables supply chain partners to achieve synergies and create superior
performance. A further analysis of the moderation effect of ﬁrm size reveals that collaborative advan-
tage completely mediates the relationship between supply chain collaboration and ﬁrm performance for
small ﬁrms while it partially mediates the relationship for medium and large ﬁrms.

1. Introduction

In the past decades, there has been a need for ﬁrms to look
outside their organizations for opportunities to collaborate with
partners to ensure that the supply chain is efﬁcient and responsive
to dynamic market needs. Firms have strived to achieve greater
supply chain collaboration to leverage the resources and knowl-
edge of their suppliers and customers (Fawcett and Magnan, 2004;
Lejeune and Yakova, 2005). Supply chain collaboration means two
or more autonomous ﬁrms working jointly to plan and execute
supply chain operations (Simatupang and Sridharan, 2002). It can
deliver substantial beneﬁts and advantages to its partners (Mentzer
et al., 2000). Firms such as Hewlett–Packard, IBM, Dell, Procter
& Gamble have forged long-term, collaborative relationships with
their suppliers to reduce transaction costs and achieve a stronger
competitive position (Handﬁeld and Bechtel, 2002; Johnson and
Sohi, 2003; Sheu et al., 2006). Collaborative relationships can help
ﬁrms share risks (Kogut, 1988), access complementary resources
(Park et al., 2004), reduce transaction costs and enhance pro-
ductivity (Kalwani and Narayandas, 1995), and enhance proﬁt
performance and competitive advantage over time (Mentzer et al.,
2000).

Despite the popularity and beneﬁts of supply chain collab-
oration, many partner relationships fall short of meeting the
participants’ expectations (Doz and Hamel, 1998; Barringer and
Harrison, 2000). Few ﬁrms have truly capitalized on the potential of
supply chain collaboration (Min et al., 2005; Barratt and Oliveira,
2001). Supply chain collaboration seems to have great potential,
but further investigation is needed to recognize its value (Gofﬁn
et al., 2006).

First, supply chain collaboration (SCC) and supply chain integra-
tion (SCI) sometimes have been used interchangeably since both
refer to a tight coupling process between supply chain partners.
However, the term integration means the uniﬁed control (or own-
ership) of several successive or similar process formerly carried on
independently (Webster, 1966; Flynn et al., 2010). So it puts more
emphasis on central control, ownership, or process integration gov-
erned by contract means. According to transaction cost economics
(TCE) theory, between the two ends of governance continuum
of vertical integration and market exchange, collaboration is an
intermediate form of hybrid governance. Collaboration is attrac-
tive since it puts more emphasis on governance through relational
means in addition to governance through contract means (Nyaga
et al., 2010). Although there are some overlaps between SCC and SCI,
SCC is a better construct to capture the joint relationship between
autonomous supply chain partners.

Knowledge of supply chain collaboration has been obscured by
the vague term of integration (Gofﬁn et al., 2006). In the exiting
SCI literature, most studies do not focus on the conceptualiza-


164

tion of integration, but focus on operationalizing the individual
component of supply chain integration, e.g., customer integra-
tion, supplier integration, and internal integration (Frohlich and
Westbrook, 2001; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Chen and Paulraj,
2004; Petersen et al., 2005; Das et al., 2006; Deveraj et al., 2007;
Zhao et al., 2008; Van der Vaart and Van Donk, 2008). For more
detailed review, see Van der Vaart and Van Donk (2008) and Flynn
et al. (2010). Flynn et al. (2010) point out that many conceptual-
izations of SCI are incomplete, and these incomplete and evolving
conceptualizations have led to inconsistent ﬁndings.

A signiﬁcant amount of research has focused on the devel-
opment of supply chain integration models that advance our
understanding of this relatively new research area (Frohlich and
Westbrook, 2001; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Das et al., 2006;
Deveraj et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2008; Chen and Paulraj, 2004;
Van der Vaart and Van Donk, 2008; Flynn et al., 2010). What is
lacking is a framework for accurately deﬁning the extent of supply
chain collaboration (Lambert et al., 1999). Previous deﬁnitions of
supply chain collaboration put more emphasis on process integra-
tion and less on the components of relational communication and
knowledge creation (Simatupang and Sridharan, 2005). Miscom-
munication, which causes conﬂicts and misunderstanding between
supply chain partners, is recognized as the reason for many collabo-
ration failures (Tuten and Urban, 2001). Communication is the glue
that holds supply chain partners together through balanced, two-
way, multilevel contacts and message services (Mohr and Nevin,
1990; Chen and Paulraj, 2004). Further, collaboration between sup-
ply chain partners is not merely pure transactions, but leverages
information sharing and market knowledge creation for sustain-
able competitive advantage (Malhotra et al., 2005).

Second, in investigating the consequences of supply chain
collaboration, existing literature has ignored the collaborative
advantage achieved through collaboration. Collaborative advan-
tage is a relational view of
interorganizational competitive
advantage (Dyer and Singh, 1998). Collaborative advantage comes
from relational rent, a common beneﬁt that accrues to collabora-
tive partners through combination, exchange, and codevelopment
of idiosyncratic resources (Dyer and Singh, 1998). It is joint com-
petitive advantage and focuses on joint value creation in dyadic
relationship. Supply chain partners work together toward com-
mon goals and achieve more mutual beneﬁts than can be achieved
by acting alone (Mentzer et al., 2001; Stank et al., 2001; Manthou
et al., 2004; Sheu et al., 2006). In contrast, according to the extended
resource bases view, competitive advantage focuses more on value
appropriation by both appropriating relational rent (i.e., common
beneﬁts) and unilaterally accumulating spillover rents that produce
private beneﬁts (Lavie, 2006).

The concept of collaborative advantage has been mentioned in
the literature (Jap, 2001; Dyer and Singh, 1998; Ferratt et al., 1996;
Kanter, 1994; Vangen and Huxham, 2003). However, the opera-
tionalization of this construct has not been adequately addressed
in the extant literature. In addition, when considering performance
implications of supply chain collaboration, a distinction should
be made between collaboration performance (e.g., collaborative
advantage) and the impact of collaborations on ﬁrm performance.
There are many studies that empirically tested the relationship
between SCI and ﬁrm performance (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001;
Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Das et al., 2006; Deveraj et al., 2007;
Van der Vaart and Van Donk, 2008). There are also some studies that
provided empirical evidence of the impact of supply chain man-
agement practices or SCI on competitive advantage (or operational
performance) and ﬁrm performance (Li et al., 2006; Flynn et al.,
2010); however, there is no empirical work on the impact of SCC
on collaborative advantage and ﬁrm performance.

The objective of the study is to uncover the nature and char-
acteristics of supply chain collaboration and explore its impact

on collaborative advantage and ﬁrm performance by answering
the following research questions? What are the key dimensions
of supply chain collaboration? What is the performance implica-
tion of supply chain collaboration? How to measure collaborative
advantage from a perspective of relational rent? Does collaborative
advantage completely mediate the relationship between supply
chain collaboration and ﬁrm performance? Does ﬁrm size moderate
the relationships among supply chain collaboration, collaborative
advantage, and ﬁrm performance?

The study contributes to our knowledge on supply chain col-
laboration by providing theoretical insights and empirical ﬁndings.
By pooling an extensive set of factors, the research extends our
understanding of the attributes of supply chain collaboration
and collaborative advantage. Through a large-scale Web survey
with manufacturers across the US, the research also intends to
develop reliable and valid instruments and to empirically test
the relationships among supply chain collaboration, collabora-
tive advantage, and ﬁrm performance. In addition, the research
also tests the moderation effect of ﬁrm size on the relation-
ships among supply chain collaboration, collaborative advantage,
and ﬁrm performance using multi-group analysis of structural
invariance.

2. Theoretical paradigms

Supply chain collaboration is rooted in a paradigm of collabora-
tive advantage (Kanter, 1994; Dyer, 2000) rather than competitive
advantage (Porter, 1985). According to the collaborative paradigm,
a supply chain is composed of a sequence or network of inter-
dependent relationships fostered through strategic alliances and
collaboration (Chen and Paulraj, 2004). It is a relational view of
joint competitive advantage (Dyer and Singh, 1998). Collabora-
tive advantage comes from relational rents that produce common
beneﬁts for bilateral rent-seeking behaviors while competitive
advantage encourages individual rent-seeking behaviors that max-
imize a ﬁrm’s own beneﬁts (Lavie, 2006). The perspective of
collaborative advantage enables supply chain partners to view
supply chain collaboration as a positive-sum game rather than a
zero-sum game where partners strive to appropriate more rela-
tional rents for their own competitive advantage. The literature on
supply chain collaboration represents multiple perspectives. This
study examines supply chain collaboration from four perspectives:
(1) transaction cost economics, (2) resource based view, (3) rela-
tional view, and (4) extended resource based view.

2.1. Transaction cost economics

Transaction cost economics (TCE) is a very inﬂuential theory
that can explain relationships among ﬁrms (Williamson, 1975;
Barringer and Harrison, 2000). Williamson (1975) identiﬁes hier-
archies and markets as two methods to organize. According to TCE,
the decision to use either vertical integration/hierarchies or mar-
ket mechanisms depends on the relative monitoring costs that arise
from bounded rationality and from uncertainties due to partners’
self-interest and opportunism (Kaufman et al., 2000).

Supply chain collaboration emerges as the third alternative
to organizing, which helps avoid the problems arising from both
hierarchies and markets (Koh and Venkatraman, 1991). Supply
chain collaboration helps ﬁrms reduce the costs of opportunism
and monitoring that are inherent in market transactions through
process integration and mutual trust, thus increasing the proba-
bility that partners behave in the best interest of the partnership
(Croom, 2001). Supply chain collaboration also helps ﬁrms avoid
internalizing an activity that may not be aligned with their
competencies.

2.2. Resource based view

Resource based view (RBV) of the ﬁrm also receives much atten-
tion in explaining supply chain collaboration. The key concepts of
RBV are resources, capabilities, and strategic assets (Barney, 1991).
RBV argues that variance in ﬁrm performance can be explained by
strategic resources, such as core competence (Prahalad and Hamel,
1990), dynamic capability (Teece et al., 1997), and absorptive
capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Firms that combine resources
in a unique way may achieve an advantage over competing ﬁrms
who are unable to do so (Dyer and Singh, 1998). By owning scarce
resources and assets and excelling in core competencies and capa-
bilities, ﬁrms can reach a sustained market advantage (Knudsen,
2003). RBV claims that investing in relation-speciﬁc assets enables
partnering ﬁrms to build competitive advantage because of their
rare, valuable, non-substitutable, and difﬁcult-to-imitate nature
(Barney, 1991).

The embeddedness of the supply chain partnering ﬁrms’ rela-
tional assets and the causal ambiguity makes it difﬁcult for their
competitors to imitate (Jap, 2001). Supply chain collaboration also
allows ﬁrms to focus on their unique core activities, which increase
ﬁrm speciﬁc skills and realize economies of scale and learning
effects, thereby improving their competitive positions (Park et al.,
2004).

2.3. Relational view

The relational view (RV) complements the RBV by arguing that
critical resources may span ﬁrm boundaries (Dyer and Singh, 1998).
Firms can earn not only internal rents (i.e., Ricardian rents from
scarcity of resources and quasi-rents from added value) but also
relational rents. A relational rent is deﬁned as a supernormal proﬁt
jointly generated in an exchange relationship that cannot be cre-
ated by either ﬁrm in isolation and can only be created through
the joint contributions of the collaborative partners (Dyer and
Singh, 1998; Lavie, 2006). Relational rents are possible when col-
laborative partners combine and exchange idiosyncratic assets,
knowledge, and capabilities through relation-speciﬁc investments,
inter-ﬁrm knowledge-sharing routines, complementary resource
endowments, and effective governance mechanisms.

Collaborative advantage is based on the relational view, which
elaborates on the mechanisms of joint value creation (i.e., inter-ﬁrm
rent generation). It argues relational rents accrue at the collabora-
tion level for mutual beneﬁts. Unlike studies that acknowledge the
role of both private and common beneﬁts (Hamel, 1991; Khanna

et al., 1998), the relational view emphasizes common beneﬁts that
collaborative partners cannot generate independently.

2.4. Extended resource-based view

Conventional RBV assumes ﬁrms must own or fully control
the resources to create value. In the extended resource-based
view (ERBV), resource accessibility, the right to employ resources
or enjoy their associated beneﬁts, enables ﬁrms to achieve
advantages. Lavie (2006) extends the RBV by explaining how inter-
connected ﬁrms in dyadic collaboration/alliance combine external
resources and internal resource endowments to achieve com-
petitive advantage for the focal ﬁrm. According to Lavie (2006),
the competitive advantage of a focal ﬁrm participating in an
alliance/collaboration includes four elements: (1) internal rent, (2)
appropriated relational rent, (3) inbound spillover rent, and (4)
outbound spillover rent. Internal rent can be extracted from the
focal ﬁrm’s own shared and nonshared resources. Appropriated
relational rent can be extracted only from the shared resources of
both partners. Inbound spillover rent is the rent generated from
the partner’s shared and nonshared resources through knowledge
leakage, inter-ﬁrm learning, relative absorptive capacity, and inter-
nalization of the partner’s practices, whereas outbound spillover
rent results from the transfer of beneﬁts from the focal ﬁrm to the
partner. The combination of internal rent, inbound spillover rent,
and outbound spillover rent forms private beneﬁts for the focal
ﬁrm. Its competitive advantage depends on its private beneﬁts and
appropriated relational rent (i.e., appropriated common beneﬁts).
In contrast, collaborative advantage is joint competitive advan-
tage and come from a relational rent, a common beneﬁt that accrues
to collaborative partners (Dyer and Singh, 1998). This type of rent
cannot be generated individually by either collaborative partner. In
addition, Lavie’s (2006) model extends prior research on joint value
creation in dyadic alliance by considering unilateral accumulation
of spillover rents that produce private beneﬁts.

3. Conceptual development

By collaborating, supply chain partners can work as if they were
a part of a single enterprise (Lambert and Christopher, 2000). They
can access and leverage each other’s resources and enjoy their
associated beneﬁts. Such collaboration can increase collaborative
advantage and enhance ﬁrm performance. The relationships might
also be moderated by ﬁrm size. These direct, mediating, and mod-
erating effects are captured in a framework as shown in Fig. 1.

3.1. Supply chain collaboration

Supply chain collaboration has been deﬁned in many different
ways, and basically they fall into two groups of conceptualization:
process focus and relationship focus. Supply chain collaboration
has been viewed as a business process whereby two or more supply
chain partners work together toward common goals (Mentzer et al.,
2001; Stank et al., 2001; Manthou et al., 2004; Sheu et al., 2006),
while SCC has also been deﬁned as the formation of close, long-
term partnerships where supply chain members work together
and share information, resources, and risk to accomplish mutual
objectives (Bowersox et al., 2003; Golicic et al., 2003). The litera-
ture review reveals the importance of planning activities (Boddy
et al., 2000), integrating cross-functional processes (Lambert et al.,
1999), coordinating the supply chain (Kim and Umanath, 2005), set-
ting supply chain goals (Peck and Juttner, 2000), and establishing
information sharing parameters (Lamming, 1996).

Combining both process and relationship focus, SCC is deﬁned
as a partnership process where two or more autonomous ﬁrms
work closely to plan and execute supply chain operations toward
common goals and mutual beneﬁts. SCC consists of information
sharing (Manthou et al., 2004), goal congruence (Angeles and Nath,
2001), decision synchronization (Stank et al., 2001), resource shar-
ing (Sheu et al., 2006), and incentive alignment (Simatupang and
Sridharan, 2005) among independent supply chain partners.

While researchers have addressed some aspects of supply chain
collaboration, they have not adequately highlighted the need
for collaborative communication as a critical variable (Mohr and
Nevin, 1990). Another overlooked but crucial variable in sup-
ply chain collaboration is joint knowledge creation (Johnson and
Sohi, 2003). Synthesizing the literature, this study deﬁnes sup-
ply chain collaboration as seven interconnecting components:
information sharing, goal congruence, decision synchronization,
incentive alignment, resources sharing, collaborative communica-
tion, and joint knowledge creation. These seven dimensions are
expected to be intercorrelated and covary with each other although
there might be causal relationships among them. They add value
to supply chain collaboration by reducing costs and response time,
leveraging resources, and improving innovation.

Information sharing refers to the extent to which a ﬁrm shares
a variety of relevant, accurate, complete, and conﬁdential informa-
tion in a timely manner with its supply chain partners (Angeles
and Nath, 2001; Cagliano et al., 2003; Sheu et al., 2006). Informa-
tion sharing is described as the “heart” (Lamming, 1996), “lifeblood”
(Stuart and McCutcheon, 1996), “nerve center” (Chopra and Meindl,
2001), “essential ingredient” (Min et al., 2005), “key requirement”
(Sheu et al., 2006), and “foundation” (Lee and Whang, 2001) of
supply chain collaboration. The Global Logistics Research Team at
Michigan State University (1995) deﬁnes information sharing as
the willingness to make strategic and tactical data such as inven-
tory levels, forecasts, sales promotion, strategies, and marketing
strategies available to ﬁrms forming supply chain nodes.

Goal congruence between supply chain partners is the extent to
which supply chain partners perceive their own objectives are sat-
isﬁed by accomplishing the supply chain objectives. It is the degree
of goal agreement among supply chain partners (Angeles and Nath,
2001). In the case of true goal congruence, supply chain partners
either feel that their objectives fully coincide with those of the sup-
ply chain, or, in case of disparity, believe that their goals can be
achieved as a direct result of working toward the objectives of the
supply chain (Lejeune and Yakova, 2005).

Decision synchronization refers to the process by which supply
chain partners orchestrate decisions in supply chain planning and
operations that optimize the supply chain beneﬁts (Simatupang
and Sridharan, 2002). Planning decisions are required to determine
the most efﬁcient and effective way to use the ﬁrm’s resources

to achieve a speciﬁc set of objectives. There are seven key sup-
ply chain management planning decision categories: operations
strategy planning, demand management, production planning and
scheduling, procurement, promise delivery, balancing change, and
distribution management (Lockamy and McCormack, 2004). Joint
planning is used to align collaborative partner and to make operat-
ing decisions including inventory replenishment, order placement,
and order delivery.

Incentive Alignment refers to the process of sharing costs,
risks, and beneﬁts among supply chain partners (Simatupang and
Sridharan, 2005). It includes determining costs, risks, and bene-
ﬁts as well as formulating incentive schemes. Successful supply
chain partnerships require that each participant share gains and
losses equitably and the outcomes of the collaboration are quan-
tiﬁably beneﬁcial to all (Manthou et al., 2004). Incentive alignment
requires a careful deﬁnition of mechanisms that share gains equi-
tably, which means gains are commensurate with investment and
risk (Lee and Whang, 2001).

Resource sharing refers to the process of leveraging capabilities
and assets and investing in capabilities and assets with supply chain
partners. Resources include physical resources, such as manufac-
turing equipment, facility, and technology (Harland et al., 2004).
The large body of literature on industry clusters and regional net-
works is one example of the importance of this phenomenon
(e.g. Dyer, 1996). In the retailing sector, practices such as vendor-
managed inventory (VMI) enable suppliers to assess stock-level
data, via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and take the necessary
replenishment action (Lamming, 1996).

Collaborative communication is the contact and message trans-
mission process among supply chain partners in terms of frequency,
direction, mode, and inﬂuence strategy. Open, frequent, balanced,
two-way, multilevel communication is generally an indication
of close interorganizational relationships (Gofﬁn et al., 2006;
Tuten and Urban, 2001). In-depth work by Mohr and Nevin
(1990) explores the pattern of communication from the mecha-
nistic perspective of communication theory. They coin the term
“collaborative communication strategy,” which refers to key com-
munication attributes including frequency, extent of bi-directional
ﬂows, informal modes, and indirect content.

Joint knowledge creation refers to the extent to which supply
chain partners develop a better understanding of and response
to the market and competitive environment by working together
(Malhotra et al., 2005). There are two kinds of knowledge cre-
ation activities: knowledge exploration (i.e., search and acquire
new and relevant knowledge) and knowledge exploitation (i.e.,
assimilate and apply relevant knowledge) (Bhatt and Grover, 2005).
The capture, exchange, and assimilation of knowledge (e.g., process,
technology, or market knowledge) between supply chain partners
enable innovation and the long-term competitiveness of the supply
chain as a whole (Harland et al., 2004).

3.2. Collaborative advantage

Collaborative advantage is also called joint competitive advan-
tage (Jap, 2001).
It refers to strategic beneﬁts gained over
competitors in the marketplace through supply chain partnering.
Collaborative advantage relates to the desired synergistic outcome
of collaborative activity that could not have been achieved by
any ﬁrm acting alone (Vangen and Huxham, 2003). Jap (1999)
explains that collaboration can enlarge the size of the joint ben-
eﬁts and give each member a share of greater gain that could
not be generated by each member on its own. The value cre-
ation from collaboration could be cost savings through the transfer
of best practices, enhanced capacity and ﬂexibility for collective
actions, better decision making and increased revenue through
resource synergy, and innovation through the combination and

167

cross-pollination of ideas. Beneﬁts by business synergy may not
be immediately visible; however potential long-term rewards are
enticing and strategic (Min et al., 2005). Synthesizing the above
studies, this research conceptualizes collaborative advantage as the
following ﬁve sub-components: process efﬁciency, offering ﬂexibil-
ity, business synergy, quality, and innovation. These collaborative
advantage and performance are viewed from the focal ﬁrm’s per-
spective (Duffy and Fearne, 2004).

Process efﬁciency refers to the extent to which a ﬁrm’s collab-
oration process with supply chain partners is cost competitive
among primary competitors (Bagchi and Skjoett-Larsen, 2005). The
process could be information sharing process, joint logistics pro-
cess, joint product development process, or joint decision making
process. Process efﬁciency is a measure of success and a deter-
minant factor of the ability of the ﬁrm to proﬁt (e.g., inventory
turnover and operating cost). Supply chain collaboration facilitates
the cooperation of participating members along the supply chain to
improve performance (Bowersox, 1990). The beneﬁts of collabora-
tion include cost reductions and revenue enhancements (Lee et al.,
1997).

Offering ﬂexibility refers to the extent to which a ﬁrm’s supply
chain linkage supports changes in product or service offerings (e.g.,
features, volume, and speed) in response to environmental changes.
It is also called customer responsiveness in literature (Kiefer and
Novack, 1999; Holweg et al., 2005). Offering ﬂexibility is based on
the ability of collaborating ﬁrms to quickly change process struc-
tures or adapt the information sharing process for modifying the
features of a product or service (Gosain et al., 2004). In today’s
market ﬁrms indeed pay attention to customers and more ﬁrms
solicit customer inputs at the design stage resulting in better accep-
tance of the products and services later (Bagchi and Skjoett-Larsen,
2005).

Business synergy refers to the extent to which supply chain part-
ners combine complementary and related resources to achieve
supernormal beneﬁts. Ansoff (1988) suggests that synergy can pro-
duce a combined return on resources that is greater than the sum
of individual parts (2 + 2 = 5). This joint effect results from the pro-
cess of making better use of resources in the supply chain, including
physical assets such as manufacturing facilities and invisible assets
such as customer knowledge, technological expertise, and organi-
zational culture (Itami and Roehl, 1987). Tanriverdi (2006) offers
two major sources of synergy: super-additive value by comple-
mentary resources and sub-additive cost (or economies of scope)
by related resources.

Quality refers to the extent to which a ﬁrm with supply chain
partners offers quality product that creates higher value for cus-
tomers (Gray and Harvey, 1992; Li et al., 2006). It is expected
that ﬁrms that can respond fast to customer needs with high
quality product and innovative design, and excellent after-sales
service allegedly build customer loyalty, increase market share
and ultimately gain high proﬁts. Garvin (1988) proposes eight
dimensions of quality: performance, features, reliability, confor-
mance, durability, serviceability, aesthetics, and perceived quality,
which are comprehensive but measures for each are difﬁcult to
establish.

Innovation refers to the extent to which a ﬁrm works jointly with
its supply chain partners in introducing new processes, products, or
services. Due to shorter product life cycles, ﬁrms need to innovate
frequently and in small increments (Handﬁeld and Pannesi, 1995;
Kessler and Chakrabarti, 1996). By carefully managing their rela-
tionships with suppliers and customers, ﬁrms improve their ability
to engage in process and product innovation (Kaufman et al., 2000).
By tapping joint creativity capacities, joint organizational learning,
knowledge sharing, joint problem solving between supply chain
partners, ﬁrms can improve absorptive capacity and thus introduce
new products and services fast and frequently.

3.3. Firm performance

Firm performance refers to how well a ﬁrm fulﬁlls its ﬁnancial
goals compared with the ﬁrm’s primary competitors (Yamin et al.,
1999; Barua et al., 2004; Li et al., 2006). In this study ﬁrm perfor-
mance is measured by sales growth, proﬁt margin on sales, return
on investment (ROI), and growth in return on investment. These
measures have been widely used in previous researches because
they are primary yardsticks for most stakeholders (Vickery et al.,
1999; Stock et al., 2000; Chang and King, 2005; Chen and Paulraj,
2004; Flynn et al., 2010; Petersen et al., 2005; Narasimhan and
Kim, 2002). Effectiveness of supply chain collaboration should be
reﬂected on such ﬁnancial metrics.

3.4. Hypotheses development

Previous studies suggested that collaboration beneﬁts include
cost reduction, risk sharing, access to ﬁnancial capital, complemen-
tary assets, improved capacity for rapid learning, and knowledge
transfer (Singh and Mitchell, 1996; Park et al., 2004). Simatupang
and Sridharan (2005) introduce a collaboration index to measure
the level of collaborative practices and ﬁnd that the collaboration
index is positively associated with operational performance.

Supply chain collaboration enables the chain members to cre-
ate responsiveness to react to demand changes. Close collaboration
enables the supply chain partners to improve their ability to fulﬁll
customer needs by ﬂexible offerings (Simatupang and Sridharan,
2005). Decision synchronization and incentive alignment signiﬁ-
cantly inﬂuence responsiveness performance (Fisher, 1997).

Supply chain collaboration promotes a ﬁrm’s ability to capitalize
quickly on market opportunities (Uzzi, 1997). For example, joint
problem-solving increases the speed that products are brought to
market by resolving problems faster. Collaboration between supply
chain partners can be sources of new product ideas (Kalwani and
Narayandas, 1995).

Shared resources between supply chain partners could be
related sources, which reduces sub-additive cost, or complemen-
tary resources, which bring super-additive value (Tanriverdi, 2006).
Both sources of business synergy can bring joint competitive advan-
tage (i.e., collaborative advantage). Firms such as Procter & Gamble,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Dell which work closely with their part-
ners have captured the advantage of collaboration (Barratt and
Oliveira, 2001; Callioni and Billington, 2001). Therefore, this study
develops the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1. Supply chain collaboration has a signiﬁcant posi-
tive effect on collaborative advantage.

The necessary condition for supply chain collaboration is that
the supply chain partners are able to expand the total gain due
to synergy (Simatupang and Sridharan, 2005). The supply chain
partners will gain ﬁnancial beneﬁts by increasing responsiveness,
especially for innovative products (Fisher, 1997). The literature
also supports the ability of partnerships to achieve cost savings
and reduce duplication of efforts by the ﬁrms involved (Lambert
et al., 2004). In particular, cooperation among competitors can fos-
ter greater knowledge seeking and result in synergetic rents (Lado
et al., 1997).

In the short term, ﬁrms will see operational improvements (e.g.,
productivity) as the primary beneﬁts. In the long run, ﬁrms expect
the supply chain collaboration to pay off through more competitive
products and quicker product development that will transform into
possible competitive advantage and increased proﬁts (Stuart and
McCutcheon, 1996). Thus this study hypothesizes:

Hypothesis 2. Collaborative advantage has a signiﬁcant positive
effect on ﬁrm performance.

M. Cao, Q. Zhang / Journal of Operations Management 29 (2011) 163–180

Many scholars contend that both customer and supplier ﬁrms
seek collaborative relationships with each other as a way of
improving performance (Duffy and Fearne, 2004; Sheu et al.,
2006). Supplier ﬁrms can obtain high sales and earn great returns
from resources invested in maintaining long-term relationships
with their customers (Kalwani and Narayandas, 1995). Stank
et al. (2001) suggest that both internal and external collaboration
are necessary to ensure performance. Partnerships can improve
proﬁtability, reduce purchasing costs, and increase technical coop-
eration (Ailawadi et al., 1999; Han et al., 1993).

Lee and Whang (2001) report that a study conducted jointly
by Stanford University and Accenture on 100 manufacturers and
100 retailers in the food and consumer products industry reveals
that companies that reported higher than average proﬁts were the
ones who were engaged in higher levels of information sharing. In
general, researchers suggest that the higher the level of interdepen-
dence (i.e., higher level of collaboration) in a relationship the better
ﬁrm performance (Duffy and Fearne, 2004; Mohr and Spekman,
1994). Thus this study hypothesizes:

Hypothesis 3. Supply chain collaboration has a signiﬁcant posi-
tive effect on ﬁrm performance.

Supply chain collaboration can deliver beneﬁts to all partners,
for example, reducing risk and cost and increasing productivity
and proﬁt. However, collaborating with partners can also cause
increased costs of coordination, compromise, and inﬂexibility (Das
et al., 2006). The effect of SCC on collaborative advantage and
ﬁrm performance is a multi-faceted and intricate issue, which
might require a contingency perspective (Sousa and Voss, 2008).
Potentially, there are many other factors that might impact ﬁrm
performance including environmental or contextual variables such
as ﬁrm size (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001; Hendricks and Singhal,
2005; Krause et al., 2007; Deveraj et al., 2007; Danese, 2007;
Småros, 2007; Johnson et al., 2007; Ramaswami et al., 2009;
Yeung, 2008; Heim and Peng, 2008). Firm size can be repre-
sented as the number of employees, e.g., small – less than 250,
medium – between 250 and 500, and large – greater than 500
(Deveraj et al., 2007). Firms with different sizes might have dif-
ferent supply chain collaborative efforts, achieve different levels
of collaborative advantage and beneﬁts, and thus attain different
levels of ﬁrm performance. Thus, this study hypothesizes that ﬁrm
size will moderate the relationships proposed in the framework.
Speciﬁcally,

Hypothesis 4a. Firm size moderates the relationship between SCC
and collaborative advantage.

Hypothesis 4b.
collaborative advantage and ﬁrm performance.

Firm size moderates the relationship between

Hypothesis 4c. Firm size moderates the relationship between SCC
and ﬁrm performance.

4. Instrument development

The development of instruments for supply chain collabora-
tion and collaborative advantage was carried out in three steps:
(1) item generation, (2) structured interview and Q-sort, and (3)
large-scale analysis. First, to ensure the content validity of the con-
structs, an extensive literature review was conducted to deﬁne each
construct and generate the initial items for measuring the con-
structs. Then, a structured interview and Q-sort were conducted
to provide a preliminary assessment of the reliability and validity
of the scales. The third step was a large-scale survey to validate the
instruments.

4.1. Item generation

The objective of item generation is to achieve the content
validity of constructs by reviewing literature and consulting with
academic and industrial experts. The measurement items for a scale
should cover the content domain of a construct (Churchill, 1979;
Segars and Grover, 1998). To generate measurement items for each
construct, prior research was extensively reviewed (see Appendix
A for literature citations) and an initial list of potential items was
compiled. Out of the extensive literature, 42 items were created
for seven components of supply chain collaboration and 20 items
were developed for ﬁve components of collaborative advantage.
A 5-point Likert scale was used to indicate the extent to which
managers agree or disagree with each statement where 1 = strongly
disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree.

4.2. Structured interview and Q-sort

After the measurement items were created, the common pool of
items were reviewed and evaluated by practitioners from four dif-
ferent manufacturing ﬁrms to pre-assess the reliability and validity
of the scales. First, structured interviews were conducted to check
the relevance and clarity of each sub-construct’s deﬁnition and
the wording of question items. Then, interviewees were asked to
sort out the questionnaire items into corresponding sub-constructs.
Based on the feedback from the experts, redundant and ambiguous
items were eliminated or modiﬁed. New items were added when
necessary. Three Q-sort measures were used to evaluate the instru-
ments. Inter-judge raw agreement score is the number of items
that both judges agree to place into a certain category divided by
the total number of items. Second, item placement ratio (i.e., hit
ratio) is items that are correctly sorted into the intended theoret-
ical category divided by twice the total number of items. Third,
Cohen’s Kappa is the proportion of joint judgments where there is
agreement after chance agreement is excluded. The detailed Q-sort
results are available from the authors. After two rounds of Q-sort,
items were distributed to six academicians who reviewed each item
and indicated to keep, drop, modify, or add items to the constructs.
The purpose was to further reﬁne the items. Based on the feed-
back from the reviewers, items were further modiﬁed. Overall, 59
questionnaire items were sent out for a large-scale survey.

4.3. Sampling design and large-scale data collection

Supply chain collaboration and collaborative advantage focus
on the joint relationship between supply chain partners. Therefore,
the theoretical constructs identiﬁed in this study are conceptual-
ized to study the dyadic relationship between manufacturers and
their primary/key suppliers. The unit of analysis is thus the dyadic
relationship, viewed from a focal manufacturer’s perspective.

The sample respondents were expected to have knowledge or
experience in supply chain management. The target respondents
were CEOs, presidents, vice presidents, directors, or managers in
the manufacturing ﬁrms across the U.S. We focused the survey on
a senior manager per company as the key informant. The sample
respondents were expected to cover the following seven SIC codes:
Furniture and Fixtures (SIC 25), Rubber and Plastic Products (SIC
30), Fabricated Metal Products (SIC 34), Industrial Machinery and
Equipment (SIC 35), Electric and Electronic Equipment (SIC 36),
Transportation Equipment (SIC 37), and Instruments and Related
Products (SIC 38).

An email list of 5000 target respondents were purchased from
Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP), a
prestigious association of professionals in the area of supply chain
management, and lead411.com, a professional list company which
is specialized at providing executive level email lists. The sam-

ple of 5000 respondents was randomly generated from their large
databases with the speciﬁed SIC codes and job titles. A Web sur-
vey was conducted to reach as many respondents as possible and
retrieve as much information as possible in short time. Excluding
multiple names from the same organization, undelivered emails,
and returned emails saying that target respondents were no longer
with the company, the actual mailing list contained 3538 names.

Table 2
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis results for supply chain collaboration.

To improve the response rate, three waves of emails were sent
once a week. Out of the 227 responses received (16 incomplete),
211 are usable resulting in a response rate of 6.0%. Character-
istics of the respondents appear in Table 1. A chi-square test is
conducted to check non-response bias (see Table 1). The results
show that there is no signiﬁcant difference between the ﬁrst-wave
and second/third-wave respondents by all three categories (i.e., SIC
code, ﬁrm size, and job title) at the level of 0.1. It exhibits that
received questionnaires from respondents represent an unbiased
sample.

4.4. Common method variance

The data were collected from a single respondent per ﬁrm, so
common method bias may be a problem (Podsakoff et al., 2003).
Analysis of Harmon’s single-factor test of common method bias
(Podsakoff et al., 2003; Harman, 1967) revealed 10 factors with
Eigenvalues above 1, explaining 74.9% total variance. The ﬁrst fac-
tor explained 35.8% of the variance, which is not the majority of
the total variance. As a second test of common method bias, conﬁr-
matory factor analysis was applied to Harman’s single-factor model
(Sanchez and Brock, 1996; Flynn et al., 2010). The model’s ﬁt indices
of (cid:2)2/df = 7.8, NNFI = 0.49, CFI = 0.51, and RMSEA = 0.18 were signif-
icantly worse than those of the measurement model. This suggests
that a single factor is not acceptable, thus the common method bias
is small. To further assess common method bias, a measurement
model having only the traits and one including a method factor in
addition to the traits was tested (Widaman, 1985; Williams et al.,
1989; Podsakoff et al., 2003; Paulraj et al., 2008; Flynn et al., 2010).
The results indicated that the method factor, accounting for 8% of
the total variance, marginally improved the model ﬁt indices (NNFI
by 0.01 and CFI by 0.02). Also, the item loadings for their factors are
still signiﬁcant in spite of the inclusion of a method factor. Based on

these analysis results, it is reasonable to conclude that the common
method bias does not appear a problem.

4.5. Large-scale data analysis methods

Using conﬁrmatory factor analysis with LISREL, steps were
undertaken to check (1) unidimensionality and convergent validity,
(2) reliability, (3) discriminant validity, and (4) second-order con-
struct validity. The assessment was conducted for each construct in
one ﬁrst-order correlated model so related multi-items measures
are grouped together (Papke-Shields et al., 2002). Iterative mod-
iﬁcations were undertaken by dropping items with loadings less
than 0.7 and also items with high correlated errors thus improv-
ing the model ﬁt to acceptable levels (Hair et al., 2006). In all
cases where reﬁnement was indicated, items were deleted if such
action was theoretically sound and the deletions were done one
at each step (Hair et al., 2006). Model modiﬁcations were contin-
ued until all parameter estimates and model ﬁts were judged to be
satisfactory.

Unidimensionality is assessed by the ﬁt indices and conver-
gent validity is assessed by the signiﬁcance of t-values of each
measurement indicator. The overall model ﬁt can be tested using
the comparative ﬁt index (CFI), non-normed ﬁt index (NNFI), root
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and normed chi-
square (i.e., (cid:2)2 per degree of freedom) (Byrne, 1989; Bentler, 1990;
Chau, 1997; Hair et al., 2006). Values of CFI and NNFI between
0.80 and 0.89 represent a reasonable ﬁt (Segars and Grover, 1998)
and scores of 0.90 or higher are evidence of good ﬁt (Byrne, 1989;
Joreskog and Sorbom, 1986; Papke-Shields et al., 2002). Based on
Hair et al. (2006, p. 748), “The question of what is a ‘good’ RMSEA
value is debatable but typically values are below 0.10 for most
acceptable models”. The normed chi-square ((cid:2)2 divided by degrees
of freedom) estimates the relative efﬁciency of competing models.
For this statistic, a value less than 3.0 indicates a reasonable ﬁt and
a value less than 2.0 shows a good ﬁt (Segars and Grover, 1998;
Papke-Shields et al., 2002).

Following Hair et al. (2006), the composite reliability (␳c) and
the average variance extracted (AVE) of multiple indicators of a
construct can be used to assess reliability of a construct. When AVE
is greater than 50% and ␳c is greater than 0.70, it implies that the
variance by the trait is more than that by error components (Hair
et al., 2006).

To check the discriminant validity, a pairwise comparison was
performed by comparing a model with correlation constrained to
one with an unconstrained model. A difference between the (cid:2)2 val-
ues of the two models that is signiﬁcant at p < 0.05 level would
indicate support for the discriminant validity criterion (Joreskog
and Sorbom, 1996).

An important aspect of construct validity is the validation of
second-order constructs. T coefﬁcient was used to test whether a
second-order construct exists accounting for the variations in its
sub-constructs. T coefﬁcient is calculated as the ratio of the chi-
square of the ﬁrst-order model to the chi-square of the second-
order model and a T coefﬁcient of higher than 0.80 indicates the
existence of a second-order construct (Doll et al., 1995).

Finally, a LISREL model is run to test the hypotheses devel-
oped in the framework. First, with the whole data set, a structural
LISREL model was run. Second, to test the moderator effect of
ﬁrm size, a multiple-group analysis of structural invariance across
ﬁrm size was conducted (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1996; Schumacker
and Marcoulides, 1998). A series of nested models were tested. A
non-signiﬁcant (cid:2)2 difference between the two successive nested
models would indicate invariance among the groups examined.
Establishing measurement model invariance is essential before
testing invariance of structural coefﬁcients since a failure to prove
the invariance of the measurement model across the three groups

5. Results

5.1. Large-scale measurement results

The construct of supply chain collaboration was initially rep-
resented by seven dimensions and 35 items (see Appendix A). An
all-factor correlated LISREL measurement model was speciﬁed for
each construct. Following Hair et al. (2006), iterative modiﬁcations
were made by examining modiﬁcation indices, correlated errors,
and loadings to improve key model ﬁt statistics.

After modiﬁcations, SCIS1, SCGC5, SCDS5, SCIA3, SCRS2 were
removed from their corresponding constructs because these items
either had low loadings or high correlated errors, and their
removals did not affect much the coverage of the domain of their
corresponding constructs. No items were removed from collabo-
rative communication and joint knowledge creation. There are 30
items left measuring the seven dimensions of supply chain collabo-
ration. The ﬁnal model ﬁt indices of CFI, NNFI, RMSEA, and normed
(cid:2)2 meet the recommended criteria (see Table 7), demonstrating
good unidimensionality. Shown in Table 2, the item loadings for
each factor are greater than 0.70 and signiﬁcant at p < 0.01 based
on t-values. All dimensions exhibit good convergent validity.

The estimates of AVEs for the seven factors are 0.60, 0.63, 0.55,
0.58, 0.61, 0.64, and 0.67 respectively, greater than the critical value
of 0.50. The composite reliabilities (␳c’s) for the seven factors are
0.86, 0.87, 0.83, 0.84, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.91 respectively, above the
critical value of 0.70. The results of the AVEs and ␳c’s provide evi-
dence of good reliability for each factor.

Table 3 reports the results of the discriminant validity. 21
pairwise (cid:2)2 differences between constrained and unconstrained
models for the seven dimensions of supply chain collaboration are
all signiﬁcant at p < 0.05; 13 out of 21 pairwise comparisons are
signiﬁcant at p < 0.01. The results support the case for discriminant
validity.

The same process was followed for collaborative advantage.
There are 20 items measuring the ﬁve dimensions of collabora-
tive advantage. The ﬁnal model ﬁt indices of CFI, NNFI, RMSEA,
and normed (cid:2)2 for each dimension meet the recommended cri-
teria (see Table 7), demonstrating good unidimensionality. Shown

in Table 4, the item loadings for each factor are greater than 0.70
and signiﬁcant at p < 0.01 based on t-values. All dimensions exhibit
good convergent validity.

The estimates of AVEs for the ﬁve factors are 0.66, 0.77, 0.74,
0.73 and 0.71 respectively, greater than the critical value of 0.50.
The composite reliabilities (␳c’s) for the ﬁve factors are 0.89, 0.93,
0.92, 0.92 and 0.91 respectively, above the critical value of 0.70. The
results of the AVEs and ␳c’s provide evidence of good reliability for
each factor.

Table 5 reports the results of the discriminant validity. Ten
pairwise (cid:2)2 differences between constrained and unconstrained
models for the ﬁve dimensions of collaborative advantage are all
signiﬁcant at p < 0.01. The results support the case for discriminant
validity.

The same process was followed for ﬁrm performance. There are
four items measuring the ﬁrm performance. The ﬁnal model ﬁt
indices and factor loadings (Table 6) meet the recommended crite-
ria. The estimate of AVE of 0.74 and the composite reliability of 0.92
exceed the critical value of 0.50 and 0.70 respectively, providing
evidence of good reliability.

5.2. Validation of second-order constructs

The second-order model explains the co-variations among ﬁrst-
order factors in a more parsimonious way. However, the variations
shared by the ﬁrst-order factors cannot be totally explained by the
single second-order factor, and thus the ﬁt indices of the higher-
order model can never be better than the corresponding ﬁrst-order
model (Segars and Grover, 1998). The ﬁrst-order model provides
a target ﬁt for higher-order models. The efﬁcacy of second-order
models can be assessed by examining the target (T) coefﬁcient
(where T = ﬁrst-order (cid:2)2/second-order (cid:2)2) (Marsh and Hocevar,
1985). The T coefﬁcient 0.80–1.00 indicates the existence of a
second-order construct.

Table 7 shows the calculated target coefﬁcient between the
ﬁrst-order model and the second-order model for each construct
discussed here. The T coefﬁcients for supply chain collaboration
and collaborative advantage are 0.974 and 0.925 respectively,
suggesting that the second-order models should be accepted
as more accurate representation of model structure over the
corresponding ﬁrst-order model because they represent more par-
simonious explanation of observed covariance. The results support

5.3. Hypotheses testing results

To test the Hypotheses 1–3 proposed in the framework, struc-
tural equation modeling (LISREL) was used to assess the model ﬁt
with the data. The summed item scores for each of the seven dimen-
sions are used as indicators to measure supply chain collaboration.
The summed item scores for each of the ﬁve dimensions are used as
indicators to measure collaborative advantage. The four items are
used as indicators for ﬁrm performance. The path diagram and the
loadings for the LISREL model are shown in Fig. 2. In terms of over-
all ﬁt, chi-square statistic is 293.25 with df = 101 and the ratio of
chi-square to degrees of freedom is 2.90, which indicates a good ﬁt.
The model ﬁt indices NNFI = 0.90, CFI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.09 are good.
The result in Fig. 2 supports Hypothesis 1. The LISREL path
coefﬁcient is 0.64 (t = 8.75), which is statistically signiﬁcant at the
level of 0.01. This supports the claim that supply chain collabora-
tion has signiﬁcant, positive, and direct impacts on collaborative
advantage. Hypothesis 2 is conﬁrmed. The LISREL path coefﬁcient
is 0.50 (t = 6.39), which is statistically signiﬁcant at the level of 0.01.
This indicates that collaborative advantage has a signiﬁcant, posi-
tive, and direct impact on ﬁrm performance. Hypothesis 3 is also
supported with the path coefﬁcient of 0.35 (t = 4.75), which is statis-
tically signiﬁcant at the level of 0.01. This corroborates that supply
chain collaboration has signiﬁcant, positive, and direct impact on
ﬁrm performance. It is also important to note that supply chain
collaboration have a positive indirect impact on ﬁrm performance
(path coefﬁcient = 0.32, t = 5.23) along the path of collaborative
advantage. Therefore, the collaborative advantage among supply
chain partners is a huge ampliﬁer that can help partners to achieve
synergies and create superior ﬁrm performance.

While the ﬁrst three hypotheses are supported, it is not clear
whether these hypotheses hold across small, medium and large
ﬁrms. That means, would the relationships remain signiﬁcant or
invariant across the three groups? To test the moderating effect
of ﬁrm size, a multi-group analysis of structural invariance across
ﬁrm sizes was conducted in LISREL (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1996;
Schumacker and Marcoulides, 1998). Firms with less than 250,
between 250 and 500, and greater than 500 employees are respec-
tively classiﬁed as small (n = 64), medium (n = 58), and large (n = 89).
We tested ﬁrst for the baseline model (i.e., equal pattern, Model 1
in Table 8), then for equal factor loadings (i.e., equal lamda, Model 2
in Table 8), for equal factor inter-correlations (i.e., equal phi, Model
3 in Table 8), for equal measurement errors (i.e., equal theta-delta
and theta-epsilon, Model 4 in Table 8), and ﬁnally for equal struc-
tural coefﬁcients (i.e., equal gamma and beta, Model 4a, 4b, and 4c
in Table 8).

The baseline model (Model 1 in Table 8) has normed (cid:2)2,
CFI, NNFI, and RMSEA of 1.75, 0.89, 0.87, and 0.104 respectively.
Although RMSEA scores a little bit above 0.10, considering other
model ﬁt indices using a comprehensive assessment, the model ﬁts
sufﬁciently well with data and thus acceptable. Each factor loading
(lamda) was forced to be equal across the three groups yielding
Model 2 in Table 8. The (cid:2)2 differences between Model 2 and Model
1 is 35.37 with df of 26. This insigniﬁcant result (p = 0.104) shows
that factor loadings appear to be invariant across the three groups.
Similarly, the (cid:2)2 differences between Model 3 and Model 2 is
0 with two degrees of freedom. This insigniﬁcant result (p = 1.000)
shows that factor loadings and factor inter-correlations appear to
be invariant across the three groups. The (cid:2)2 difference between
Model 4 and Model 3 is 21.86 with 14 degrees of freedom. This
insigniﬁcant result (p = 0.082) shows that factor loadings, factor
inter-correlations, and measurement errors appear to be invariant
across the three groups.

level of association between SCC and FP is different across the three
groups.
To further analyze the moderation effect of ﬁrm size, the stan-
dardized structural path coefﬁcients for SCC→ CA, CA→ FP, and
SCC→ FP across small, medium, and large ﬁrms are shown in
Table 9. These path coefﬁcients are also plotted in Fig. 3. For the
relationship of SCC→ CA, the path coefﬁcients are all signiﬁcant for
the three groups. The path coefﬁcients for small ﬁrms (path coef-
ﬁcient = 0.59, t = 4.50) and medium ﬁrms (path coefﬁcient = 0.50,
t = 3.64) are similar while the path coefﬁcient for large ﬁrms (path
coefﬁcient = 0.78, t = 6.79) are much higher. The results support that
large ﬁrms are more effective in jointly creating value with their
partners than small and medium ones. This is also demonstrated
by the successful collaboration stories of large ﬁrms such as Procter
& Gamble, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Dell with their partners.
For the association of CA→ FP, all three path coefﬁcients are
signiﬁcant, but the path coefﬁcient decreases as ﬁrm size increases
(path coefﬁcients are 0.61, 0.52, and 0.43 respectively for small,
medium, and large ﬁrms). The association of CA with FP is stronger
for smaller ﬁrms than for larger ﬁrms because smaller ﬁrms are
more likely to be highly focused and thus their performance
depends on the joint beneﬁts of the supply chain collaboration for
their limited set of products (Hendricks and Singhal, 2005). Thus,
smaller ﬁrms are more effective in improving their performance
by appropriating the relational rents than larger ones. This doesn’t
mean that smaller ﬁrms get more returns in dollars since path
coefﬁcients are completely standardized. Smaller ﬁrms get more

returns relative to their ﬁrm size than larger ﬁrms. This is con-
sistent with the relative ﬁrm size hypothesis (i.e., value creation
expressed as a percentage of ﬁrm size) that smaller ﬁrms get more
abnormal returns from alliances than larger ﬁrms but their gains in
dollar value might be similar (Koh and Venkatraman, 1991; Anand
and Khanna, 2000).
For the relationship of SCC→ FP, the path coefﬁcient for small
ﬁrms are insigniﬁcant (path coefﬁcient = 0.18, t = 1.38) at the level
of 0.05 while the path coefﬁcients for both medium (path coef-
ﬁcient = 0.43, t = 3.69), and large ﬁrms (path coefﬁcient = 0.42,
t = 3.03) are signiﬁcant and similar. This is in line with the extended
resource based view that inter-ﬁrm learning and knowledge are
easier to be transferred and utilized in other related business areas
and thus generate more spillover rents for medium and large ﬁrms
than small ﬁrms. This also echoes the relatedness hypothesis that
larger ﬁrms can enjoy advantages of scale and scope economies,
efﬁciency in resource allocation, and opportunities to use technical
and managerial skills learned from partners in its related businesses
(Koh and Venkatraman, 1991; Ramaswami et al., 2009).

6. Discussion and implications

The research has provided a more accurate and comprehen-
sive deﬁnition of supply chain collaboration with both process
and relationship focuses. The study has identiﬁed a set of seven
interconnecting dimensions that make up effective supply chain
collaboration: information sharing, goal congruence, decision syn-
chronization, incentive alignment, resource sharing, collaborative
communication, and joint knowledge creation. Beneﬁts of supply
chain collaboration will be realized when all parties in the sup-
ply chain from suppliers to customers cooperate. Jointly creating
the common pace of information sharing, replenishment, and sup-
ply synchronization in a supply chain can reduce excess inventory,
avoid costly bullwhip effect, enhance business synergy and quality,
provide offering ﬂexibility, and increase joint innovation.

The study has developed valid and reliable instruments for
supply chain collaboration and collaborative advantage. All the
scales have been tested through rigorous statistical methodologies
including Q-sort method, conﬁrmatory factor analysis, reliability,
and the validation of second-order construct. All the scales are
shown to meet the requirements for reliability and validity and
thus can be used in future research. The accurate deﬁnitions and


M. Cao, Q. Zhang / Journal of Operations Management 29 (2011) 163–180

measures of supply chain collaboration has provided a rich and
structured understanding of what occurs in a supply chain or net-
work. They also facilitate empirical research efforts because the
relationships among constructs can be better captured with better
deﬁnitions and measures.

Along the line of evidence for the relationship between supply
chain integration and ﬁrm performance (Frohlich and Westbrook,
2001; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Das et al., 2006; Deveraj et al.,
2007; Flynn et al., 2010), the study has provided empirical evidence
of the performance implications of collaboration, which is based
on a comprehensive conceptualization of seven interconnecting
dimensions. In this fashion, the study has answered the calls of
researchers who have stressed the need for empirical research that
examines the outcomes of collaboration (Jap, 1999; Wong, 1999),
collaborative advantage and ﬁrm performance in particular. The
research results have highlighted the critical role of supply chain
collaboration and the amplifying role of collaborative advantage in
achieving ﬁrms’ performance.

The results strongly support the claim that supply chain collabo-
ration increases collaborative advantage (H1). Better collaboration
among supply chain partners expand the gain pie due to synergy
through complementary resources and collaborative processes
(Jap, 1999; Tanriverdi, 2006; Simatupang and Sridharan, 2005). The
results empirically conﬁrm that collaborative advantage increases
ﬁrm performance directly (H2) and well executed supply chain
collaboration directly improves ﬁrm performance (H3). Previous
research links collaboration directly to ﬁrm performance (Duffy
and Fearne, 2004; Stank et al., 2001; Tan et al., 1998) without
explicitly considering an intermediate variable such as collabora-
tive advantage. This is an important ﬁnding since there exists doubt
among researchers and practitioners in the economic justiﬁcation
of supply chain collaboration, particularly in whether collabora-
tive advantage can bring ﬁnancial beneﬁts to the focal ﬁrm. The
statistical signiﬁcance of Hypotheses 2 and 3 suggests that sup-
ply chain collaboration and collaborative advantage indeed have a
bottom-line inﬂuence on the ﬁrm performance. The implementa-
tion of supply chain collaboration will improve a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial
performances in the long run.

Based on the ERBV (Lavie, 2006), collaborative advantage can
be understood as a function of the combined value and rarity of
all shared resources among supply chain partners (i.e., relational
rents) while competitive advantage of a ﬁrm depends on the total
value and rarity of the ﬁrm’s own shared and nonshared resources
(i.e., internal rents) and resources interactions with partners (i.e.,
appropriated relational rents and spillover rents). When collabora-
tion is formed, each partner endows a subset of its resources to the
collaboration with the expectation of generating common beneﬁts
from the shared resources of both ﬁrms (Lavie, 2006).
According to the relational view and the ERBV (Dyer and Singh,
1998; Lavie, 2006), the link of SCC→ CA (i.e., H1) focuses on the
joint value creation process. Firms generate common beneﬁts (i.e.,
relational rents) through supply chain collaboration. The link of
CA→ FP (i.e., H2) focuses on the value appropriation process. Firms
improve their performance by appropriating relational rents. The
direct link of SCC→ FP (i.e., H3) focuses on the spillover rents (and
internal rents) that generate private beneﬁts to the focal ﬁrm, which
is not related to collaborative advantage. Such private beneﬁts
directly impact ﬁrms’ performance.

In examining the moderator of ﬁrm size that set bound-
ary conditions for SCC and CA effects, we found interesting
results shown in Table 9. For small ﬁrms, the direct relationship
between SCC and FP is insigniﬁcant (path coefﬁcient = 0.18, t = 1.38).
Both SCC→ CA (path coefﬁcient = 0.59, t = 4.50) and CA→ FP (path
coefﬁcient = 0.61, t = 4.15) are signiﬁcant. The results show that col-
laborative advantage completely mediate the relationship between
SCC and FP for small ﬁrms. For medium ﬁrms, the path coefﬁcients

175
for SCC→ CA, CA→ FP, and SCC→ FP are all signiﬁcant so the collab-
orative advantage partially mediate the relationship between SCC
and FP. Similarly, for large ﬁrms, all three path coefﬁcients are sig-
niﬁcant so that CA also partially mediate the relationship between
SCC and FP.

These results echo the literature acknowledging both common
beneﬁts and private beneﬁts (Hamel, 1991; Khanna et al., 1998;
Lavie, 2006). For small ﬁrms, SCC helps them jointly create value
with their partners but their inter-ﬁrm learning and joint knowl-
edge are difﬁcult to internalize or transfer to other business areas
due to their small scale and scope of operations. Thus, SCC can
cause little spillover effect that generates private beneﬁts. In other
words, SCC can achieve almost no beneﬁts that are not related to
the collaborative advantage, and thus it has no direct impact on
ﬁrm performance. So the impact of SCC on ﬁrm performance is
completely mediated by collaborative advantages for small ﬁrms.
For medium and large ﬁrms, it is easier for them to internalize
and transfer what they have learned from supply chain collab-
oration to other related business areas due to their diversiﬁed
businesses and large scope of operations. These spillover effects
generate private beneﬁts and thus SCC directly impact ﬁrm per-
formance as well as indirectly improve ﬁrm performance through
collaborative advantages by jointly creating value with their part-
ners. This explains the partial mediation effect of collaborative
advantage on the relationship between SCC and FP.

The model development and empirical testing presented in
the study move our understanding of supply chain collaboration
a step forward. They provide important guidance for managers
to achieve better partnership formation, management, and out-
comes. Collaboration is good, but ﬁrms must invest efforts to make
it work. Collaboration fails largely because it is not well executed
(Lambert et al., 1999). In addition, collaboration might also cause
the increased cost of coordination and inﬂexibility (Das et al., 2006)
so that managers need to strike the balance and ﬁnd an optimal
level of collaborative efforts for their ﬁrms.

The deﬁnition and measures of supply chain collaboration and
collaborative advantages can help managers to deﬁne speciﬁc
actions to be taken collaboratively to improve shared supply chain
processes that beneﬁt all members (Wong, 1999; Lambert et al.,
1999). The deﬁnition and measurements can serve as a powerful
tool for managers to form effective collaborative relationships. They
can also help ﬁrms to minimize the chance of collaboration failure
by addressing these key dimensions before entering the collabora-
tive relationship.

The study found that effective supply chain collaboration leads
to collaborative advantage and better ﬁrm performance. The rela-
tionship implies that, in order for a supply chain as a whole to
perform well, ﬁrms should try to create a win–win situation that
all participants collaborate to achieve business synergy and com-
pete with other chains. Normally competitive expectations lead
individual ﬁrms to promote their own interests at the expenses
of others. This is very insidious for collaboration and it will worsen
and destroy the relationships. Long-term relationships such as sup-
ply chain collaboration have to be motivated by the mutuality of
intent, goal congruence, and beneﬁt sharing (Wong, 1999; Tuten
and Urban, 2001). Thus, managers need to align goals and beneﬁts
with supply chain partners for creating collaborative advantage.
Such collaborative advantage indeed directly increases the ﬁnancial
performance for each partner in the chain.

Collaboration between supply chain partners is not merely pure
transactions, but leverages market knowledge creation (Malhotra
et al., 2005). Since great diversity of knowledge is distributed
across the supply chain, collaboration provides an ideal platform for
learning (Verwaal and Hesselmans, 2004) and facilitates partner-
enabled market knowledge creation (Malhotra et al., 2005). Supply
chain collaboration can also be an effective means of transferring


176

knowledge and new technical skills across ﬁrms. It is often difﬁcult
for a ﬁrm to buy a particular skill in the marketplace because of its
tacit nature (Mowery et al., 1996). A ﬁrm may have a better chance
of accomplishing its objective of acquiring new skills and compe-
tencies by collaborating with a ﬁrm that is exemplary in that area
(Barringer and Harrison, 2000).

An analysis of moderator effect of ﬁrm size shows the impor-
tance of inter-ﬁrm learning and knowledge transfer. A ﬁrm’s ability
to internalize and transfer its inter-ﬁrm learning and knowledge
from collaboration depends on its absorptive capacity, which mea-
sures a ﬁrm’s ability to identify, evaluate, assimilate, and exploit
external knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). A ﬁrm’s absorp-
tive capacity enhances its learning from partners and eventually
contributes to ﬁrm performance. Thus, the better the focal ﬁrm’s
absorptive capacity, the higher the spillover rents and the relational
rents appropriated by the focal ﬁrm will be. Thus, managers should
manage to improve their absorptive capacity and thus improve
their ﬁrm performance. Especially for small ﬁrms, they need to ade-
quately expand the scope of their operations to transfer inter-ﬁrm
learning from collaboration.

Firms seek to internalize the resources and skills of their col-
laborative partners to improve their performance. When the ﬁrm
and its partners pursue such objectives, the parties might engage
in learning races or one party exploits the collaboration for its pri-
vate beneﬁts, which lead to an unintended leakage of rents with no
synergistic value creation (Hamel, 1991; Khanna et al., 1998; Lavie,
2006). So managers need to be co-opetitive and balance the collab-
oration and competition. To collaborate well, ﬁrms need to work
closely with partners to jointly create values that generate com-
mon beneﬁts; to be competitive, ﬁrms might also actively invest in
improvement of absorptive capacity and thus earn spillover rents
that generate private beneﬁts.

7. Limitations and future research

While the research has made signiﬁcant contributions to
research and practice, there are limitations that need to be
considered when interpreting the study ﬁndings. Because of
the limited number of observations (211), the revalidation of
constructs was not carried out in this research. This needs
to be addressed in the future research. New data may be
collected to revalidate the measures and structural models.

Constructs

Dimensions/items

Future research should conduct factorial invariance tests. Using
the instruments developed in this research, one may test for fac-
torial invariance across industries (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1996;
Schumacker and Marcoulides, 1998). For example, an analysis of
supply chain collaboration by industry would be very beneﬁcial.
Examining how they are used across different industries and what
are the most common level of supply chain collaboration in each
industry would help identify any industry-speciﬁc bias toward or
against supply chain collaboration.

The respondents include both senior executives (i.e., CEO’s, pres-
idents, and vice presidents) and mid-level managers (i.e., directors
and managers). There might be signiﬁcant differences in rela-
tionship perceptions between senior executives and mid-level
directors and managers. A factorial invariance test can be used to
explore the differences in the future research.

Future research should also apply multiple methods to obtain
data. The use of a single respondent to represent what are supposed
to supply chain wide variables may generate some inaccuracy and
more than the usual amount of random error. Future research
should seek to utilize multiple respondents from each participating
organization as an effort to enhance reliability of research ﬁndings.
More insights will be gained by collecting information from both
sides of the manufacturer–supplier dyad rather than just from one
organization.

In future research, it will be interesting to investigate the
relationships at the sub-dimensional level between supply chain
collaboration, collaborative advantage, and performance. Such
analysis would provide more interesting and useful results for
researchers and practitioners.
