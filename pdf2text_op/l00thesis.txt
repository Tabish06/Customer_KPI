ABSTRACT

Previous research has shown that firms need to understand user needs and incorporate 

them into the design of their new products in order for them to achieve commercial 

success. Other researchers point to the dangers of relying on customers for accurate data 

on new products when these products are based on radically new or ‘disruptive’ 

technologies. This study investigates the impact of end-user involvement in new product 

development activities on product success. Managers at 55 firms developing computer 

telephony integration (CTI) products were surveyed. The findings show that managers’ 

perceptions of end-user involvement in new product development activities increase as a 

function of the level of technological newness of the product. However, increased 

perception of the involvement o f end-users during trials and testing activities has a 

negative effect on product success for these technologically new products. On the other 

hand, for products targeting new markets, increased perception of end-user involvement 

during requirements definition and design specification activities results in greater 

product success. In other words, different dimensions of product newness (market and 

technology) affect the relationship between end-user involvement and product success in 

opposite directions.

1.0  PROBLEM STATEMENT AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 

The ability to successfully develop and market innovative new products is one of the 

most critical success factors for modem firms in a variety of technology-related 

businesses. A significant amount of research has therefore been conducted in order to 

discover the factors affecting the subsequent success, or failure, o f a new product (Brown 

and Eisenhardt, 1995). Most of the research on product development agrees that one of 

the most critical factors leading to successful new product development (NPD) is 

understanding user needs and incorporating them into the new product's design 

(Rothwell, 1974; Cooper, 1979; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1987; Zirger and Maidique, 

1990).

This has led technology driven firms to develop and implement organizational processes 

and infrastructures that facilitate the capture of customer requirement information and its 

integration into the new product's design. However, most o f these processes and 

infrastructures are designed for products that are in the latter stages o f their lifecycle or 

are incremental and continuous innovations (Eliashberg et al, 1997). Wind and Mahajan 

(1997), m their introduction to the special issue on NPD of the Journal o f Marketing 

Research, point to the paucity o f research on the topic of radical or discontinuous 

innovation and suggest several opportunities for research in this area. One refers to 

'knowledge-based marketing research' as the processes for informing users on the 

capabilities of discontinuous new products in order to gather their requirements. They 

propose that further research be focused on these types of methods rather than on those 

that rely on traditional focus group interviews and survey research.

11

Although, the literature provides little guidance to managers involved in discontinuous or 

radical NPD, it appears evident that the development process, including the manner in 

which users are involved, differs markedly from the incremental new product 

development process (O'Connor, 1998). Therefore, the level of innovativeness or 

newness of a product may have a significant impact on its development process and on 

how user requirements are gathered.

A review o f the product development literature leads to a certain degree of confusion 

regarding how and when users should be involved in the NPD process. While many 

authors have proposed that users are an important source of new product ideas (von 

Hippel, 1986), some researchers have argued that being too close to customers or being 

'customer-led' may prove detrimental to innovation and firm performance (Macdonald, 

1995). These and other studies (Christensen, 1997; Ciccantelli and Magidson, 1993;

Neale and Corkindale, 1998) form the basis of an ongoing debate in the literature about 

whether customers and users inhibit or stimulate new product ideas (Slater and Narver, 

1998), and if customer input leads only to incremental new products rather than 

breakthrough innovations.

This project aims to achieve two major objectives. The first one is to fill a gap in the 

literature on product development by providing insight into how product newness afreets 

the manner in which developers solicit and integrate user input during various activities 

of the development process. This study attempts to test the assertions o f previous 

researchers on the benefits and potential dangers o f involving users in the development

12

process, and brings clarity to an ongoing debate in the literature. In addition, most of the 

existing research on the development of radical innovations is case-based and qualitative. 

Therefore, this project attempts to shed some light on previous findings with a larger 

sample quantitative study. The second main objective is to provide managers of new 

product development with guidelines on how and when to involve users in development 

processes according to the level of newness of the product.

The research questions that this project focuses on are:

1)  What effect does the level of newness of a product have on the level o f customer 

involvement in the product development process?

2)  Do radically new product development projects tend to involve product end-users less 

or more than incrementally new product development projects?

3)  What effect does the level of newness of a product have on the level of involvement 

of other customer personnel in the product development process?

4)  Do the types o f market research methods that firms use differ based on the extent of 

the product's newness?

5)  Are projects with a high level of user involvement more successful?

6)  How does product newness moderate the relationship between user involvement and 

success?

Three key variables are measured and analyzed: product newness; user involvement in 

the product development process; and commercial product success. By relating the level

13

of newness and of user involvement to measures o f commercial success, we generate 

managerial guidelines for developers of new products.

The role of users in NPD is dynamic and complex and the challenge for high technology 

firms wanting to sustain competitive advantage lies in learning to rapidly and 

continuously create and dismantle the technological infrastructures required to serve a 

particular market. In other words, knowing when to actively seek out existing customer 

input, when to look toward a different set of users for input and how to shift from one 

value network (Christensen, 1995) to the next while remaining 'close to the customer1 

(Peters and Waterman, 1982), and when to ignore customers altogether and focus on 

technological development.

2.0  LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES

This review draws on research from the product development, marketing and strategic 

management literature. The product development literature emphasizes the processes and 

outcomes of radical new product development, compares them to incremental NPD 

processes and outcomes, and identifies implications for managers of new product 

development. Marketing scholars are more interested in methods of gathering customer 

requirements, while strategy researchers tend to focus on the effects o f radical 

technological change on firm performance and industry structure.

von Hippel (1986) argues that, in fast-paced, high technology industries, traditional 

market research techniques will not provide adequate new product ideas. He provides 

evidence that familiarity with existing product attributes and uses interfere with an 

individual's ability to conceive of novel attributes —a concept referred to as 'functional 

fixedness'. In addition, customers may become so accustomed to current, sub-optimal 

conditions of use, that they will not think to ask for a new solution even if they have real 

needs.

Veryzer's (1998) research into the discontinuous NPD process found that new product 

ideas did not come from customers but rather originated from within the developing firm. 

Although he stresses the value of customer feedback for the development o f really new 

products, he also suggests that customer input may not be relied upon as heavily to guide 

the development process o f discontinuous products, as it is for incremental new products. 

According to O'Connor (1998), in radical innovation projects, customers do not know

15

what their needs are, given that the products require very different behavior patterns or 

open up whole new applications.

Song and Montoya-Weiss (1998) examine the new product development practices o f 163 

really new products and 169 incremental new products. They compare the critical 

activities found to be determinants of new product success: strategic planning, market 

analysis, technical development and product commercialization. While strategic planning 

is the second most important determinant of success for really new products, it has a 

negative effect on incremental new product success. Similarly, business and market 

opportunity analysis is the most important factor for incremental new product success, 

but it has a negative impact on really new product success.

Their results reveal striking differences in the relative importance of activities for really 

new versus incremental new products. Given that user needs are often ill-defined and the 

competitive environment not clearly delineated, detailed market studies will be extremely 

costly to undertake and will not provide valuable data under the breakthrough innovation 

scenario. On the other hand, incremental new products usually involve an existing market 

and proven technology, and therefore, business and market opportunity analyses will be 

critical to understanding market trends, user requirements and competitor capabilities.

The importance of these different activities imply varying degrees of user involvement in 

the new product development process for radical and incremental new products and lead 

to the formulation o f the hypothesis that:

16

Reproduced with  permission  of the copyright owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited without permission.


Hypothesis 1: 

The importance of the input provided by end-users in the product

development process is a function of product newness.

We use the term end-users to designate those individuals at customer firms that use a 

given product on a day-to-day basis as part of their job descriptions. We included this 

specification because, in interviews with managers, a caveat to the general proposition 

that product newness impacts customer involvement has emerged. It may be that only the 

end-users of a given technology are too steeped in the present and fail to provide 

adequate market research data. Therefore, firms do seek out customer input but from a 

different source. Individuals at customer firms that are not end-users o f the technology, 

but play an active role in either purchasing decisions or technical support, are the ones 

that developing firms rely on for a more accurate assessment of where the technology is 

headed, and what features the new product should include. Therefore, we propose that: 

Hypothesis 2: 

The importance of the input provided by other individuals (IT or

technical support personnel, key decision-makers, buyers...) in the 

product development process is a function o f product newness.

Additional evidence suggests that traditional market research methods are clearly not 

appropriate when gathering customer requirements for radically new products.

Effectively describing radical product concepts can be particularly difficult when no 

comparisons can be made with current products. For products that are part of complex 

technological systems, it can be problematic for users to envision features of a product 

that will interact with other not-yet-developed technologies.

In their in-depth case analyses of four, well-known discontinuous innovations, Lynn et al. 

(1996) found that, not only was the information generated from conventional market 

research techniques not useful to radical innovation projects, it was often misleading. 

They propose that a 'probe and leam' process is more suited to highly uncertain, radically 

innovative environments. Companies developed their products "by probing potential 

markets with early versions of the products, learning from the probes, and probing 

again.” This iterative process is inherently exploratory and experimental rather than 

analytical and the authors point to the need to develop entirely different product 

development processes for discontinuous products.

Veryzer (1998) suggests that, in the early phases, breakthrough innovation projects tend 

to use qualitative research techniques that allow them to explore and gain a deeper 

understanding of the likely users and the features of the product they will demand, rather 

than more formal, quantitative techniques such as focus groups and market studies used 

in somewhat less discontinuous projects. In a similar study, O'Connor (1998) concluded 

that the nature, timing and mechanisms used for market learning in radical innovation 

projects differed from those used in incremental NPD. She observes interesting 

differences in the types o f market-related questions asked, and in the market learning 

mechanisms used in breakthrough innovation projects compared to incremental 

innovation projects.

Information acceleration (Hauser, Urban and Weinberg, 1993) and a slew o f other virtual 

reality-based methods are being developed specifically for gathering customer data in

18

radically innovative environments. These techniques place users in the information-base 

of a future world and attempt to create a simulated environment, through multimedia or 

hypermedia technology, for presenting new product concepts to potential users and 

eliciting their reactions.

In addition, sampling can be a serious obstacle to effective market research in radically 

innovative environments. Who to sample and how to ensure that they will be 

representative of the rest of the market? Therefore, in designing user involvement 

structures, firms must be careful not to base their product strictly on the requirements of 

early adopters, whose needs are not the same as those o f other segments in the 

marketplace. Moore refers to this phenomenon as a 'chasm' in the innovation diffusion 

process (1991,1995).

These arguments lead to the hypothesis that:

Hypothesis 3: 

The types of market research methods used during the product

development process are function o f product newness.

Researchers exploring broader issues of corporate and technology strategy have 

examined the reasons why successful firms consistently fail when faced with certain 

types of technological change. Christensen et aL's (1995, 1996) study of the disk drive 

industry shows that established, incumbent firms failed precisely because they were 

attentive to the needs of the customers in their Value network', and failed to recognize 

that certain 'disruptive' technologies would eventually allow newer entrants to take over

19

their market. He emphasizes the influence of existing customers on the technological 

strategies chosen by firms. Because their existing customers demanded incremental 

improvements in the current generation of disk drives, established firms lagged new 

entrants in the introduction of the new generation of disk drives. It can thus be inferred 

that successful breakthrough products that create new markets and are not valued by a 

firm's current customers, are characterized by minimal end-user involvement in the 

development process.

Organizational routines (Nelson and Winter, 1982) and path dependencies prevent firms 

from venturing away from current markets and into unknown territories. The core 

competencies (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990) that enable a firm to serve and even dominate 

a particular market may become core rigidities (Leonard, 1992) following a technological 

discontinuity. The decision to continue satisfying existing and powerful customers may 

be optimal in the short term, considering the revenues to which a firm has grown 

accustomed and needs to sustain its operations. However, the fear of cannibalizing sales 

of existing products and investments in complementary and specialized assets (Teece, 

1988) has led to the decline of many well-established and successful firms.

Chandy and Tellis' research (1998) suggests that a firm's willingness to cannibalize, 

driven by active internal markets, influential product champions, a greater focus on future 

markets, and less specialized investments in a current technology, is an important driver 

o f radical innovation. It appears that the decline o f leading incumbent firms may be the 

result of the very logic o f technological evolution i.e. the forces driving the exploitation

o f existing opportunities structurally impede the development of new ones (Burgelman 

and Sayles, 1986). These forms of organizational inertia can become powerful barriers to 

successful new product development.

Hamel and Prahalad (1994) suggest that "customers are notoriously lacking in foresight". 

Martin (1995) argues that firms should "ignore their customers". These assertions build 

on work by previous researchers who found that a marketing orientation "inhibits 

organizations from developing truly breakthrough innovations" (Kohli and Jaworski, 

1990). On the other hand, Slater and Narver (1998) argue that the traditional marketing 

concept of being 'market-oriented' is still very much desirable and should not be confused 

with being 'customer-led'. There is evidence that being 'customer-led', or responding to 

explicit customer needs, impedes innovation. However, avoiding the "tyranny of current 

markets" (Leonard, 1995) should not come at the expense of a market-orientation, or "a 

long-term commitment to understanding customer needs -both expressed and latent" and 

to developing innovative solutions that produce superior customer value.

This evidence leads us to propose that, in order to develop successful radical or 

breakthrough innovations, firms need to restrain the amount of end-user input that they 

solicit and integrate during the new product development process, for fear of ending up 

with only marginally or incrementally new products. Or more formally, that:

Ia summary, this project tests the following four research hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: 

The importance of the input provided by end-users in the product

development process is a function of product newness.

Hypothesis 2: 

The importance of the input provided by other individuals (IT or

technical support personnel, key decision-maker, buyer...) in the 

product development process is a function of product newness. 

Hypothesis 3: 

The types of market research methods used during the product

development process are a function of product newness. 

Hypothesis 4: 

When product newness is high, high end-user involvement leads to

lower commercial success.

3.0  RESEARCH DESIGN

3.1 Preliminary Interviews

This cross-sectional field study is quantitative in nature. Preliminary interviews were 

conducted with managers responsible for product development at three firms developing 

telecommunications and Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) products. These firms 

included one large multibillion-dollar company, a mid-sized vendor, and a smaller, 

relatively new firm. These initial interviews lasted between one hour and one hour and a 

half. One was conducted face-to-face and the other two over the telephone. These 

interviews allowed the researchers to gain some initial insight into the issues related to 

user involvement in new product development, and further refine the research problem 

and hypotheses.

3.2 Sampling Frame

The telecommunications and CTI industry was chosen as the sampling frame because 

innovation is occurring at a very rapid pace in this field. It can therefore supply an 

adequate number of innovative product development projects to study. In addition, the 

explosion and growth of the Internet has dramatically altered user requirements for 

telecommunications products as well as the competitive landscape of the telecom 

industry. As voice and data communications converge on Internet Protocol (IP) networks, 

traditional telephony vendors must now supply data communications capabilities, 

internet-enabled products and web integration to their customers. Most of these types of 

products, having been developed within the past two to three years, are first generation 

products, that incorporate new-to-the-world technology. The relative newness of the

24

internet, the speed at which it is growing, and the pace o f technological evolution make 

the CTI industry fertile ground for the study of radical innovation.

The study's population consists o f537 computer telephony equipment manufacturers and 

software developers. The list was compiled from the CTI Magazine directory o f firms for 

1998-1999. A sample of 128 firms was randomly selected from the directory. Each firm 

in the population was assigned a number, random numbers were generated and the 

corresponding firm was selected.

3.3 Instrument

The unit of analysis is a computer telephony new product development project The 

questionnaire (see appendix A) was pre-tested during face-to-face sessions with senior 

product development managers at three different telecom firms. Only one of these 

managers had previously participated in the preliminary interviews. Managers involved 

in the pre-test were asked how they interpreted specific questions, if they understood the 

meaning of different concepts, and if the questions were clear and unambiguous. The 

questions, scales and format were revised and changed following each individual session.

3.4 Data Collection

Senior managers responsible for new product development at the 128 firms were 

contacted by telephone and asked to participate in the study. If the researcher was unable 

to speak to the right contact person, a questionnaire was sent by fax or e-mail with a 

cover letter explaining the research project. 30 firms were disqualified either because

25

they refused to participate in the study or because they are subsidiaries o f foreign 

companies and product development projects are managed in their home countries. The 

most common reasons for refusal were time constraints and reluctance to reveal what is 

perceived as proprietary information.

3.5 Response Rate

Managers agreeing to participate in the study were sent the questionnaire by fax or e-mail 

and a time was agreed upon when the researcher would call them back to conduct the 

survey over the telephone. In all, 98 questionnaires were sent. 23 respondents returned 

the questionnaires by fax or e-mail and another 32 surveys were conducted over the 

telephone for a total of 55 usable questionnaires. Therefore, the response rate was 55/128 

or 43 percent. Given that our sample includes a very broad cross-section of firms in terms 

of size and product category as well as a wide range of different products based on cost 

and length of development, we can argue that the results are representative o f the 

computer telephony industry in 1999.

3.6 Variables and Measurement

3.6.1  Product Newness

Two essential dimensions of product discontinuity or innovativeness have been identified 

in the literature: technology newness and market newness (McDermott, 1998). Therefore, 

product newness was measured with five questions relating to technological and market 

issues. Respondents answered the questions on a seven-point unipolar scale with Not 

New at all and Very New as the anchors and Moderately New as the midway-point. The

26

average o f these Eve questions was used to form an overall product newness variable (a 

= .75). The average of the first two questions in question 5 constitutes the market 

newness construct (a = .52):

-  How new (to your company) were the customers targeted by the new product?

-  How new (to your company) were the user needs addressed by the new product?

The average of last three questions constitutes the technological newness construct (a = 

.82):

-  How new (to your company) was the technology embodied in the new product?

-  How new (to your company) was the product architecture?

-  How new (to your company) were the core components or software modules in the 

new product?

3.6.2  Customer Involvement

The product development process is broken down into five major activities: idea 

generation and screening, requirements definition and design specification, technical 

development, trials and testing, and product launch. Respondents’ perceptions of the 

importance o f the involvement of potential end-users of the product during each o f the 

activities of the product development process was measured on a seven-point unipolar 

scale, where Not Important and Very Important are the anchors and Moderately 

Important is the midway-point:

- How important was the input provided by potential end-users o f the product during idea 

generation and screening activities?

27

Similarly, respondents were asked to assess the importance of the involvement of other 

customer personnel during each of the five activities in the development process. These 

other individuals at potential customer firms were described to respondents as IT or 

technical support personnel, key decision-makers, buyers or influencers of the buying 

decision.

3.6.3  Market Research Methods

Respondents also provided data on the various market research methods used during each 

activity of the development process. This was used to measure the extent of the use of 

customer-intensive market research methods (CIMRM) during each of the five 

activities in the product development process. A list of the most common methods of 

market research was provided and participants placed an X in the cell that corresponded 

to the activity during which the method was used. Additional space was provided for 

participants to add any other methods they may have used. Scores were then assigned to 

the different methods based on the extent of customer involvement that they require. The 

following scores were assigned to the different methods:

- 

In-house demos = 0

-  Technological forecasting = 0

-  Customer surveys = 1

-  Focus/Discussion groups = 2

-  User group feedback = 2

-  Alpha/Beta site testing = 3

-  Customer site visits=3

28

-  Direct observation of users = 3

-  Co-development = 4.

Total scores for each activity were then added up in order to derive a measure of the 

extent o f the use of customer-intensive market research methods (CIMRM) during each 

of the five activities in the product development process.

Lead user analysis was left out due to the ambiguity of this concept for the respondents. 

Those who indicated that they used lead user analysis in product development were 

prompted to explain what they meant by lead users. Respondents provided very different 

explanations for what they meant by lead user analysis, von Hippel (1986, 1988) 

describes lead user analysis as a method for seeking out users that face needs well in 

advance of the general marketplace and using these users to generate ideas for new 

products. The majority of respondents think of lead user analysis as a method for testing 

new products with a group of early adopter customers. Therefore, it was decided not to 

include this item in the analysis due to the ambiguity of this concept for respondents and 

the consequent lack of consistency in the responses. Furthermore, very few respondents 

indicated that they used any other methods of market research and so these too were 

omitted from the analysis.

3.6.4 Product Success

Product success was assessed using measures proposed by Griffin and Page (1996) and 

respondents answered on a seven-point bipolar scale, with Well Below Goals and 

Exceeded Expectations as the anchors and On Target as the midway-point:

-  To what extent has the product met revenue goals?

-  To what extent has the product met profit goals?

-  To what extent has the product met quality specifications?

-  To what extent has the product provided a competitive advantage?

3.6.5 Additional Data

Data that may moderate the extent of customer involvement in the product development 

process, such as project duration and budget, were also captured. In addition, the 

questionnaire also included open-ended questions lor participants to provide any 

supplementary information they deemed relevant and that could not be captured using the 

quantitative questions. Finally, respondents were asked to provide general company 

information such as product category and company size (number o f employees, annual 

revenues).

3.7 

Data Analysis 

The quantitative data were analyzed using the following steps:

1)  The raw data were coded and calculations were performed in order to derive 

measures for the variables used in this study.

30

Reproduced with  permission  of the copyright owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited without permission.


2)  Descriptive statistics were computed for all the variables, including frequencies, 

means, standard deviations and Spearman correlations.

3)  In order to test the hypotheses that differences in managers’ perceptions of end-user 

involvement (or other customer personnel involvement) are a function of product 

newness (Hypothesis L and 2), the sample was split into groups reflecting their scores 

on the various newness questions. Three different groupings were used. The sample 

was first divided based on scores for overall product newness, then on the basis of 

market newness, and finally based on technological newness. For each of the 

groupings, a score o f five was used as the cutoff point given the means and that the 

groups would be sufficiently large to conduct the analyses. Products with newness 

scores greater than five were placed in the high newness group, while those with 

newness scores below or equal to five were placed in the low newness group. This 

was performed separately for all three newness dimensions: overall product, market, 

and technological. The means on the end-user and other customer personnel 

involvement measures for the different high and low newness groups were then 

compared using independent samples t-test. Therefore, differences in perceptions of 

user involvement were looked at from three different perspectives on product 

newness (overall, market, and technological).

Although most of the data used in our analyses have normal distributions, some o f the 

variables present slight deviations from normality but no serious skewness or 

kurtosis. Given the distributions, two statistical tests were chosen for the following 

reasons: the two-group t-test is quite robust to deviations from normality; and the

31

Mann-Whitney U test will provide 95% efficiency with normal data. In order to 

corroborate the results from the t-tests, the analyses were also conducted using Mann- 

Whitney U non-parametric tests. The results o f these tests are presented in Appendix 

B and consistently confirm the results obtained with the two group t-tests.

4)  In order to verify the effect of product newness on the types of market research 

methods used during product development (Hypothesis 3), the mean scores for the 

use of CIMRM o f the three different sets of high and low newness groups were 

compared using independent samples t-test (and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric 

test).

5)  In order to test the hypothesis that for really new products, more end-user 

involvement in new product development leads to lower success (Hypothesis 4), the 

high newness groups were also split on the basis of high and low perceptions of end- 

user involvement. Again, given the mean scores on the end-user involvement 

variables, five was also used as a cutoff point to divide the sample into high and low 

end-user involvement groups. The means of the success measures were then 

compared using independent samples t-test (and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric 

test), in order to look for any significant differences between the groups.

6)  Finally, product newness and user involvement (at different activities) were regressed 

(using ordinary least squares estimation) against various success measures to further 

test Hypothesis 4. The different models fitted on the data were all variations on the 

following:

Success = ao + Pi*(product newness) - P2*(customer involvement)

The means for the measures o f perceptions of end-user involvement in new product 

development range from 3.0 for involvement in technical development to 5.14 for 

involvement in trials and testing. Although, average involvement for end-users (4.57) is 

higher than average involvement for other customer personnel (4.07), the evolution of 

involvement across the five activities of the product development process follow similar 

patterns (see figure 3). Involvement starts out high during the idea generation and 

requirements definition activities drops significantly during technical development and 

picks up again during testing and product launch. Means of success measures range from 

4.56 for met revenue goals to 5.67 for provided a competitive advantage. Average 

success ranges from 2.5 to 7 with a mean of 4.98.

Tables 2 through 5 present the correlations between the newness measures and the rest of 

the variables using the foil sample. There are significant positive correlations between 

customer involvement measures - both end-user or other customer personnel - (table 2)

and product newness, mainly during three activities: requirements definition and design 

specification, trials and testing, and product launch. As product newness increases, so 

does the extent o f the involvement of end-users and of other customer personnel in 

requirements definition, in trials and testing and in product launch activities. This initial 

finding leads us to focus our analysis on these activities in the subsequent statistical tests.

Table 3 also shows some significant correlations between newness measures and the use 

of customer-intensive market research methods (CIMRM) during various activities of 

product development. New customers are positively correlated with customer-intensive 

market research methods during technical development, and new user needs are 

positively correlated with CIMRM during requirements definition and technical 

development. New technology is positively correlated with CIMRM during idea 

generation, and new components are positively correlated with CIMRM during trials and 

testing and product launch.

The only success measure significantly correlated with product newness is competitive 

advantage (table 3). New customers, new technology, new product architecture, and new 

components are all positively correlated with the extent to which a product has provided 

the developing firm with a competitive advantage, hi other words, the newer the product, 

the more competitive advantage a firm will benefit from. This result could be a function 

of the innovative environment of the computer telephony industry. The fast pace of 

change and o f technological evolution in CTI rewards innovative firms and therefore, 

managers perceive product newness as a way to achieve competitive advantage.

There are no significant correlations between measures of perception o f customer 

involvement and success measures (table 4). There seems to be no direct relationship 

between managers perceptions' of Luc involvement of end-users or other customer 

personnel in new product development activities and product success. There is however, 

a significantly negative correlation between the use of CIMRM during idea generation, 

requirements definition, and trials and testing activities and the achievement of product 

quality objectives (table 5). This implies that the more firms use the types of market 

research methods that require greater customer involvement, the less the new product 

meets quality specifications.

4.2 

Hypothesis I: Newness and End-User Involvement 

As outlined earlier, the sample was split in three different ways. Between high and low 

overall newness, high and low market newness, and high and low technological newness. 

We will now investigate the effect of these different dimensions o f product newness on 

perceptions of the extent of end-user involvement in new product development activities. 

We therefore look at differences in the means of the end-user involvement measures 

between the high and the low newness groups.

Table 6 presents the results of the independent samples t-tests for mean differences 

between high and low overall newness products (See table 7 in appendix B for results of 

the Mann-Whitney U tests). The only significant difference in the means is for end-user 

involvement in trials and testing activities. For products with a higher degree of overall 

product newness managers tend to have higher perceptions of end-user involvement 

during trials and testing activities only. The same result was observed when the sample 

was split into high and low market newness groups (table 8 and table 9-appendix B). 

When targeting newer markets managers also tend to believe that they involve end-users 

more during trials and testing activities only.

When looking at differences between the high and low technical newness products, 

significant differences in means of perceptions of end-user involvement were observed 

for all but one new product development activity (table 10). Thus, when developing

products with a higher level of technical newness managers perceive that they involve 

end-users more during the requirements definition, technical development, trials and 

testing, and product launch activities. (See table 11 in appendix B for Mann-Whitney U 

tests that confirm these results). These results provide strong support for Hypothesis 1 but 

only under the technological newness scenario. Managers’ perceptions of the importance 

of the input provided by end-users in new product development is a function of the 

technological newness of the product. The newer the technology, the greater the 

perception that end-users are involved in new product development activities.

4.3 

Hypothesis 2: Newness and Involvement o f Other Customer Personnel 

In order to test Hypothesis 2, we repeat the same procedure but now we look at 

differences in the means for the perceptions o f the involvement of other customer 

personnel in new product development activities. When looking at differences between 

the high and low overall product newness groups (table 12 and table 13-appendix B), the 

results are similar to those observed for end-user involvement. The only significant 

difference in the means is for perceptions of the involvement of other customer personnel 

in trials and testing. Therefore, for products with a higher degree of overall newness 

managers tend to have higher perceptions of the involvement of other customer personnel 

during trials and testing activities. Once again, the same result was observed when the 

sample was split into high and low market newness groups (table 14 and table 15- 

appendix B). When targeting newer customers, with newer user needs, managers tend to 

believe that they involve other customer personnel more dining trials and testing 

activities.

However, the similarities between end-users and other customer personnel end here. 

When it comes to differences between high and low technological newness products, no 

significant differences in means of perceptions of other customer personnel involvement 

were observed (table 16 and table 17-appendix B). This clearly contrasts with the prior 

results for measures of end-user involvement, which were significant in all but one new 

product development activity. In other words, when it comes to their perceptions of end- 

user involvement in new product development, managers take care to make distinctions 

between cases o f new or less new technologies. However, new product developers seem 

to perceive that they involve other personnel from customer firms indiscriminately in new 

product development activities, irrespective of the level o f newness o f the product

One factor that may explain this difference is the investment in resources required to 

implement processes for involving end-users in new product development activities. 

Firms are prepared to make these commitments only when they feel that a product is very 

innovative technologically and therefore requires significantly more end-user input. On 

the other hand, involving other personnel such as IT managers, or buyers and decision­

makers can be done without committing a great deal of resources to the task. These 

individuals may become involved and their input gathered on an ad-hoc basis without any 

formal processes being implemented. Therefore, the perception of the importance of their 

input will remain constant regardless of the level of newness of the product. This 

evidence provides weak support for Hypothesis 2, which proposes that the involvement 

o f customer personnel other than end-users is a function of product newness, given that 

this relationship can only be established for involvement during trials and testing.

4.4 

Hypothesis 3: Newness and CIMRM 

With respect to hypothesis 3 and the use of customer-intensive market research methods 

(CIMRM), only one significant difference in means is observed (table 18 and table 19- 

appendix B). Products with a higher level of market newness use more CIMRM only 

during technical development activities. No significant differences in the means of 

CIMRM measures were found when comparing high and low overall product newness 

groups or when comparing high and low technologically new products. Therefore, the 

data does not support Hypothesis 3 given that the use CIMRM seems to increase only 

during the technical development of products addressing new markets.

In summary, our results provide weak support for Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 3 while 

Hypothesis I is confirmed when we take a technological view on product newness. In 

addition, our results indicate that there is no relationship between newness and success

(tables 20,22, and 24 and tables 21,23, and 25-appendix B). The only significant 

difference observed is between high and low technologically new products, where really 

new technologies provide more of a competitive advantage to the developing firm (table 

24 and table 25-appendix B) than incrementally new technologies. However, our results 

may be confounded by the existence of a U-shaped or curvilinear relationship between 

newness and success that our statistical test cannot detect (see figure 4). In their study, 

Kleinschmidt and Cooper (1991) found that both low innovativeness and high 

innovativeness products were more successful than middle-of-the-road, moderately 

innovative products. Therefore, measuring differences in means between high and low 

newness products may fail to provide any significant results.

Hypothesis 4: Really New Products, End-User Involvement and Success 

The final hypothesis proposes that when products are really new, higher levels of end- 

user involvement in new product development leads to lower success. In order to test this 

proposition, we have taken the high newness groups and split them again on the basis of 

end-user involvement. Those with scores above or equal to 5 on different end-user 

involvement measures were placed in the high involvement group and those with scores 

below 5 were placed in the low involvement group. The means of the different success 

measures were then compared.

4.5.1  Overall Product Newness. End-User Involvement and Success 

We begin our analysis by looking at the high overall product newness group. When 

comparing the high and low average perceptions of end-user involvement groups within 

the high overall product newness, no significant differences in success are observed. We 

then compared groups divided on the basis of high and low perceptions of end-user

52

involvement in idea generation, in requirements definition, in technical development, in 

trials and testing, and in product launch. Still no significant differences in success are 

found. We then performed the same analysis for the low overall product newness group, 

and again, no meaningful differences in success between groups of high and low 

perceptions of end-user involvement were observed.

4.5.2  Market Newness. End-User Involvement and Success 

We now look at differences between groups of high and low perceptions of end-user 

involvement for the high market newness products. In this case, an interesting result 

emerges. Our analysis reveals a significant difference in the achievement of profit goals 

between products with managers having high perceptions of end-user involvement during 

requirements definition and specification activities compared to those with lower levels 

of perceptions of end-user involvement during requirements definition (table 26). In other 

words, products targeting newer markets seem to significantly benefit, in terms of 

achieving their profit goals, from increased perceptions of end-user involvement during 

requirements definition activities (See top half of figure 5).

We now test this relationship for products with low market newness to further 

substantiate our finding. For low market newness products, products with managers 

having higher perceptions of end-user involvement during requirements definition 

generated less profits (table 27). Or, when targeting known markets, increased 

perceptions of end-user involvement during requirements definition activities results in 

fewer profits (See bottom half of figure 5).

No significant differences in any other success measure (other than profit goals) were 

observed, and in any other new product development activity (other than requirements 

definition) for either high or low market newness products. (These results are also shown 

to be significant with the Mann-Whitney U tests in tables 28 and table 29-appendix B).

4.5.3  Technological Newness. End-User Involvement and Success 

Let us now examine differences in success between groups with high and low perceptions 

of end-user involvement within the technologically newer products. In this case, it is 

differences in perceptions of end-user involvement during trials and testing activities that 

has the greatest effect on product success. The results show significant differences in the 

achievement of profit goals, of competitive advantage, and of overall success, between 

high and low end-user involvement groups (table 30). However, the direction of this 

relationship is the key finding of our research. For technically newer products, those with 

managers having perceptions of a higher degree of end-user involvement during trials and 

testing activities tend to be less successful (in terms of pro fit goals, competitive 

advantage, and overall) than those with lower perceptions of end-user involvement during 

trials and testing. In other words, involving end-users more during the trials and testing 

activities of really new technologies is detrimental to product success (See top half of 

figure 6).

On the other hand if we look at products in the low technical newness group, those with 

managers having higher perceptions of end-user involvement during trials and testing 

activities score significantly higher on almost all the success measures (revenue goals, 

profit goals, competitive advantage, and overall success) (table 31). Incrementally new 

technologies stand to significantly benefit from increased perceptions of end-user 

involvement during trials and testing activities (See bottom half of figure 6). (Again, 

these results are supported by the Mann-Whitney U tests. See table 32 and table 33 in 

appendix B).

End-user involvement during trials and testing is the only new product development 

activity where high or low perceptions of end-user involvement leads to differences in 

success for really new or incrementally new technologies. However, if we compare 

groups of high and low perceptions of end-user involvement split on the basis of the

average of all the end-user involvement measures, or overall perceptions of end-user 

involvement in new product development activities, we also find differences in success.

Technically newer products score significantly less on product quality when overall 

perceptions of end-user involvement are higher (table 34). On the other hand, when 

technical newness is lower, revenue, competitive advantage, and overall success is higher 

for the products with more overall perceptions of end-user involvement (table 35). So, 

overall perceptions of end-user involvement in new product development activities have 

a positive effect on the success of products with low technological newness (See figure 

7). Therefore, the direction of the relationship between overall perceptions of end-user 

involvement and success provides added support to the findings described above for 

perceptions of end-user involvement in trials and testing. (See table 36 and table 37 in 

appendix B for the results of the Mann-Whitney U test for these cases).

4.5.4  Regression Analysis

Our next step is to fit several ordinary least squares regression models to the data in order 

to further test Hypothesis 4 and the negative relationship between perceptions of end-user 

involvement and success for technically new products. Using only the products with high 

technological newness, we test the following model:

Profit = ao + pi*(technical newness) - P2*(end-user involvement in trials and testing)

Table 38 shows the parameter estimates and their significance. Both predictors are 

significant (p < .05) and the model fits reasonably well (R-Square = .246). The results of 

this regression analysis highlight our study's core finding: the existence of a negative 

relationship between perceptions of end-user involvement in trials and testing and the 

achievement of profit goals, for technically new products. All the major linear regression 

assumptions have been verified. (See Appendix C for details, tables and plots).

We will now test other regression models in order to assess the robustness of this 

relationship (end-user involvement and success). The next model we fit uses the average 

of the measures of perception of end-user involvement during trials and testing and 

product launch (i.e. end-user involvement in the later activities of the product 

development process) as a predictor. Again, we only use the high technical newness 

group:

Profit = oto + Pt*(technical newness) - p2*(average of end-user involvement in trials and 

testing and in product launch)

Table 40 presents the results of the regression analysis and both predictors are significant 

(p< .05). Although the model does not fit the data as well as the previous one (R square = 

.218), it lends further support to our conclusion.

We then test two other models that also provide added robustness to the hypothesis test 

We insert overall perceptions o f end-user involvement (the average of all the end-user 

involvement measures) as a predictor, rather than perceptions of end-user involvement 

only dining trials and testing activities.

Profit = a 0 + pi*(technical newness) - p2*(overall end-user involvement)

Although the technical newness parameter is not significant the sign of the coefficients 

(positive and negative) and the p-values (.063 and .198) illustrate the overall trend in the 

data: for technologically newer products, increases in perceptions of end-user 

involvement result in lower success (table 41).

We then use overall success (the average of all the product success measures) rather than 

profit goals as the dependent variable:

Overall success = ao+Pi*(technical newness) - p2*(end-user involvement in trials and 

testing)

Once again, the technical newness parameter is not statistically significant, but the 

coefficients and p-values also allow us to draw similar conclusions about the existence of 

a negative relationship between managers’ perceptions of end-user involvement and 

success for technologically new products (table 42).

end-user involvement during requirements definition activities is positively associated 

with profit goals for products with high market newness, was statistically significant. 

Similarly, we were unable to build a significant regression model illustrating that, for low 

technical newness, increases in perceptions of end-user involvement during trials and 

testing leads to more profits.

None of these additional models resulted in any findings worth reporting. We also 

inserted various control variables in the regression equations that are believed to have an 

impact on product success or that may moderate the relationship between perceptions of 

end-user involvement and success. Variables such as project size, project length, 

percentage of hardware versus software in the product, company size (number of 

employees, annual revenues) were inserted in the equations and none of them improved 

the fit of the models or were statistically significant.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

5.1  Main Findings

The results of our data analysis point to three key findings. The first one relates to 

Hypothesis 1 and the relationship between product newness and perceptions of end-user 

involvement in new product development activities. When developing products with a 

higher level of technological newness managers tend to believe that they involve end- 

users more in new product development activities than when developing less technically 

new products. Figure 11 provides a graphical illustration of this relationship.

Involvement

Hypothesis 4 proposes that a negative relationship exists between perceptions of end-user 

involvement in new product development activities and success when newness is high. 

Our second main finding relates to this relationship but in the opposite direction. This 

finding reveals that a positive relationship exists between perceptions of end-user 

involvement and success when the product's market is really new. It states that products 

addressing newer markets, and with higher perceptions of end-user involvement during

requirements definition and design specification activities, will achieve their profit goals 

better than products with lower perceptions of end-user involvement during requirements 

definition. Conversely, for products with low levels of market newness, perceptions of 

end-user involvement in requirements definition is detrimental to the achievement of 

profit goals (See figures 12 and 13).

This study's third and most interesting result remains the confirmation o f Hypothesis 4, 

for technologically new products, during a specific product development activity. 

Technologically new products, with increased perceptions of end-user involvement 

during trials and testing activities, do not achieve their profit goals to the same extent as 

the products with lower perceptions of end-user involvement during trials and testing. On 

the other hand, when technological newness is low, the achievement ofprofit goals is 

enhanced by higher perceptions of end-user involvement in trials and testing (See figures

In the following sections, we shall interpret these three results within the context of our 

study’s sample as well as link: them to the existing literature on new product development 

and technological innovation. We conclude with some managerial implications, the 

study’s limitations, and directions for further research in this area.

5.2 

The Impact o f Product Newness on Customer Involvement 

Our study’s first objective was to explore the link between product newness and customer 

involvement in the product development process. Our first main finding indicates that a 

robust relationship between newness and perceptions of end-user involvement can be 

established only when we look at product newness from a technological perspective. The 

more technologically new a product, the more managers perceive end-users to be 

involved in new product development.

However, there is one new product development activity where both end-users and other 

customer personnel are perceived to be more involved as a function of newness: trials and 

testing. In addition, this result is consistent across all dimensions of newness: overall, 

market, and technological. This is probably due to the importance of this activity in 

technology-based industries. For most types of industrial products, where consumer 

market research methods cannot be applied, testing by potential end-users and customers 

is a crucial part o f product development and firms would never dream of launching a new 

product without an adequate number o f trials and sufficient testing. Therefore, managers

71

believe that increased customer involvement in trials and tests will reduce some of the 

uncertainty related to developing really new products. However, this strategy carries 

certain risks and consequences for product success in certain cases that are discussed 

later.

5.5 

Product Success in New Markets 

The second key finding we report is the difference in product success, when market 

newness is high, between products with high and low levels of perceptions of end-user 

involvement dining requirements definition and design specification activities. When 

targeting a new market, increased perceptions of the involvement of end-users in 

requirements definition leads to greater achievement of profit goals. The reverse of this 

relationship was shown to be significant for low market newness products. For products 

addressing known markets, increased perceptions of end-user involvement in 

requirements definition leads to less profits.

When developing products for customers that are relatively unknown to their firm, with 

needs that are also not well known, it becomes critical to involve users in the 

development process in order to gather their requirements and develop a product that will 

respond to their needs. The requirements definition and design specification activities are 

essential steps in the new product development process. It is here that major decisions 

must be made with respect to the product’s architecture and it’s design. Therefore, 

gathering adequate data from a market that is somewhat unknown becomes of utmost 

importance. In addition, when targeting a new set of customers, getting them involved in 

product development can play an important role in product marketing and help stimulate 

sales in this new market.

Requirements definition and design specification also represent activities that require the 

least amount of past experience and relationship with customers. Users participating in 

these types of activities can do so without needing to invest as much or to allocate as 

much resources to it relative to participation in other product development activities. By 

contrast, getting customers involved in technical development or trials and testing 

activities requires a prior relationship with the customers given the investment that 

participation in these types of activities demands (Matthews, 1996). It follows that firms 

are more likely to be successful in involving end-users (and in perceiving their 

involvement as being significantly higher) in requirements definition rather than in other 

activities when they have no prior relationship with them.

On the other hand, when dealing with well-known customers whose needs are also well 

defined, involving them to a great extent in requirements definition may prove 

counterproductive. Having to deal with end-users is a time-consuming process and can 

lead to delays in product development. High-technology markets confer great rewards to 

firms that possess a first-mover advantage. Capturing a larger share of the market early 

on can lead to considerable differences in future revenue and profit streams. Therefore, 

considering how critical time to market can be to profits, a slight delay in the launch of a 

new product can have a significantly adverse effect on profits. In addition, increased 

involvement of end-users can also lead to higher development costs and thus lower 

profits. Hence, managers’ perceptions of lower end-user involvement for known markets.

In their comparison of the product development practices of really new and incremental 

new products, Song and Montoya-Weiss (1998) find that business and market 

opportunity analysis is the most important factor for incremental new product success, 

but it has a negative impact on really new product success. They argue that for 

incremental new products, that usually involve an existing market and proven 

technology, business and market opportunity analyses are critical to understanding 

market trends, user requirements and competitor capabilities. Although our findings do 

not directly contradict their arguments, we propose that the extent to which users are 

involved (and managers perceive them to be) in requirements definition and design 

specification activities is an important moderator of the relationship with success. Market 

studies are important when developing incremental new products but firms must beware 

of spending too much time and resources on gathering user requirements when the

market is well-known and time to market rather than technical excellence is a critical

success factor.

5.4 

Successfully Commercializing Really New Technologies 

When the technology rather than the market is new, perceptions of involvement in trials 

and testing activities becomes a determining factor for reaching profit goals. Greater 

involvement o f end-users in trials and testing of really new technology leads to products 

that are less successful overall. This finding proposes an important caveat to the 

conventional wisdom claiming that firms must understand user needs and incorporate 

them into a new product’s design in order to be successful. The different dimensions of 

newness as well the specific activities where users are involved must be considered in 

order to ensure that success is in fact attained.

Possible explanations for this finding revolve around the quality and the accuracy of 

information generated by end-users who are unfamiliar with a new product’s technology. 

End-users who are accustomed to a current product’s features, capabilities, and usage 

patterns will have great difficulty providing adequate feedback and accurate market data

for a really new product that requires a radical change in thinking and behavior, hi 

addition, gathering user input for technically new products may also lead to delays in the 

development process and thus to lower profits. In fact, conducting trials and tests of 

technology that is still uncertain or unstable can be a very challenging, time-consuming 

and capital-intensive process.

Our finding that perceptions of too much end-user involvement in new product 

development is not beneficial to product success seems to corroborate Christensen’s 

(1997) view that leading firms in the rigid disk drive industry failed because of the 

influence that their existing customers exerted on the firms’ product development 

activities. Existing customers were reluctant to adopt next generation ‘disruptive’ 

technologies because these technologies failed to respond to their needs that were being 

met by current generation ‘sustaining’ technologies. Existing customers asked their 

manufacturers for incremental improvements in current technologies rather than radically 

new technologies. Therefore, leading firms consistently lagged newer entrants when next 

generation technologies replaced the old ones. Not only are users ‘blind’ to the 

capabilities of new technologies that they are unfamiliar with, but they are 

understandably reluctant to adopt new technologies that require that they replace whole 

systems and infrastructures. Users who test really new products have no interest in seeing 

their current investment in a given technology rendered obsolete. Therefore, their 

feedback on trials and tests may not provide an accurate assessment of the market’s true 

needs, and may come to reflect their status-quo bias, path dependencies, and aversion to 

radical change. In other words, excessive end-user involvement in trials and tests may

76

lead firms to develop products that are technologically new but end up as marketplace 

failures given that they incorporate the influence of end-users that have a vested interest 

in maintaining the current product architecture.

On the other hand, products with only marginally new technology benefit unconditionally 

from increased perceptions of end-user involvement in trials and testing. Again, this 

reinforces the argument that end-users are a valuable and useful source of feedback on 

products that they are familiar with, that provide improvements to the current 

technological regime, and that do not require radical changes in usage patterns or 

mandate wholesale shifts to new architectures.

5.5 

Managerial Implications 

Our findings lead to several implications for managers of high technology new product 

development The two key insights that emerge are: managers need to pay close attention 

to the various newness attributes of the products they are developing; and they must also 

become preoccupied with changing levels of end-user involvement during the different 

activities of the new product development process.

In our sample of computer telephony products, technological newness was a determining 

factor affecting the extent of the perceptions of the involvement o f end-users during trials 

and testing activities. However, products with high perceptions o f end-user involvement 

during trials and testing also turned out to be less successful than their counterparts with 

lower perceptions of end-user involvement Managers must be careful not to involve end- 

users indiscriminately in the product development activities o f really new products.

77

Product newness is a multidimensional construct and therefore, managers must involve 

end-users very carefully according to the product’s specific newness attributes (market or 

technological). Similarly, user involvement must evolve dynamically across all the 

different product development activities rather than remain static from idea generation to 

launch.

When developing incremental new technologies, firms should increase the extent to 

which end-users are involved in trials and testing. Conversely, firms should restrain end- 

user involvement during trials and testing when the product is based on a radically new 

technology. Therefore, end-user involvement in trials and testing activities needs to be 

moderated by the product’s level of technical newness.

For products addressing new customers and new needs, the inverse relationship applies. 

The newer the market, the more end-users need to be involved in requirements definition 

and design specification. On the other hand, when a firm knows the customers and their 

needs, the product will be more profitable if the firm does not involve end-users in 

requirements definition as much. There appears to be a real danger in involving end-users 

systematically and consistently in all new product development activities and irrespective 

of the product’s particular newness attributes.

S.6 

Limitations o f the Study 

This study uses a single industry at a single point in time as the sampling frame. 

Therefore, there will be severe limits to the generalizability o f this research. Although it

78

can be argued that computer telephony product manufacturers and software developers in 

1999 are not representative of the high technology industry at-large, we are justified in 

selecting this industry as our population because we are interested in studying products 

based on radically new technologies and the computer telephony industry in 1999 is an 

adequate setting given these research objectives. Nonetheless, our study may suffer from 

an industry-specific and a temporal bias that will make generalizations to other industries 

such as semiconductors or biotechnology, and to other time periods, difficult.

A multiple respondent approach would certainly have improved data reliability. Relying 

on respondents’ recollection of specific events having occurred in the past yields results 

that can be inaccurate and subjective. However, time and cost considerations prevented 

us from using more than one respondent per firm and from gathering additional 

observations. In addition, the number o f t-tests conducted on the set of variables raises 

concerns of an inflated type I error and the possibility that the significant results observed 

are in fact spurious.

Another possible concern with the results relates to the issue of reverse causality. Could 

the relationships between the variables be interpreted in the opposite direction? i.e. when 

technologically new products are unsuccessful, managers increase the extent of user 

involvement. This concern is addressed by invoking the three criteria required to 

established causality: association, temporal precedence, and non-spuriousness of results. 

In this case, we have a certain degree o f association between the variables. We also have 

temporal precedence given that product success is assessed at a point in time when

79

product development is complete. Therefore, success always comes after user 

involvement in new product development and reverse causality cannot be attributed to the 

relationships found in this study.

Finally, the findings must be interpreted carefully. Our hypotheses were supported in 

very specific cases and support for the more general propositions was not obtained with 

this data set. The study can be replicated in other high technology industries in order to 

put the hypotheses to a more stringent test. Similarly, the study can be replicated within 

the same industry at a later point in time to further test the stability of our conclusions.

5.7 

Directions fo r Future Research 

Given its findings well as its limitations, this study points to several avenues for further 

research.  Researchers investigating radical new product development processes may 

wish to focus on the use of specific market research methods such as focus or user 

groups, as well as on customer involvement in pre-development activities as a function of 

product newness. A longitudinal design would also allow researchers to gain deeper 

insight into the evolution of user involvement during the various activities of the product 

development process as well a greater understanding of the specific methods of user 

involvement and the context in which they were used. Other possibilities for improving 

on the research design include using multiple respondents to cross-validate the responses 

and ensure greater reliability of the results. Similarly, a dyadic research design that 

matches developers and users would also improve reliability and provide a more accurate 

description o f user involvement in new product development. A valuable contribution to

SO

this area would be to develop a scale for assessing the extent of user involvement in new 

product development that relies less on managers’ perceptions of their involvement but is 

rooted in specific activities and measures the extent and the strength of the interaction 

between producers and users at different stages and activities of the development process. 

Several sources of archival data can be mined for this type of information. Company 

announcements of limited product releases, beta sites, research agreements, joint product 

development.. .can be used as measures of user-producer interaction for the development 

of new products.

Another interesting research avenue would be to relate this research to Moore’s (1995) 

technology lifecycle framework. Moore argues that firms must beware of “the chasm” 

(Moore, 1991) in the innovation diffusion process when marketing discontinuous new 

technologies. Radically new technologies tend to appeal to a select group o f’techies’ and 

‘early adopters’ and they are frequently the ones that firms rely on to test really new 

technologies. Involving these users too much may lead to products that are too complex 

and that fail to generate any mass-market appeal. Products may also end up incorporating 

particular, idiosyncratic features that only appeal to the users that were involved in the 

tests. Our study provides some initial support for Moore’s hypotheses and additional 

research can further expand on these findings to determine how the model stands up to a 

more robust empirical test o f the propositions. Our research found that new technologies 

that involved end-users more in trials and testing activities were less successful. If the 

end-users involved in new product development are in fact these ‘techies’ and early 

adopters, they are not representative o f the larger market and the product may not appeal 

to the mainstream users and end up as a marketplace failure.

In addition, Moore (1995) argues that once a new technology is accepted by the 

mainstream market and customers start adopting it a very rapid rate, it enters the 

‘tornado’ or the ‘hypergrowth’ phase. Therefore, firms must only be concerned with 

satisfying demand and need to disregard specific customer requirements in order to 

capture as much market share as possible before the ‘tornado’ is over and everyone has 

chosen a vendor. Our results show that when products target known markets, increased 

perceptions of end-user involvement are negatively associated with success. This finding 

also lends support to Moore’s view by showing that in certain instances, being too 

focused on user-defined requirements may be detrimental to success.

There are several interesting ways of building on these results. One would be to assess 

the level of customer involvement in new product development according to the position 

of the product in the technology adoption lifecycle. This requires asking questions to 

determine the characteristics of the buyers of the product to see how they map on to the 

categories describes by Moore i.e. the level of technological understanding o f the buyer, 

the primary motivation for buying, the extent of involvement in the buying or decision 

making process... Another would be to understand how a product’s design changes as it 

evolves from one stage of the lifecycle to the next based on its level of technological 

development or sophistication. An important contribution o f these types o f studies would 

be the development o f an empirically robust typology o f product users and buyers as well 

as a typology of product categories that map on to Moore’s categories i.e. core 

technology, customized solution, ‘whole product’, technological commodity...

APPENDIX C: LINEAR

REGRESSION ASSUMPTIONS

Collinearity statistics such as the variance inflation factors (VIF) are low and do not show 

any evidence of multicollinearity (table 39). A histogram (figure 8) and a normal 

probability plot of the residuals (figure 9) do not show any significant deviations from 

normality. A scatterplot (figure 10) of the residuals and predicted values shows no 

evidence of heteroskedasticity.
