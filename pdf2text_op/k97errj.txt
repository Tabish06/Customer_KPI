Human Resource Management and  Fortune's
Corporate  Reputation  Survey1

Daniel  J. Koys2

This  study  investigates the  relationship  between human  resource  objectives  and
Fortune's  corporate  reputation  score.  Questionnaires  were  received  from  83  human
resource  executives  of  companies  measured  in  Fortune's  survey.  The  questionnaire
measured  the degree  to  which  the following  HR  objectives  underlie  HR  activities:  (1)
treating employees fairly,  (2) improving organizational performance,  and  (3)  complying
with the  law. Results show that a significant,  positive correlation exists between emphasis
placed  on  the fairness  objective  and  corporate  reputation.

KEY WORDS: corporate reputation; human  resource management; employee dignity; employee rights.

Fortune  magazine has conducted  an  annual corporate  reputation  survey since
1982.  Executives  and  financial  professionals  are  asked  to rate  the  10 largest  com-
panies in their own industries on eight key attributes  (two of which deal with human
resources). The  1995  survey  shows that  the  four  most  admired  corporations  are
Rubbermaid, Microsoft,  Coca-Cola,  and Motorola.  The four  least  admired  compa-
nies are  Trans World  Airlines,  Borden,  USAir  Group, and Kmart. The purpose  of
this article is to determine  the relationship between this corporate  reputation  score
and  the  importance  of three  human  resource  management objectives.

One  human resource  objective is to treat  employees fairly. This can be an  ob-
jective in itself (i.e., respecting the dignity of individuals). Other objectives of human
resource management are to improve organization performance and to comply with
the  law.  In  addition  to  (or  instead  of)  being an  objective in  itself,  managers may
be concerned  about  treating employees  fairly  because  they  think that this will en-
courage  better  performance and/or  discourage legal  action.

This raises the question of whether fair treatment is truly an objective of human
resource managers  or whether  it is a  means towards  an end.  The  answer depends
upon  a manager's approach to moral reasoning (Barton,  1995). The utilitarian man-
ager  would  say that  fair  treatment  is a  means  towards  an  end.  A  manager  using

the  human rights  approach  to moral reasoning would say that fair  treatment  is an
end  in itself.

Many human resource  management authors seem to use the  human rights ap-
proach  in that they list  some  notion  of fair  treatment  as a separate  objective.  For
example,  the  following are  all mentioned  as  separate  objectives:  employee  rights
(Osigweh,  1991), individual well-being (Beer,  Spector,  Lawrence, Mills, & Walton,
1985),  a  good  management-employee  relationship  (Foulkes  &  Livemash,  1989),
quality of work life (Schuler & Huber,  1990), equity (Milkovich & Boudreau, 1994),
and  satisfaction (Heneman,  Schwab, Fossum, & Dyer,  1989).

Those  authors also include  some aspect of the performance  objective in their
writing:  employee  responsibilities  (Osigweh,  1991),  organizational effectiveness
(Beer  et  al.,  1985),  productivity (Foulkes  & Livernash,  1989;  Schuler  &  Huber,
1990), efficiency  (Milkovich & Boudreau, 1994), and performance (Heneman  et  al.,
1989).  Other  HR  authors use  performance  as  their  focus  (Bernardin  & Russell,
1993; Myers, 1986;  Noe, Hollenbeck,  Gerhart, & Wright, 1994). This utilitarian ap-
proach  implies  that  they consider  fair  treatment  to  be  a  means  to  an  end.  Thus
there  is no consensus as  to whether  fair  treatment  is a means or  an end.

Neither  is there a consensus  as to whether legal compliance  is a separate  ob-
jective  or  whether  it  is  an  aspect  of  fair  treatment.  Some  authors  consider  legal
compliance to be  a separate  objective (Beer  et  al., 1985;  Schuler  & Huber,  1990),
but others include  it as a type of fairness objective (Cascio,  1989;  Heneman et  al.,
1989).

This  article  considers  fair  treatment,  organizational  performance,  and  legal
compliance to be  separate  (though related)  objectives. It proposes  that the  degree
of importance HR executives place on the first two objectives is positively correlated
with Fortune's  corporate  reputation  score. That score  is based  on averaging ratings
on eight corporate  characteristics: ability to  attract, develop,  and keep key people;
quality of management; innovativeness; long-term investment value; community and
environmental responsibility; quality of products  and  services; financial  soundness;
and  use of corporate  assets.

Both  the  human  rights  approach  and  the  utilitarian  approach  support  the
proposition  that the fairness objective is related to corporate reputation. The human
rights approach  argues that fairness is actually a part  of the  concept  of reputation
(Velasquez & Bowie, 1988). The utilitarian  approach says that the fairness objective
is related  to  corporate  reputation  because it contributes  to  the firm's  ability to  at-
tract, develop,  and keep key people.  Several empirical studies have shown that per-
ceptions  of  fair  treatment  are  indeed  positively  correlated  with  loyalty  and
commitment to  the  organization  (Cook  & Wall,  1980;  Koys,  1991;  Mottaz,  1988;
Ogilvie,  1986).

The  importance  of organization  performance is expected  to  be  positively re-
lated  to  corporate  reputation  because economic performance is a major  factor in
the corporate  reputation  survey (Fombrun  & Shanley, 1990). Good labor-manage-
ment relations has been shown to be strongly correlated  with an organization's eco-
nomic performance  (Katz, Kochan, & Gobeille,  1983). Further,  the  importance of
this objective should  be  related  to corporate  reputation  because  "quality products
and  services" is one of the  characteristics  rated  in the  Fortune  reputation  survey.


Human  Resource Management and  fortune's  Corporate  Reputation  Survey

The  Baldrige National Quality Award criteria  (U.S. Dept. of Commerce,  1995)  and
some empirical studies (Blackburn & Rosen, 1993; Hart & Schlesinger, 1991) show
that  certain human resource  management activities are  indeed  associated with the
quality of a firm's products and  services.

Legal  compliance  is  an  important objective for  HR  managers. However,  its
importance  should  not  be related  to corporate  reputation.  First  of all, legal  com-
pliance  is not  one  of  the  eight  characteristics  of Fortune's  corporate  reputation
score.  Second, one can just  as easily argue  that  these two variables are positively
correlated  as  negatively correlated.  On the  one  hand, some  line managers  in  un-
successful  firms  may be pressured  to  "cut  corners"  and  thus violate  the  law.  HR
managers would consider legal compliance to be  important because they would be
working  to correct  those  problems.  On  the  other  hand, HR  managers  in highly
successful firms may consider legal compliance to be important because they would
be working to  prevent potential  problems.

The  Lexus on-line data base supports the  proposition  that there  is no  corre-
lation  between corporate  reputation  and  the  importance  of  the  legal  compliance
objective. It  contains judges' decisions (though  not jury  decisions)  at  all levels of
the  state and federal courts. We found  24 recent  HR-related  cases involving firms
with  the  highest reputations  and  23 recent  HR-related  cases  involving firms with
the lowest reputations (see Table I). The ABI/INFORM on-line data base was also
searched. Since  1991,  the  companies with  the  top  30 corporate  reputations  were
mentioned  in  7  HR-related  cases.  The  companies with  the  bottom  30  corporate
reputations were  mentioned in 4 HR-related  cases.  Of  course,  not  all legal com-
plaints are decided  by a judge or reported  in ABI/INFORM,  but these are  indica-
tions  that  the  importance of  the  legal  compliance  objective  does  not  vary with
corporate reputation.

Thus, three objectives for  HR managers are  to treat employees  fairly,  to im-
prove organizational performance, and to comply with the law. We hypothesize  that
corporate  reputation is:

1.  positively correlated  with  the  importance of the  fairness objective,
2.  positively correlated  with the importance of the performance objective, and
3.  not correlated  with  the  importance of the  legal compliance objective.

METHODOLOGY

Questionnaires  were  sent  to  the  Human Resource  Vice Presidents  of all 306
firms  rated  by  Fortune  in  1988  (Schultz,  1988).  The  initial  mailing produced  62
responses;  a follow-up mailing (to nonrespondents)  produced 21 more, for a  total
of 83 (27.2% response  rate). There was no significant  difference  between the mean
corporate  reputation  scores  of the  respondents  and the  nonrespondents  (t  =  .02,
n.s.).

Eighty four  percent  of the  respondents reported  that their jobs were  in  EEO
category  1 (officials  and  managers) and  15% reported  being in  EEO  category 2

(professionals).  On  average,  respondents were  44 years old  and  had  12.9  years of
service  in their  firms.

A  modified version  of  Tsui's  (1987)  101-item  questionnaire  measuring  per-
sonnel  department  activities  was used.  Three  items  from  each  of  Tsui's  eight
categories  of  HR  activities were  selected  (some  words were  slightly modified).
The eight categories of activities include the following: staffing,  organization/em-
ployee  development,  compensation,  employee  relations,  employee  support,  legal
requirements/compliance,  labor/union  relations,  and  policy  adherence.  The  re-
searcher  chose  items that were related  to  all three human resource  objectives (see
Appendix for  items).

Subjects were  asked  to  state whether  or not  their  personnel  department  per-
formed  each  of  the  24 activities. If the  answer was positive, the  respondents were

asked  whether the  activity was performed  to  treat  people  justly  and  fairly. In  ad-
dition, they also indicated whether the department  performed each activity to  fulfill
legal  requirements  and/or to improve organizational performance  (1 =  disagree,  5
=  agree). The  averages  of  these  three  sets  of  responses  defined  the  emphases
placed  on the three  HR  objectives. All three  scales exhibited  high internal  consis-
tency  (i.e., coefficients alpha were 0.91,  0.89,  and  0.92, respectively).

If  an  activity  was  not  performed,  then,  of  course,  the  objective  was not  an
issue.  Further,  the respondents could indicate that they did not know the  objective
for  an  activity. Both situations were coded  as missing data and  not included  in  the
analysis.

Organizational  reputation  was measured  by Fortune's  corporate  reputation
score.  Fortune  asked  8,000 executives,  outside  directors,  and  financial  analysts  to
rate  firms  on the  eight characteristics  listed  above on  an  11-point  scale  (0  =  low,
10  =  high). The  average  rating  is  used  as  the  measure  of  corporate  reputation.
(The  ratings  of  the  eight  characteristics  are  not  readily  available  from Fortune.)
Although  there  is some debate  over the use  of the Fortune  survey as a measure of
firm  performance,  its frequent use in scholarly  studies  (e.g., Brown & Perry,  1994;
McGuire,  Schneeweis, & Branch, 1990)  attests  to its validity as a measure of repu-
tation.

Each questionnaire contained a code number to match the questionnaires with
the  reputation  score.  The  respondents  were  told  that  company  names  would  be
kept  confidential.

RESULTS

Correlation  analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Table II shows that there
is a  significant  positive  correlation  between corporate  reputation  and  the  impor-
tance of the fairness  objective.  The table also shows a positive,  though  insignificant,
correlation between reputation and the importance of the organization  performance
objective. There  is an  insignificant negative correlation between  the  legal  compli-
ance  objective  and reputation.

DISCUSSION

As hypothesized,  the  emphasis  placed  on  the  fair  treatment  objective  is sig-
nificantly  and positively correlated with corporate  reputation.  Contrary to expecta-
tions,  the  emphasis  placed  on  the  organizational  performance  objective  is  not
significantly related  to reputation  (though the correlation was positive).

Human  resource  executives working in more  admired  firms  appear  to  place
more emphasis on treating employees fairly  than do HR  executives working in less
admired firms. This may mean that the primary way they influence corporate repu-
tation is by encouraging  the  fair  treatment of employees either  as an  end  in itself
or  as a way to  attract  and retain  qualified  people.

Given that this is a correlational  study, an alternative explanation of the results
is that more  admired firms have more organizational slack and can afford  to place
a greater  emphasis on the fair treatment objective. Although our data do not allow
us to  refute  that possibility, it goes against accepted  theories of management. Our
theories  do  not  tell  managers  to  downplay the  fair  treatment  objective until  the
organization  becomes  successful. Rather,  they suggest that  the  fair  treatment  ob-
jective and the  performance objective are  both important from  the start.  Further,
the  Baldrige Award criteria include both objectives.

It is surprising that the positive correlation between the performance objective
and corporate reputation  is statistically insignificant. This may be due to the content
of the particular items used in the survey. The items have a foundation in employee
well-being and satisfaction as well as in performance and compliance. For  example,
the  performance  appraisal  item  has a foundation in  treating  people  fairly,  in im-
proving their performance, and in avoiding law suits. However, different  items such
as those  related  to labor  cost  control  may have been  more  directly related to  or-
ganization performance. Future research must include more of these types of items.

Management Implications

An  implication  of this study is that it  is beneficial for  human resource execu-
tives to  explain the  purposes behind their  activities. It  appears  that it is better to say
that  activities are designed  to  treat people fairly  than  to  say  that  they  are designed  to
keep  the  firm  out  of  court  (even  if  the  latter  is also  true).  We  now  discuss what
managers can do  to  encourage  employee well-being and  fair  treatment.

Philosophers argue that people have human rights that are not necessarily em-
bodied in laws (Kant, 1964). Treating employees fairly can be accomplished through
human resource activities that honor the two basic human rights of liberty and well-
being (Velasquez & Bowie, 1988). For  example, employers  and employees  respect
each others' rights to freely enter and leave employment relationships. Pay, benefits,
training, and retraining activities influence employees' economic well-being, whereas
health  and  safety  activities affect  their physical well-being.

Employees  also can be treated  fairly by following the  principles of distributive
justice  and procedural  justice. Distributive justice occurs when  the ratio  of  inputs
to  outcomes  for  a  person  is  equal  to  that  ratio  for  some  comparison  person

99

(Homans, 1961;  see also Adams, 1965). For  example, salary surveys, job evaluation,
and  performance appraisals  are  designed to  distribute pay equitably.

Procedural  justice seeks to assure fairness in the procedures used to make  the
distribution (Folger & Greenberg, 1985). Procedures are considered  fair when they
are consistently  applied and are free  of bias, when they use accurate data and allow
for  correction  of mistakes, and when they allow consideration  of all relevant  parties'
viewpoints (Leventhal, Kruza, & Fry, 1980). For example, procedural justice in com-
pensation  is said  to be characterized by pay systems where accurate pay information
is available and  communicated to employees, where employee representatives  par-
ticipate  in decision  making, and where  appeal  procedures  are  available  (Wallace
&  Fay,  1988).

CONCLUSION

The  positive correlation between corporate  reputation and  the  fair  treatment
objective  gives credence  to the  idea that fair  treatment is a legitimate objective of
human  resource management. Recently, Fortune reported  that its Corporate  Repu-
tation  Survey  respondents  cited  "quality of management" as the primary determi-
nant  of  a  company's reputation  (Ballen,  1992).  Perhaps improving the  quality of
human resource management means improving the ways management treats its em-
ployees.  It  may also  be  that  concern  for  employee  well-being  and  satisfaction  is
related  to  quality and customer satisfaction.
