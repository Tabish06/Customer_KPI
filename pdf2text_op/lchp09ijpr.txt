socialisation,

Purchasing is increasingly seen as an important strategic activity of the firm.
However, there is little evidence examining the effects of strategic purchasing on
a firm’s inter-organisational supply management practices and performance. The
purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of strategic purchasing on the supply
management practices of
integration and supplier
responsiveness, together with relationship performance. Using empirical data
collected from 111 United Kingdom purchasing executives, a structural equation
model is used to test the theoretical framework. The results provide support for
four of the six hypotheses developed. Strategic purchasing was found to have an
indirect, significant effect on improving buyer performance, acting through
supplier integration. Strategic purchasing also had a significant effect on the use
of socialisation mechanisms, but not on supplier responsiveness. Our research
indicates that close, long-term supplier relationships can lead to the creation of
relational rents. Implications for future research and suggestions for improving
the rigour of strategic purchasing research are made.

1. Introduction

The purchasing function is becoming widely recognised as an important contributor to
strategic success, helping firms meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive and
dynamic environment (Monczka et al. 2000). To fulfil this strategic role, the purchasing
role within many firms has undergone a marked shift evolving from a tactical service
function to a strategic,
integrative process (Carter and Narasimhan 1996, Carr and
Pearson 2002). Strategic purchasing allows the function to play a greater role in corporate
planning, reduces a firm’s exposure to opportunistic behaviours, and is more likely to lead
to successful collaborative relationships (Chen et al. 2004). However, realising the gains
from strategic purchasing is difficult, with research suggesting that it is a capability

requiring years to develop through focused leadership and change management (Handfield
and Nichols Jr 1999).

Early studies on strategic purchasing emphasised the need for an elevated role for
purchasing in the development and implementation of corporate strategy (Reck and Long
1988), while other research has examined the factors underlying the strategic purchasing
construct (Carter and Narasimhan 1996, Carr and Smeltzer 1997, Narasimhan et al. 2001).
A number of studies have shed light on the impact of strategic purchasing on the business
practice within the firm. Carr and Pearson (1999), for example, examined the effect of
strategic purchasing on financial performance, while a later study investigated the
antecedents of strategic purchasing and effects on performance (Carr and Pearson 2002).
More recently, Chen et al. (2004) explored the impact of strategic purchasing on supply
management capabilities and financial performance. However, a critical mass of empirical
work analysing the extent to which purchasing strategy influences purchasing practice has
yet to develop (Chen and Paulraj 2004).

In this study we explore the effects of strategic purchasing on external parties,
specifically the inter-organisational relationships with key suppliers. We argue that it is not
enough for a firm to possess a strategic purchasing orientation; they must also create
conditions that allow the buyer and supplier to contribute and develop the relationship.
Whilst there has been a wide variety of research focusing on inter-firm relationship
management, this paper contributes to knowledge by explaining how buyer performance
can be enhanced through both process and structural practices. Three supply management
practices are identified which facilitate effective relationship performance with key
suppliers, namely: socialisation activities; process integration; and supply base respon-
siveness. These variables reinforce one another and act to make the connection between
the foundations established by strategic purchasing and the returns derived from a firm’s
supplier relationships. We add to the literature by specifying a unique set of variables
which have not been explicitly modelled in this context, and show that while strategic
purchasing can create alignment with long-term business strategy, it must also be deployed
into operational processes in order to drive advantage.

We develop a series of hypotheses linking the various constructs, and test them via a
mail survey of 111 manufacturing firms located in the United Kingdom. A structural
equation model, using AMOS 6.0, is then used to test the predictive power of the model,
encompassing all the constructs of interest simultaneously. The research outcomes then
derived from this study provide a rich context for future researchers to follow.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. We first provide a review of the extant
literature, focusing on strategic purchasing and supply management practices. The
conceptual model and rationale for each hypothesised relationship is then developed.
Section 4 discusses the research methodology, with the discussion and implications of the
study’s findings then presented. The paper concludes with a review of the limitations of the
study and suggestions for future research.

2. Literature review

2.1 The resource-based view and strategic purchasing

The traditional resource-based view (RBV) argues that supernormal earnings result from
resources controlled by a single firm (Barney 1991). However, the rapid growth of


International Journal of Production Research

collaborative relationships across many industries has expanded this focus, with scholarly
attention beginning to recognise the importance of resources which lie outside of a firm’s
boundaries (Mathews 2003, Duschek 2004). Complementary resource combinations
between partnering firms can be a source of competitive advantage, with the idiosyncratic
nature of the relational assets making imitation by competitors difficult (Gulati et al.
2000). Our study is thus positioned within a framework of collaborative advantage (Dyer
and Singh 1998), rather than one of competitive advantage.

Collaborative advantage is a resource that requires a long-term orientation and may
ultimately create greater benefits than a traditional zero-sum based approach to
competition (Dyer 2000). Specifically, we rely on the relational view (Dyer and Singh
1998), an extension of RBV incorporating social network theory (Granovetter 1985,
Burt 1992, Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven 1996). Through co-operation, partners can
profit from rents that can only be generated by working jointly. The ability of the firm
to derive these relational rents is at least,
in part, dependent on how effective the
supply function is in building and leveraging collaborative partnerships with suppliers.
Dyer and Nobeoka (2000), for example, provide evidence that Toyota’s approach to
creating and managing a high-performance knowledge-sharing production network
generates considerable advantage for both the company and its suppliers. Later
studies
relational benefits are long-term and sustainable in nature
(Choi and Hong 2002).

2.2 Strategic purchasing

Purchasing is increasingly regarded as a strategic weapon, centred on its ability to create
collaborative relationships for firm advantage (Carr and Smeltzer 1999). Numerous
authors have highlighted the key concepts of strategic purchasing, including a proactive,
long-term focus, and managing supplier relationships strategically (Reck and Long 1988,
Carter and Narasimhan 1993, Carr and Smeltzer 1997). Consistent with previous
literature, we define strategic purchasing as a planning process that will
‘direct all
purchasing activities toward opportunities consistent with the firm’s capabilities to achieve
its long-term goals’ (Carr and Smeltzer 1997, p. 200).

Our study, grounded in the relational view, argues that partnerships with suppliers
can have a strong positive influence on firm performance through the development of
joint resources and the exchange of valuable knowledge with these individual partners
(Dyer 1996, Dyer and Nobeoka 2000). In practice, many firms fail to realise these
benefits when they implement sourcing agreements at a lower negotiated price, but do
not follow through with the relational processes that capture these benefits over the
course of the contract (Monczka et al. 1998). However, the ability to extract such
benefits from supplier relationships is also linked to the way these relationships are
managed. For example, those relationships characterised by close interactions and
successful process integration between buyer and supplier are better able to create,
coordinate and protect joint resources for a sustained competitive advantage (Dyer and
Singh 1998). Thus,
it is not enough for a firm to possess a strategic purchasing
orientation, they must also create conditions which allow the buyer and supplier to
contribute and develop the relationship. Various supply management practices facilitate
this process, and are discussed below.

2.3 Supply management practices

2.3.1 Socialisation mechanisms
The concept of socialisation is well established in organisational behaviour research. The
early seminal research of Van Maanen (1976) into new employee role socialisation led to
additional studies applied to other fields including goal and value orientation (Kraimer
1997), consumer behaviour (Moschis and Churchill 1978), ethical sensitivity (Sparks and
Hunt 1998), and joint venture agreements (O’Donnell 2000). Within a supply chain
context, socialisation has received limited attention (cf. Cousins et al. 2006). Supply chain
socialisation refers to the level of interaction and communication between various actors
of each firm, leading to personal familiarity, improved communication, and problem
solving. Socialisation mechanisms, therefore, relate to the processes by which each
party acquires knowledge of the other enterprise’s social values and norms (Van Maanen
and Schein 1979). The trust, respect and reciprocity built
from this engagement
increases the willingness of parties to make relationship-specific investments (such as
human and intellectual assets), which can be leveraged for advantage in the marketplace
(Dyer 1997).

2.3.2 Supplier integration
Integration with suppliers has often been cited as an effective strategy for improving
business performance (Narasimhan and Das 2001, Rosenzweig et al. 2003). We focus on
integration with suppliers at the operational level. Operational integration is intended to
make the supplier an extension of the firm’s factory, emphasising continuity of supply and
an end-to-end pipeline (Handfield and Bechtel 2002). Mechanisms for facilitating this
integration include the participation of suppliers in design, procurement, and production,
as well using ordering systems and information technology to exchange information (Dyer
1996). The development of a strategic partnership approach is fundamental to the success
of supplier integration efforts (Wagner et al. 2002), with integrating suppliers into a well-
managed supply chain having a lasting effect on the competitiveness of the entire supply
chain (Choi and Hartley 1996).

2.3.3 Supplier responsiveness
Supplier characteristics can have a large impact on the performance of the buyer firm,
both in theory (Mathews 2003) and in practice (Hoetker 2005). Aligning the supply base to
the firm and its environment is a key determinant of supply chain performance (Fisher
1997), requiring purchasing to take a strategic focus (Chen et al. 2004) and to work on
a much more ‘integrated’ basis with suppliers (Handfield and Bechtel 2002). We use the
idea of supply base responsiveness to reflect the degree to which a firm’s key suppliers are
able to customise products, be responsive to delivery changes, and to accept late ‘mix’ and
volume changes. Supply chain responsiveness can thus be a source of
increased
profitability (Towill et al. 2003) and competitive advantage (Stalk and Hout 1990).

by a proactive purchasing function leads to the development of certain supply practices,
namely socialisation, integration and responsiveness. In turn, these practices act as the
conduits through which the relationship is built, knowledge transferred, and performance
improvements for the buyer achieved. Each of the hypothesised relationships is developed
below.

3.1 Linking strategic purchasing and supply management practices

Strategic purchasing requires a proactive long-term view to supplier relationship
management, leading to closer, co-operative links with key suppliers (Chen et al. 2004).
One means of forging these links is through bridging mechanisms that transcend the
horizontal boundaries between the firms. Socialisation mechanisms fulfil this role, acting
to structure the engagement, communicate expectations and share useful knowledge
between exchange partners. Examples
teams, co-location,
regularly scheduled meetings and conferences, and matrix style reporting structures.
Although we do not specify the exact mix of structures that produce the desired results,
cross-functional teams combined with regular supplier team meetings are a ‘bedrock’ for
enhanced team interaction (Handfield et al. 1999). We argue that as the purchasing
function adopts a strategic orientation, the senior management team will increase its use of
socialisation mechanisms with suppliers as a means of transmitting their cultural values
and signalling their commitment to a collaborative, long-term relationship. Thus:

include cross-functional

Hypothesis 1. Strategic purchasing has a positive effect on the level of socialisation
mechanisms.

A strategic purchasing orientation necessitates a co-operative approach to the
management of key suppliers. De Toni and Nassimbeni (1999), for example, found that a
long-term relationship perspective increased the intensity of buyer–supplier co-ordination.


2654

B. Lawson et al.

Each party must commit relational assets, both human and physical, to developing this
relationship and enable closer co-ordination of activities. Closer integration with suppliers is
a means of safeguarding investments specific to the relationship (Heide and Stump 1995),
and increasing the willingness of the supplier to make relationship-specific asset investments
(Dyer 1996). Thus, as a firm adopts a strategic purchasing orientation they will seek to
increase the level of operational integration with their key suppliers. Thus:

Hypothesis 2. Strategic purchasing has a positive effect on the level of supplier integration

Strategic purchasing also requires a firm to specify the types of relationships they wish
to form with the supply base. In recent years, firms have restructured their supply bases
through a process of supplier tiering to reduce the number of suppliers they deal with.
First tier suppliers then become the focus of intensive collaboration, where the buyer
and supplier align their various organisational systems to enable very close interaction
(Stuart et al. 1998). This alignment
is designed to synergistically enhance skills,
share learning, develop new designs and reduce costs by taking out wasteful processes
(Womack and Jones 1994). We propose that as firms pursue a strategic purchasing
orientation, the supply base will be more suited to the buyer, and more responsive to their
needs. Thus:

Hypothesis 3. Strategic purchasing has a positive effect on the responsiveness characteristics of
a firm’s suppliers

3.2 Linking supply management practices to buyer performance improvement

We examine the effect of supply chain management practices on buyer performance
improvement, specifically on dimensions of product development, process design and
product quality. The importance of socialisation, supplier integration and supplier
responsiveness in driving performance has a high degree of face validity, especially in the
case of specific industries. Take, for example, the automotive industry where Japanese
automakers, such as Toyota and Honda, have gained large performance advantages
over General Motors and Ford. Each of these companies have strategic purchasing
models in place, but Toyota and Honda achieve greater benefits, due to the way they
have implemented various supply management practices to drive execution with core
suppliers.

To unlock the value that exists in the buyer–supplier exchange, firms will need to
effectively manage their inter-firm relationships. Socialisation mechanisms help align and
adapt buyer activities to changes in the environment. The shared norms and co-operation
created via socialisation helps increase information exchange, co-operation between the
parties and likelihood of shared resource investments. Thus, higher levels of socialisation
are likely to result in smoother information flows necessary for effective communication of
new product designs, suggestions for process improvements, and higher product quality.
This is developed in the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 4. Socialisation mechanisms are positively related with higher levels of buyer
performance improvement


International Journal of Production Research

2655

While socialisation mechanisms focus on the social side of the relationship, the harder
structural elements of the process are equally important. Supplier integration reflects
co-specialised resources, and may be an important source of inter-organisational rents.
Integration with suppliers has been associated with improved business performance across
a range of industries and settings (Narasimhan and Kim 2002, Droge et al. 2004).
Specifically, supplier integration results in higher levels of reliability, delivery times,
flexibility and customer satisfaction (Rosenzweig et al. 2003), ultimately making the focal
company more competitive (Christopher 1998). Supply chain integration implies greater
alignment between the supply chain and the company’s strategies. We argue that as levels
of supplier integration increases, buyer performance will improve as measured by product
design, process design and product quality. Thus:

Hypothesis 5. Supplier integration is positively associated with higher levels of buyer
performance improvement

Kraljic (1983) wrote that ‘. . . with traditional sourcing patterns crumbling under the
pressures of political, economic and technological change, no company whose
profitability could be threatened by a sudden scarcity of an important raw material
or the loss of a key supplier can safely continue to rely on reactive purchasing policies’.
Twenty-four years later global firms are still facing these same concerns. In order to
mitigate these basic sourcing risks firms have focused on developing ‘responsiveness’
within their supply base. This has been achieved through a variety of mechanisms. Lee
(2004, p. 104) argues that firms who are able to extract competitive advantage from
their supply base have supply chains that are ‘. . . agile, adaptable and aligned’.
the Japanese keiretsu supply
Moreover, Ahmajian and Lincoln (2001) argue that
network offer large benefits of flexibility and control. Araujo et al. (1999, 2003)
maintain that supplier resources must be aligned with those of the buyer firm in order
to attain a competitive advantage, while Bensaou and Anderson (1999) show that
specific investments in the supplier relationship led to greater supplier responsiveness,
and in turn, improved supplier performance. Flexible suppliers are better able to align
with the buyer’s supply chain, and provide input into the design of products, processes
and quality procedures. Following these previous studies, we argue that firms who
possess higher levels of supplier responsiveness are more likely to extract gains from
their supplier relationships.

Hypothesis 6. Supplier responsiveness is positively associated with higher levels of buyer
performance improvement

4. Methods

This study aims to conduct explanatory research examining the unstructured organisa-
tional problem of strategic purchasing and its effect on practices and performance.
A positivist epistemological stance was adopted, guiding us to the development and testing
of hypotheses grounded in theory. Survey methods are typically applied to help achieve
these positivist goals (Meredith et al. 1989). Surveys have been used extensively in


2656

production and operations management as a method to test theory-driven expectations of
the relationships among variables (Malhotra and Grover 1998).

4.1 Sample and procedure

A sample of 750 United Kingdom manufacturing firms were surveyed from a database
held by The Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS), UK. An internet-
based survey was administered, with each respondent selected based on job function
(purchasing manager or equivalent), plant size (at least 100 employees) and industry sector
by SIC code. One hundred and twenty eight responses were received, of which 17 were
deemed unusable due to missing data. The effective response rate was thus 14.8%
(111/750), comparing favourably to other web-based studies (e.g. Klassen and Jacobs
2001).
Of

the responding firms, 45% were general manufacturing, 13.5% electronics,
10% specialist manufacturing, 9.9% automotive, and 10.8% were in industries classified
‘other’, such as chemicals and pharmaceutical. The final 11% of firms had no response to
industry classification. The response by position held within the firm was Vice President/
Director (14%), Senior Manager (57%), and junior manager (29%). By functional area of
responsibility, purchasing returned the greatest number of responses (89.9%), with the
remainder composed of R&D and manufacturing managers. No significant mean
differences were detected between either of these groups. The average experience in the
industry was 9.06 years providing support that our informants were also knowledgeable
about the issues under investigation.

We conducted pilot testing with four academics and nine industry contacts to assess the
scale items’ face validity, and to provide feedback on the content, design and usability of
the survey website. Some minor content and design changes were made at this stage.
A letter introducing the survey was mailed by CIPS to senior purchasing managers in
February 2004. The letter explained the purpose of the research, and contained a link to
the survey website. Efforts were made to enhance the response rate by sending a follow-up
email two weeks after the initial mailing, and by offering respondents a composite
summary of results (Forza 2002).

Tests for non-response bias were conducted by comparing early respondents (responses
received within the first two weeks) and later respondents (responses received within the
third week or later) (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). A t-test of difference was conducted
on firm size (employees and sales), and mean responses to each variable. No statistically
significant differences were identified at p 5 0.05. In addition, we gathered data on sales,
employees and industry from 22 purchasing executives who had logged onto the survey
website, but did not progress to answering the survey. A t-test of difference along these
dimensions between these non-responders and responders was conducted, with no
statistically significant differences (p 5 0.05) identified.

4.2 Unit of analysis

The unit of analysis was the dyadic relationship between buyer and a single strategic
supplier. We identified purchasing managers as key respondents who possessed knowledge
of the organisation’s purchasing function and supplier relationships. These respondents
were asked to answer the survey with reference to a specific strategic supplier relationship
of which they had detailed knowledge. As a further control we asked whether they had


International Journal of Production Research

2657

primary responsibility for the management of that relationship, giving us confidence that
the respondents were knowledgeable regarding the items under investigation.

4.3 Operationalisation of variables

The following measures consisted of items ranging from 1, ‘not at all’, to 7, ‘a very great
extent’. All items are reported in Appendix A. Strategic purchasing was measured using
a three item scale validated by Carr and Pearson (1999), and developed by Carter and
Narasimhan (1993) and Hendrick and Ellram (1993). The items assessed a firm’s approach
to purchasing strategy through the existence of a formal long range plan, the review of the
strategic plan to match changes in corporate strategy, and the inclusion of various types of
relationships to be established with suppliers. Although alternative items have been
proposed (e.g. Chen et al. 2004), we believe that the scale used in this study continues to
offer the most effective and parsimonious measure of assessing the strategic impact of
purchasing on firm-level strategy making.

Supply management practices included socialisation processes, supplier integration and
supply base responsiveness. Socialisation mechanisms were assessed using a three-item
scale examining the structures and process in place to facilitate socialisation activities
between the buyer and supplier, such as cross-functional teams, joint workshops, and
co-location (O’Donnell 2000, Cousins et al. 2006). Supplier responsiveness was measured
using a four-item scale assessing the responsiveness of a firm’s suppliers, including their
ability to undertake customisation, and responsiveness to schedule and volume changes.
We measured supplier integration using a four-item scale validated by Narasimhan and
Kim (2002) and others (Monczka and Morgan 1996, Carr and Pearson 1999). The items
included the degree of strategic partnership with suppliers, level of supplier participation in
design, procurement and production, and the establishment of quick ordering systems.

Our performance outcome variable, buyer performance improvement was measured
using a three-item scale adapted from Kotabe et al. (2003) assessing the degree to which
the relationship had, over the past two to three years, resulted in improved product design,
process design and product quality for the buyer firm.

5. Statistical analysis

5.1 Confirmatory factor analysis

A two-step process of analysis (Anderson and Gerbing 1988), with AMOS 6.0 (Arbuckle
2005), was employed to test our hypotheses. First, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was
employed to provide a test of construct validity and unidimensionality using latent and
manifest variables. Model identification was achieved by fixing one of the loadings in each
construct to a value of 1.0, and having a minimum of three-indicators for each variable.
Each indicator within the measurement model was then checked for low factor loadings
(50.40), high residuals (i.e. normalised residuals 42.58), and modification indices
(43.84). No anomalies were identified. A check for negative variance and high item
correlations revealed no further areas of concern. Table 1 provides the loadings and error
terms of the manifest variables onto each latent variable.

We assessed model fit using four indices: the chi-square test; the comparative fit index
(CFI); the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI); and the root-mean-square error of approximation

[2(109)¼ 120.92, p¼ 0.205; CFI¼ 0.988; TLI ¼ 0.986; and
to the data was good:
RMSEA¼ 0.032]. A number of procedures were then followed to check for convergent
validity (Bagozzi and Yi 1988) and discriminant validity (Fornell and Larcker 1981,
Anderson and Gerbing 1988). The convergent validity of the scales (the extent to which the
measurement items reflect a common underlying construct) was supported, with estimated
coefficients of all indicators being significant (t 4 2.0). The average variance extracted
(AVE), which measures the variance captured by the indicators relative to measurement
error, was also greater than the 0.50 minimum necessary to justify the use of a construct
(Hair et al. 1998). Composite reliability values also provide a further assessment of internal
consistency. A minimum value of 0.70 is recommended as it indicates that around 0.50 of
the variance (the squared loading) can be attributed to the construct of interest (Fornell
and Larcker 1981). The composite reliabilities, which ranged from 0.78 to 0.91, were
excellent.

All tests of discriminant validity were supportive. That is, no confidence intervals of the
correlations for the constructs (
 values) included 1.0 (p 5 0.05) (Anderson and Gerbing
1988), and the square of the intercorrelations between two constructs, 
2, was less than the
AVE estimates of the two constructs. This was true for all pairs of constructs (Fornell and
Larcker 1981). These results suggest the five scales and their 17 items are reliable and valid
in this study. The inter-item correlations, Cronbach’s alpha, composite reliabilities (CR),
and average variance extracted (AVE) values are shown in Table 2. We now proceed to
test the structural model.

The structural model was tested, with maximum likelihood estimation, and the covariance
matrix used as input to the model. No over-identifying paths were identified. The fit
indices for the structural model indicate an acceptable fit to the data: [2(113)¼ 138.76,
p¼ 0.05; CFI¼ 0.975; TLI ¼ 0.970; and RMSEA¼ 0.046]. The structural model explained
37% of the variation in buyer performance improvement. The results are presented in
Figure 2, and show that four out of the six proposed hypotheses were supported.

B. Lawson et al.

The results show that the majority of constructs are related in the theoretically
predicted manner. There was a statistically significant association linking strategic
purchasing to socialisation mechanisms (
¼ 0.40, p 5 0.001) and supplier integration
(
¼ 0.48, p 5 0.001), providing support for H1 and H2, respectively. No support was
found for H3, linking strategic purchasing and supplier responsiveness (
¼ 0.14, ns).
Supply management capabilities also have positive and significant associations with
performance. The hypothesised relationship between socialisation mechanisms and
buyer performance improvement (
¼ 0.13, ns) was non-significant, thus H4 was not
supported. Significant relationships were, however, found linking supplier integration
to buyer performance improvement (
¼ 0.49, p 5 0.001) and supplier responsiveness
(
¼ 0.29, p 5 0.001), supporting H5 and H6,
to buyer performance improvement
respectively. Strategic purchasing has a significant total indirect effect on performance
(
¼ 0.33, p 5 0.001), operating through supplier integration (
¼ 0.23, p 5 0.01).

In addition, we added a direct path from strategic purchasing to buyer per-
formance improvement as a formal test of mediation. The difference in 2-values
between the baseline hypothesised model and the mediated model (2 (1)¼ 0.29, ns),
with one degree of freedom, is a test of the significance of the added path. As this
difference is not significant, we may conclude that the direct path from strategic
purchasing to buyer performance improvement is insignificant, and therefore strategic
purchasing acts through supply management practices to achieve improvements in
performance.

6. Discussion

The purpose of this study was to examine the role of strategic purchasing on supply chain
management practices and performance. We investigated this question in the context of
medium-to-large United Kingdom manufacturing firms. Our results provide empirical
support that strategic purchasing is significantly and positively related to higher levels of
socialisation and supplier process integration, as well as having a significant, indirect effect
on buyer performance improvements.

A number of contributions are highlighted. First, this study represents an empirical test
of the relational view. Our performance variable, buyer performance improvement,
measured the returns directly attributable to the relationship between buyer and key
supplier. We showed that a strategic purchasing orientation generated relational rents for
the firm. Close relationships with suppliers, where trust and cooperation is paramount,
rather than competition and opportunism, is thus recommended as an avenue for value
creation.

Second, we provide a more detailed investigation of the way in which strategic
purchasing impacts on supplier relationships,
including boundary-spanning socialisa-
tion activities and integration of operational processes with suppliers. Interestingly,
strategic purchasing did not have a significant effect on the responsiveness of a firm’s
supply base. We partially answer the call of Chen et al. (2004) in broadening the
examination of strategic purchasing to other relationship variables. However, more
work is still required to examine the impact of strategic purchasing on supplier
management.

6.1 Impact of strategic purchasing on supply management practices

Our study had proposed three hypotheses relating strategic purchasing to supply
management practices. Two of the three relationships were significant and in expected
directions. Strategic purchasing led to a significantly increased use of socialisation
mechanisms with suppliers. Close communication and co-operation with key suppliers is
a necessary outcome of strategic purchasing, with socialisation mechanisms being an
important boundary-spanning process facilitating this goal. Socialisation mechanisms are
beginning to receive increased attention within the general management
literature
(Oh et al. 2004, Inkpen and Tsang 2005), and also specifically within the supply chain
management literature (Linderman et al. 2004, Cousins et al. 2006). The results show that
socialisation mechanisms are an outcome of greater strategic purchasing and can have
a significant role to play in the development of supplier relationships, particularly in
building informal norms and information flows.

Strategic purchasing was also highly associated with increased supplier integration.
Strategic purchasing promotes closer ties with suppliers, and encouraging relationship-
specific investments, such as ordering systems, sharing information through IT, and
involving suppliers in procurement and production. Purchasing being seen as strategic
(important)
to the organisation also gives it extra bargaining power within the
organisation itself. This can have knock-on effects improving internal problem solving,
being able to lead selection teams and being viewed as a value generator. For example,
a semiconductor firm we interviewed decided to outsource its production to a contract
manufacturer in China. The initial process of strategic purchasing and supplier selection
was simple. However, once production began, quality problems became rampant, until the
firm formally committed to establishing on-site operational personnel to resolve these
issues. Integration of processes thus played a critical role in cementing the benefits
associated with the outsourcing decision.

Interestingly, strategic purchasing was not significantly related to improvements in
supplier responsiveness. It may be that some firms did not require a more responsive
supply chain, as would be typical
in fast-moving consumer products (Fisher 1997).
Instead, an efficient supply chain focused on cost management may have been more
appropriate. This may have contributed to the non-significant findings. It is also very
possible that global sourcing issues may interact with these variables, due to the
complexity associated with cultural differences, communication difficulties, and time zone
differences (Handfield 1993). A further explanation may be the presence of a time-lag
inherent in the interaction of these variables. A strategic purchasing orientation may take
a number of years to enact substantial improvements in aligning supplier capabilities
(responsiveness) with the needs of the buyer firm. Longitudinal studies may help to shed
light on this issue.

6.2 Impact of supply management practices on buyer performance improvement

Two of the three hypothesised relationships were significant and in expected directions.
Supply management practices of integration and supply base responsiveness led to
improved buyer performance, while socialisation had no significant
impact on
performance. Supplier integration had the largest impact on relationship performance.
The results indicate that firms who build joint investments with suppliers are able to derive
greater benefits from the relationship. Such joint investment increases the level dependency


2662

B. Lawson et al.

between buyer and supplier, facilitating the alignment of organisational systems, sharing
of knowledge and learning and improved problem solving. These benefits may manifest
themselves in reduced time-to-market, improved design cycles, reduced costs and risk
sharing agreements.

In addition, as the supply base becomes more responsive (i.e. ability to change delivery,
volume, mix and customisation), greater performance improvements are gained. This is
likely due to the greater ability of the supplier to meet buyer firm’s needs, efficiently and
effectively. Our results do not, however, provide a good explanation for how the
responsive nature of
the supply base is developed. One method for improving
responsiveness is through supplier development. Further research could examine the
links between supply base characteristics, strategic purchasing and supplier development.
Sako (2004), for example, in her investigation of the automotive industry found that firms
were reformulating their governance structures to extend their firm boundaries with
suppliers to make joint investment decisions, share intellectual property and co-design
development.

Finally, socialisation mechanisms were not significantly associated with buyer
performance improvement. This is surprising given the strength of research indicating
that building knowledge-sharing routines (i.e. through socialisation mechanisms) are likely
to be key drivers of relational rents (Dyer and Singh 1998). It may be that although
socialisation does not have a direct effect, it is possible that it acts to improve the efficacy
of other supply management practices, such as process integration and as a conduit to
facilitate supplier responsiveness.

Given these significant results, investment in developing a firm’s supplier management
capabilities would appear to be a managerial priority. Our research shows that if firms are
to become more responsive to their market places they need to build a strategic
competence in their purchasing functions. Strategic purchasing leads to improved supplier
integration and socialisation mechanisms, giving overall
in buyer
performance. Having a supply chain that can react quickly, efficiently and effectively to
intense market pressures would appear key to maintaining a sustainable competitive
advantage.

7. Limitations and conclusions

No research is without its limitations, and there are some cautions in interpreting the
results of our study. First, this study was based on a sample of companies in the CIPS
database. Although a wide range of sectors were evident, the results may not be
generalisable to all companies. Replication across other industries, including services,
as well as international contexts would also increase our understanding of
the
pervasiveness of strategic purchasing. Informant bias can be an issue in self-reporting
surveys (Kumar et al. 1993). We attempted to minimise the presence of any such bias
through the selection of respondents with comparable roles, focusing on organisational
and sub-unit performance and avoiding questions of personal performance, as well as by
assuring total anonymity and confidentiality such that individual responses could not be
identified. In addition, the cross-sectional nature of our data means we are not able to test
causal inferences regarding the relationships between strategic purchasing, supply practices
and performance. Longitudinal data is
to assert causation.

Future research based on case studies could provide rich data and would be particularly
valuable in substantiating the evolving nature of strategic purchasing functions.

Our unit of analysis was also restricted to one-side of a dyadic tie between buyer and
supplier. Further research could examine the other side of the dyad, namely the supplier.
The use of other research methods, such as case studies, could also further expand the
focus, shedding light on the entire strategic supply network (Gulati et al. 2000). This study
has examined relationships between supply management practices and buyer performance.
Future research could investigate their impact on financial performance, or the
interactions with other internal functions. What other variables influence strategic
purchasing and relationship performance? Relationships between the supply management
capabilities examined may also exist, such as between socialisation and supplier
integration. These relationships were beyond the scope of this study, but would be
worthwhile of further investigation.

Although some research is starting to examine the factors influencing strategic
purchasing, few have focused on the impact on supply management practices and
relationship performance. The analysis presented in this study shows that strategic
purchasing has a positive impact on supply management practices and the returns from the
supplier relationship. The research indicates that firms can gain a collaborative advantage
and extract relational rents from building a distinctive capability in strategic purchasing.
The results suggest that significant value can be created ‘after the ink on the contract has
dried’ through improved supplier relationship management.
