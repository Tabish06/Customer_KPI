This study explores the possibility  that the effects of various work-related  antecedents on 
complaining behavior  are  transmitted  through  the  beliefs  that  employees  hold  about 
themselves.  Data  obtained  from  3 17 schoolteachers  and their  principals  provide  strong 
support  for the proposition  that organization-based  self-esteem (OBSE) is an  intervening 
mechanism between the antecedents of job satisfaction, affective commitment, procedural 
justice,  distributive  justice,  and  leader-member  exchange quality  and  workplace  com- 
plaining. The relationships that emerged were  fully mediated,  suggesting that OBSE is a 
central  feature  in how  employees think,  feel, and  interact  with  others  in  the  workplace. 
Avenues for future research and study limitations are discussed. 

Though some employees seldom seem to complain about workplace events, 
others rarely appear to be content. Evidence as far back as the Hawthorne studies 
has suggested that some employees, known then as chronic kickers, are perenni- 
ally displeased (Roethlisberger,  1941). Little seems to have changed in the inter- 
vening years.  Such employees, now labeled coniplainers, continue to be known 
as “squeaky wheels” and for making “mountains out of molehills.” By focusing 
on the negative, rather than on the positive side of workplace events, these 
employees are noted for causing dissension, destroying team spirit, and creating 
attitude problems.

WORKPLACE COMPLAINING  2263 

The popular press has long regarded workplace complaining (or simply 
griping or whining) to be an unavoidable part of the social calculus that neces- 
sarily develops within organizations and  among organization members (e.g., 
Schellhardt,  1996). At the individual level, to the extent that employees become 
known as complainers, they run the risk of being excluded from informal groups 
and other social interactions (Kowalski,  1996), as well as being placed in a 
leader’s out-group (Graen & Uhl-Bien,  1995). From an organizational perspec- 
tive, such employees also may undermine the interpersonal interactions necessary 
for effective performance. In this respect, research on emotional contagion (e.g., 
Barsade, 2002) has shown how the transfer of moods can directly and indirectly 
influence individual and workgroup cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors. Given 
its prevalence and potential detrimental effects,  it is surprising that workplace 
complaining has received scant attention in the organizational behavior literature. 
Drawing primarily on self-theory and existing research  on why people com- 
plain, we have developed a conceptual scheme in which self-esteem mediates the 
effects of various attitudinal and relational antecedents on workplace complain- 
ing. Self-theory  holds that one’s self-concept  is the frame of reference through 
which one views the world. Both empirical and experimental data confirm that 
self-appraisal can be a powerful influence on how one thinks, feels, and interacts 
with others (Cross, Morris, & Gore, 2002). Scholarly interest in the self has been 
an enduring focus of various allied disciplines (for a recent literature review, see 
Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs, 2003). Over the past 25 years, self- 
esteem has emerged as a central construct in organizational behavior. Tharenou’s 
(1 979) review of the employee self-esteem literature traces this emergence to 
various origins. 

Of relevance to our present interest is Tharenou’s (1979) lament that organi- 
zational researchers rarely have considered the mediational role of the self in 
initiating behavior. The limited attention devoted to self-esteem as a mediator in 
organizational studies contrasts with models that have been developed by 
learning, personality,  and developmental theorists,  as well as clinicians with a 
cognitive-behavioral orientation (Harter, 1999). These models emphasize that the 
self is more than a passive set of cognitive appraisals, but rather is an “active, 
interpretative structure that is continually involved in the regulation of on-going 
behavior” (Markus & Wurf,  1987, p. 328). As such, the self not only structures 
perceptions and regulates behaviors, but also guides decisions and actions (Leary, 
2002). 

Mediating Role of Self-Esteem 

The active, controlling aspect of the self has been dubbed the agent or execu- 
tive function (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, & Tice,  1998). The self’s 
capacity to mediate between individuals’ contacts with the social environment 


2264  HECK ET AL. 

and their willingness to engage in volitional action (including attempts to control 
the environment,  control the self, and make choices) has been  the focus of vari- 
ous theoretical perspectives dating back to at least the early work of Freud ( 1  923/ 
196 1). In the Freudian  scheme, an individual’s  social environment would have its 
effect on behavior through  its effect on one’s self-esteem. Freud argued, for 
example, that individuals  try to counter threats  to their self-esteem  by engaging 
in compensatory activities.  The mediating role of self-esteem  in linking the self 
and behavior has now  become an accepted part of self-theory (e.g.,  Symister & 
Friend, 2003). 

In  developing our thinking about workplace complaining, we hypothesized 
that various attitudinal and relational antecedents would be related to self-esteem, 
which in turn would be related  to complaining  behavior.  We  took as our point of 
departure the Freudian (1923/196 1) belief that the social environment shapes an 
individual’s self-esteem and that individuals try to cope with threats to their self- 
hood by engaging in compensatory activities.  In doing so, we suggest that indi- 
viduals  take on social  roles that communicate their  self-perceptions  (e.g., 
complainer) and use acts of communication (e.g., complaining) to shield their 
self-view. 

Our position, following self-theory, is that to the degree employees derive 
self-esteem from their workplace experiences,  self-esteem fimctions as a psycho- 
logical conduit through which workplace experiences influence complaining 
behavior  (Baumeister & Vohs, 2003). With this in mind, our goal is to examine 
the potential role of self-esteem  as a mediator  in the following conceptual 
scheme. 

Conceptual  Scheme Development 

Kowalski  ( 1996) proposed a theoretical framework outlining the functions, 
antecedents, and consequences of complaints and complaining. Within this 
framework, she conceptualized a complaint as being the expression of displea- 
sure for the purpose of venting one’s emotions, achieving personal goals, or both. 
Complaining is a behavioral manifestation  of this discontentment. 

In  this respect, researchers have identified  two distinct types of complaints. 
Instrumental complaints are expressed for the purpose of changing an undesir- 
able state of affairs. For example, a consumer who demands a refund  for a faulty 
product or who speaks to a supervisor  concerning a rude customer-service 
employee is expressing dissatisfaction and seeking redress by registering an 
instrumental complaint. A substantial portion of the consumer-satisfaction  litera- 
ture has addressed  this type of complaining.  Likewise,  research  in  labor- 
management relations concerning the nature of grievances and the grievance pro- 
cess also has focused primarily  on instrumental complaining. In contrast, our 
focus is on noninstrumental  complaints; that is, complaints that are meant to 


WORKPLACE COMPLAINING  2265 

serve a social expressive or goal-enhancing  function. Common noninstrumental 
complaints  include “This company doesn’t appreciate me,” or “My last raise was 
too long ago, and too small.” Such complaints are not generally instrumental  in 
bringing about change. 

Related to our present focus, Organ (1 990) proposed a theoretical connection 
between complaining and the sportsmanship dimension of organizational citizen- 
ship behavior by  suggesting that good sports (i.e., individuals high in sports- 
manship) do not tend to complain when  inconvenienced  by  others, whereas 
poor  sports (i.e., individuals  low in sportsmanship) are unwilling to tolerate the 
inevitable inconveniences and impositions of work without complaining. This 
distinction acknowledges variations in the prevalence of complaining across indi- 
viduals. Moreover, it intimates that, whereas at times complaining might be an 
appropriate (i.e., legitimate) expression of one’s displeasure, doing so too fre- 
quently can jeopardize interpersonal relationships and social interactions. 

A key aspect underlying  Kowalski’s  (1996) framework is a state of self- 
focused attention.  Self-focus  initiates an evaluative process wherein  individuals 
make judgments about circumstances  in their social environment.  When circum- 
stances are deemed sufficiently unfavorable,  the displeasure that is experienced 
finds voice in complaining behavior. 

Within  a workplace setting, displeasure may stem from discontentment or 
disaffection emanating from circumstances associated with work-related  atti- 
tudes and interpersonal relationships that are inconsistent with one’s self-esteem. 
Paralleling  the notion that the self serves an executive function  by actively 
initiating behavior, Kowlaski (1996) suggested that complaints are a means of 
controlling events in one’s social environment. As she noted, when individuals 
complain, “they are trying to regain control of a situation by putting an end to the 
experience of an aversive event” (p.  183). From Freudian and self-theory per- 
spectives, complaining thus may be seen as a compensatory  activity for counter- 
ing threats to one’s self-esteem. 

Similarly, in line with cognitive theory, complaining may be viewed as a 
means by which  individuals bring their influence to bear on events that  affect 
how they  live their lives (Leary, 2002). According  to the literature on organiza- 
tional citizenship, poor sports are individuals who tend to complain because they 
are unwilling “to sacrifice their personal interest for the good of the organization” 
(Podsakoff, MacKenzie,  Paine, & Bachrach, 2000, p. 5 17). 

Recognizing the etiological role attributed to the self in understanding com- 
plaining, our conceptual  scheme (presented in Figure  1) proposes that a domain- 
specific expression of self-esteem (i.e., organization-based  self-esteem) mediates 
the effects of attitudinal  (i.e., job satisfaction, organizational  commitment,  orga- 
nizational justice) and relational (i.e., leader-membership  exchange) antecedents 
on workplace complaining. That is, individuals do not respond to their work 
environment directly,  choosing instead to filter their emotional and behavioral 


2266  HECK ET AL. 

responses through their working self-concept (Lord  & Brown, 2004). Self-esteem 
is thought to be an important component of that self-concept. 

The notion that the self is a vital mediator that enables individuals to maintain 
and modify their behavior is an essential feature of established social psycholog- 
ical theories  involving attribution, cognitive dissonance,  and self-awareness 
(Shrauger & Schoeneman, 1979). The importance of self-esteem  in maintaining 
and modifying behavior is underscored by the conclusion that of the four traits 
(viz. neuroticism,  self-esteem, generalized self-efficacy, and locus of control) 
comprising core self-evaluation theory,  self-esteem “displays the highest  loading 
on the latent core self-evaluation  concept, suggesting that  of the four traits it is 
the best indictor of core self-evaluations”  (Bono & Judge, 2003, p. SS). In brief, 
numerous theories support the view that the self is the frame of reference through 
which individuals  interact with their world and, thus,  is a powerful  influence on 
how they negotiate the complexities of everyday life (Baumeister & Voh, 2003). 

Organization-Based  Self-Esteem 

Self-esteem as a trait is typically defined as one’s appraisal of one’s value as a 
human being. Global selfesteem represents an overall  value judgment about the 
self, whereas domain-specific self-esteem denotes one’s appraisal  of one’s value 
in a particular area (e.g.,  work, family,  social, athletic, or intellectual spheres; 
Leary & Baumeister, 2000). 

Pierce, Gardner, Cummings, and Dunham (1 989) observed that, within an 
organizational context, global self-esteem measures with their wide-ranging 
focus often fail to show anticipated relationships  with other constructs. Drawing 
on the work of Korman (1976), who viewed self-esteem at work  to be  domain 
specific, Pierce et al. introduced  the concept of organization-based  self-esteem 
(OBSE), defined  as one’s evaluation about one’s value and worthiness as an 
organization member.  In doing so, they reasoned that, if self-esteem were placed 
in a specific context, it would  be a better predictor of workplace outcomes than 
global measures commonly used  in the literature. A growing body  of evidence 
showing that measures which specify context yield higher criterion-related valid- 
ities and fewer error variances than generalized  measures supports this reasoning 
(Hough, 2003). 

Because we seek to explore antecedents of workplace complaining within a 
specific context and to do so as accurately  as possible, we likewise judge OBSE 
to be  more appropriate to our conceptual  scheme than global self-esteem. In 
doing so, we recognize that individuals cannot ascribe meaning to themselves  in 
a vacuum. Rather, as described by Super ( 1963), “the self is generally a picture of 
the self in some role, some situation, in  a position, performing some set of 
functions, or in some web of relationships” (p. 18). Consequently.  the beliefs 
employees form about themselves as role occupants have implications not only 


WORKPLACE COMPLAINING  2267 

for workplace complaining (as a behavioral manifestation of employee attitudinal 
discontent), but other more general behaviors reflecting disaffection. Moreover, 
our use of OBSE rather than a global self-esteem measure is also supported by 
research indicating that, given the multifarious nature of the self, individuals’ 
domain-specific self-conceptions (rather than their global self-conception) under- 
lie their reactions to self-relevant  stimuli (cf. Swann, Hixon, Stein-Seroussi, & 
Gilbert,  1990), as well as cognitive research indicating that one’s self-view is 
context dependent (Kuhnen & Oyserman, 2002). 

Our reasoning also fits with symbolic interactionists’ specification of the self 
as a reflection  of appraisals made by significant others (Yeung & Martin, 2003). 
According to interaction theory, based on the writings of Cooley (1 902) and 
Mead (1934), individuals infer self-views from their experiences with others and, 
in turn, this guides or influences their behavior. Although some hold that self- 
esteem is something personal that comes from within an individual (Tafarodi, 
Marshall, & Milne, 2003), the interactionist perspective contends that self- 
knowledge develops out of social experience and is a reflected appraisal  of how 
one is appraised by significant others, specified by Cooley as the “reflected  or 
looking-glass self‘ (p. 152) and by Mead as the “self as social object” (p. 277). In 
this sense, OBSE with its emphasis on signals received from the attitudes and 
behaviors of one’s supervisors is an interactionist conception and not an internal- 
ized self-esteem construct. 

Workplace Complaining 

Although our work is indebted to previous research, it is the first, to our 
knowledge, to explore the possibility that the effects of work-related antecedents 
on complaining behavior are transmitted through the beliefs that employees hold 
about themselves. At best, some dispositional correlates of complaints about 
supervisory requests and job satisfaction have been reported (Ekpo-Ufot,  1979; 
Sachau, Houlihan, & Gilbertson,  1999). With this in mind, we believe that con- 
ceptual clarification is needed to better differentiate complaining from how 
sportsmanship typically is viewed. 

As defined  in the organizational  citizenship behavior (OCB) literature, 
sportsmanship is “the willingness of an  employee to tolerate less than ideal 
circumstances without complaining-to 
‘avoid complaining, petty grievances, 
railing  against real or imagined slights, and making federal cases out of small 
potatoes”’ (Podsakoff, MacKenzie,  & Hui 1983, p. 7).  The items developed by 
Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, and Fetter (1990) to gauge this dimension 
(described in the following section) are consistent with this definition. This label, 
however, does not correspond with the standard definition of sportsmanship as 
“the quality of showing fairness, respect and generosity towards [an] opposing 
team or player” (cf. Cambridge Dicfionaty of American English, 2002). 


2268  HECK ET AL. 

Coleman and Borman (2000) and LePine, Erez, and Johnson (2002) noted the 
lack of structure in describing OCB and suggested  that inadequate attention has 
been devoted to defining its dimensions.  We agree and underscore that the label 
sportsmanship is inconsistent  within the broader context of the meaning of this 
term. Recognizing  this labeling dilemma, we carefully  reviewed the OCB litera- 
ture only to find that as reported  in Podsakoff et al.’s (2000) recent review, satis- 
faction  is the only variable  included in the present study that has been 
investigated previously as an antecedent of what we argue is more appropriately 
labeled complaining. Acknowledging the difficulty of interpreting empirical 
findings related to these cognate concepts and to convey more clearly our central 
focus and results, we thus restrict ourselves to the use of the descriptive term 
workplace complaining. 

Attitudinal Antecedents 

Job Satisfaction 

Job sutisfaction  is commonly defined as a general attitude reflecting one’s 
overall global  feeling about one’s job (Spector,  1997). It also has been  con- 
ceptualized as an individual’s appraisal of the degree to which the various  facets 
of a work environment fulfill one’s  needs (Dawis & Lofquist,  1984). Studies 
reporting a positive relationship between job satisfaction and OBSE are common 
(Pierce  & Gardner, 2004). This relationship  is in keeping with  the view of 
theorists such as Coopersmith (1967), who proposed  that self-esteem arises 
from aspects of one’s life that are experienced as satisfactory.  In  the context of 
the proposed conceptual scheme, there is evidence to suggest that satisfaction 
with the basic characteristics of one’s job influences one’s  self-esteem  (Lee, 
2003). 

At the same time, Lehman and Simpson (1 992) reported finding that work- 
defined to include work-related  behaviors such as 
place complainirig-broadly 
filing formal complaints, spreading rumors or gossip about coworkers, and 
reporting  others for wrongdoing-is 
negatively  associated  with job satisfaction. 
Given the role attributed  to job satisfaction  as a source of one’s attitude toward 
the self, the possibility  is raised that the actual relationship between job satisfac- 
tion and workplace complaining  may be mediated through OBSE. 

ASfective Commitment 

AfSective commitment  is defined as an individual’s emotional attachment 
to, identification with, and involvement  in an employing organization, character- 
ized by a strong belief in and an acceptance of its goals, a willingness to exert 
considerable effort on the organization’s  behalf, and a strong desire to maintain 


WORKPLACE COMPLAINING  2269 

membership in the organization  (Mowday, Porter, & Steers,  1982). Employees 
with strong, positive affective commitment remain with an organization because 
they want to, rather than because they feel they ought to or because they need to 
(Meyer, Allen, & Smith, 1993). 

Committed employees identify with, are involved in, and enjoy their work- 
place membership, Moreover, they tend to develop a strong workplace bond and 
to internalize work-related problems as their own, showing a willingness to go 
the extra distance (Meyer, Stanley, Herscovitch, & Topolnytsky, 2002). As 
Luchak (2003) reasoned, given their close emotional ties, affectively committed 
employees have a strong desire to see their organizations succeed and, rather than 
suffer in silence, will engage in efforts to bring about change, using not only 
established two-way  communication channels (e.g., petitioning directly to a 
supervisor), but also more flexible modes of communication (e.g.,  griping to a 
team member or coworker). 

This reasoning implies a direct relationship between  affective commitment 
and complaining behavior. As noted by Gecas (2000), however, to the extent that 
positive commitment represents an individual’s identification with an organiza- 
tion  and its goals, it also supports an individual’s  self. This suggests that the 
effects of affective commitment are indirect, working through the self‘s motiva- 
tional system. Such reasoning is consistent with the general view that the forma- 
tion of satisfactory workplace bonds is related positively to self-esteem (Leary & 
Baumeister, 2000), as well as both Steele’s (1988) psychological theory, which 
emphasizes motivational processes that affirm valued aspects of one’s  self- 
identity, and Murray and colleagues’ (Murray, Griffin, Rose, & Bellavia, 2003) 
recent emphasis on the interpersonal or relational origins of self-esteem. Each of 
these views of the self gives priority to emotional relations and social connected- 
ness, holding that one’s self-esteem is influenced and shaped by one’s feelings as 
derived from the social context in which they interact. To the degree that the self 
arises from one’s emotional attachment to, identification with, and involvement 
in an employing organization, and that individuals act (i.e., engage in com- 
plaining behavior) to protect their self-views, it is possible that the influence of 
affective commitment on workplace complaining may be through its mediational 
relationship with self-esteem. 

Organizational Justice 

It is generally held that perceived unfairness related to either distributive or 
procedural justice within  an employment relationship is associated with 
employee alienation and, by extension, an increased likelihood of workplace 
difficulties (Viswesvaran & Ones, 2002). Distributive justice focuses on the 
perceived fairness of outcomes received from work-related decision procedures 
(e.g., raises, promotions, evaluations). In contrast, procedural justice focuses on 


2270  HECK ET AL. 

judgments about the process or means by which such decisions are rendered. 
Employees tend to be more accepting of decisions based on procedures that are 
perceived as just. Whereas procedural justice and distributive justice are distinct 
concepts, they are related because individuals who perceive a lack of distributive 
justice tend to question the fairness of procedural decisions (Lease, 1998). 

To the extent that the self-devaluating implications of perceived  unfairness 
engender employee alienation and threaten employees’ self-worth, we reason 
that employees will  be more likely to complain. Our reasoning draws on Lind 
and Tyler’s (1 988) group-value model, which suggests that procedural justice is 
important to individuals because it implies that they are valued members of their 
groups. In turn, by providing individuals with positive information  about their 
worth as group members, fair treatment enhances their self-esteem (Cohen- 
Charash & Spector, 2001). 

Building on Crocker, Luhtanen, Cooper, and Bouvrette’s  (2003) efforts to 
identify the domains on which individuals stake their self-worth, this latter find- 
ing would seem to be especially germane to workplace settings where individ- 
uals’ self-esteem is likely to be  influenced by the degree to which they attain 
specific outcomes based on assessments of procedural-  and distributive-justice 
judgments. Consistent with this logic, Niehoff and Moorman (1993) reported that 
employees who feel unfairly treated  in work-related procedures  are more likely 
to complain, and Chattopadhyay  (1999) reported finding a positive relationship 
between perceived workplace justice and OBSE. 

These findings raise the possibility that the actual relationship between justice 
perceptions and workplace complaining may be mediated through OBSE. Lord 
and Brown (2004) similarly proposed that individuals’ reactions and responses to 
workplace injustice are filtered through their working self-concept, which is 
comprised of OBSE and other aspects of identity. 

Relational Antecedent: Leader-Member  Exchange 

Leader-member  exchange (LMX) theory suggests that supervisors develop 
unique, interpersonal relationships with each subordinate (Gerstner & Day, 
1997). This suggestion rests on the belief that in social exchanges, individuals 
must offer something others see as valuable. Thus, in a high-quality superior- 
subordinate relationship, a subordinate feels obligated to engage in  behaviors 
that  benefit  a supervisor (i.e.,  leader),  and the supervisor reciprocates. In this 
connection, Korman (1 976) and others have posited that an individual’s self- 
esteem is a function of the extent to which psychologically significant others 
(e.g., one’s supervisor) exhibit through their behaviors that one is a valued orga- 
nization member. Likewise, George and Brief (1 996) contended that the self as a 
valued employee is one of the many possible selves in need of motivational 
attention. 


WORKPLACE  COMPLAINING  2271 

Of importance to our interests is research indicating that subordinates who 
experience a low-quality relationship with their supervisors complain more about 
unfair managerial treatment than do their workplace counterparts (Sias, 1996). 
This finding supports Leary’s (1 999) conception of self-esteem as a “psychologi- 
cal meter, or gauge, that monitors the quality of people’s relationships  with 
others” (p. 33), and reflects their general sense o f  being the sort of person who is 
valued and accepted by psychologically  significant others. 

Combining these findings with self-theory,  to the extent that the reciprocal 
behaviors of an employee’s supervisor signal that the employee is a valued  orga- 
nization member, the employee should feel more accepted and should be less 
likely to complain. This reasoning is consistent with Andersen and Chen’s (2002) 
concept of the relational self; which holds that knowledge about the self is linked 
with knowledge about significant others; Epstein’s ( 1973) notion that one’s self- 
concept develops out of experience, especially during interactions  with signifi- 
cant others; and the general view that signals o f  approval from significant others 
play a major role in enhancing self-esteem (Harter,  1999). Taken together, theory 
and research thus suggest the possibility that the effects of LMX on complaining 
behavior are transmitted through OBSE. 

Participants and Data Collection 

Method 

Our initial target sample consisted of 471 schoolteachers and their immediate 
supervisors (i.e., principals), representing 25 elementary, middle, and high 
schools located within  one school district in the southeastern United States. Sys- 
tematic sampling was employed to establish a predefined domain wherein we 
selected every fourth teacher from an alphabetized list of all teachers at each 
school. It was deemed necessary to select a subset of teachers  from each school 
to reduce the burden placed  on principals  who were asked to rate the workplace 
complaining of each teacher included in the study. 

Interaction among coworkers and between respondents  and their supervisors 
is a necessary presumption for testing  our hypotheses.  With respect to our focal 
sample, there existed ample opportunity  for teacher-coworker  and teacher- 
principal  interactions during classroom  observations,  lunch hours, class breaks, 
weekly committee meetings, and monthly faculty meetings attended by prin- 
cipals. The sample was thus considered to be appropriate for examining the 
proposed hypotheses. 

Because of the number of schools and the teachers’ varied  schedules, data 
were collected via surveys distributed through a central-ofice mail system. As an 
incentive to participate, the names of all teachers and principals  returning com- 
pleted surveys were entered in a random drawing to receive one of three $100 


2272  HECK ET AL. 

money orders. Of the 25 principals, 22 (88%) returned 449 surveys. The response 
rate for teachers was 67% (n = 3 17). Of this total,  18% were male and 82% were 
female, with 94.6% being Caucasian and 4.2% being African  American. The 
teachers’  average age was 40 years (SD = 10.35). Their average tenure with the 
school district was 12 years (SD = 9.62), average tenure with current school was 9 
years (SD = 8.91), and average tenure in current position was 7 years (SD = 8.30). 
Responses to all survey measures were summed and coded such that a high 
score indicates a high level of agreement. All 449 principal survey responses 
were used in establishing the measurement properties of the workplace complain- 
ing construct. Painvise deletion of data for zero-order correlations on the mediat- 
ing and explanatory  variables of interest yielded sample sizes ranging from 302 
to 3 12. 

Predictor Variables 

Job satisfaction. Job satisfaction (a = 20) was self-assessed using Chalykoff 
and Kochan’s  (1 989) six-item  measure, which gauges the extent of satisfaction 
toward one’s job, pay, benefits, promotion opportunities,  recognition received for 
a job well done, and amount of say individuals have in how their work is done. 
Unless otherwise indicated, responses for all measures were rated  on a 5-point 
scale ranging from  I  (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongZv agree). 

In selecting a facet rather than  a global measure of job satisfaction,  we were 
influenced  by the work of Schimel, Arndt, Pyszczynski,  and Greenberg (2001). 
This work  suggests, “beyond  the simple evaluative valence of one’s  self- 
evaluation, the nature of the sources from which one’s self-worth  is derived is a 
critical determinant of how self-esteem affects ongoing psychological  processes” 
(p. 35). Accordingly, we use a facet measure (as opposed to an overall or global 
assessment) of satisfaction so as to reflect the heterogeneous nature of the various 
dimensions that comprise this construct’s content domain. 

Ajfective commitment. Affective commitment (a = 20) was self-assessed by a 
six-item measure developed by Meyer and Allen (1991). Sample items include “I 
would be very happy to spend the rest of my career with this organization”; 
‘‘I 
really  feel as if this organization’s  problems are my own”;  and “I  do not feel a 
strong sense of ‘belonging’ to my organization” (reverse scored). 

Procedural justice. The perceived  fairness of procedures used  in making 
workplace decisions was self-assessed using Naumann  and Bennett’s (2000) 
nine-item measure (a = 38). The measure began with ‘‘In this organization  , . .,” 
which was followed by items such as  “.  . . consistent rules and procedures are 
used to make decisions about things that affect me”;  “.  . . decisions that affect 
me are made ethically”; and “. . . my input is obtained prior to making decisions.” 
Disfribzrtivejustice. The perceived fairness of outcomes resulting from work- 
place decisions (e.g.,  pay, promotion, evaluation) was self-assessed  using Price

and Mueller’s (1986) six-item measure (a = .94). The stem “I  am fairlj rewarded 
. . .” was followed by items such as “. . . considering the responsibilities I  have”; 
“. . . taking into account the amount of education and training that I have had”; 
and “. . . in view of the amount of experience that I have.” 

Leader-member exchange. Teachers’ perceptions of the quality of their rela- 
tionship with their  supervisors  (i.e., principals)  were self-assessed  using 
Scandura and Graen’s (1984) seven-item LMX measure (a = .90). Sample items 
include “My supervisor understands my problems and needs”;  “My supervisor 
would  ‘bail me out’ at hidher expense”; and “I have an effective working rela- 
tionship with my supervisor.” 

Mediating Variable: OBSE 

OBSE (a = .87) was self-assessed using a  10-item measure developed by 
Pierce et al. (1989). Respondents were asked to think about the extent to which 
they agreed or disagreed with each of 10 statements intended to tap the degree to 
which they saw themselves as capable, significant, successful, and worthwhile 
within their employing organization. Sample items include “1  count around 
here”; ‘‘I  am taken seriously around my school”; “I am an important part of this 
place”; and “I can make a difference around my school.” 

Criterion Variab/e: Workplace Complaining 

Principals were asked to assess the degree to which teachers complained 
using the following five items adapted from Podsakoff et al. (1990): “This 
teacher consumes a lot of time complaining about trivial matters”; “This teacher 
always focuses on what’s wrong, rather than the positive side”; “This teacher 
tends to make mountains out of molehills”;  “This teacher always finds fault with 
what the organization is doing”; and “This teacher is the classic ‘squeaky wheel’ 
that always needs greasing.” 

Assessments were returned to the researchers under separate cover and 
matched to teacher surveys. We chose to use this measure (a = .96) because it not 
only captures the nature of complaining as conceptualized by Kowalski’s (I 996) 
framework, but also reflects the essence of workplace complaining that we 
sought to tap. An independent-sample t test confirmed that there were no system- 
atic differences between respondents  and nonrespondents  on principals’ assess- 
ment of complaining. 

Controls 

Because self-report data are susceptible to contamination caused by common 
source variance  (i.e., percept-percept  bias), affective feelings, and pressure  for 


2274  HECK ET AL. 

positive self-presentation,  we took precautions  to control for response biases.  To 
minimize biased relations among study variables as a result of common source 
bias, we used multiple sources to collect our data (i.e., principals  and teachers). 
Teachers completed  the attitudinal  and relational  measures, and principals  com- 
pleted the complaining measure. 

To control  for the possibility  that teacher responses, especially in relation to 
self-esteem, might be confounded by individual  differences in emotionality, as 
advised  by Watson,  Suls, and Haig (2002), negative affectivity  was entered as a 
covariate in our statistical analyses. Prior studies have shown that individuals 
high in negative affectivity are more likely to have a downbeat view of the world 
and to dwell on their failures and shortcomings. Consequently, they are less satis- 
fied with their lives and have a less favorable self-view (Watson & Slack, 1993). 
As these differences are stable over time and across contexts, we chose to 
treat negative affectivity  as a trait, rather than as a state factor, and entered it in 
our analyses as a control variable rather than  an antecedent of workplace com- 
plaining.  Trait negative  affectivity  (a = .86) was self-assessed  by  11 items from 
the Multidimensional Personality Index (Watson & Tellegen,  1985). Sample 
items include “I  often find myself worrying  about Something”; “My feelings are 
hurt rather easily”; and “Often I get irritated at little annoyances.” 

Finally, to control  for the tendency of individuals  to present themselves in a 
favorable light relative to social norms and standards, social desirability also was 
entered as a covariate. Social desirability was self-assessed using a short form of 
the Marlowe-Crowne  measure (a = .70; Ballard,  1992). This measure consists of 
13 true-false  items and has been the preferred measure of the vast majority of 
researchers  conducting organizational  behavior  studies (Moorman & Podsakoff, 
1992). Items were scored with  1  indicating  true and 0 indicatingfalse,  with 
reverse scoring resulting  in  a possible range in  scores from 0 to  13 when all 
responses  are summed. Sample items include “On a few occasions,  I have given 
up doing something because I thought too little of my ability”;  “There have been 
times when  I  felt like rebelling against people in authority even though 1 knew 
they were right”; and “No matter who I’m talking to, I’m always a good listener.” 

Results 

Descriptive  statistics, internal consistency reliability  estimates, and intercor- 
relations  for all study variables are reported  in Table  1. The correlations among 
variables correspond closely to those reported in the literature and display the 
conditions necessary to test for mediation as proposed by our conceptual scheme. 
To wit, each of the focal antecedent variables was related  significantly  to work- 
place complaining; each antecedent variable  was related  significantly  to OBSE; 
and, finally, OBSE was related significantly to workplace complaining (Baron & 
Kenny,  1986).

The absolute correlation of study variables with socially desirable responding 
averaged .16, with a range from  -.03 to .23; and with  negative affectivity aver- 
aged .12, with a range of -.22 to .18. This indicates the absence of a general 
response set associated with either control variable. 

To confirm the value of using all six predictor variables in our analyses,  we 
first examined the strength of their linear relationships. Tolerance statistics for 
the predictors  placed  in a complete equation with workplace complaining as the 
outcome variable and social desirability  and negative  affect as covariates ranged 
from 0.45 for affective commitment to 0.27 for LMX ( M  = 0.38, SD = 0.07), 
indicating that multicollenarity  among the predictors was not a concern (NoruSis, 
1997). 

As indicated in Figure  1, we expected that the designated attitudinal and rela- 
tional antecedents would influence workplace complaining through  their impact 
on OBSE. This expectation was tested  using structural  equation  modeling; spe- 
cifically, by means of the recommended  approach  for testing nested  models 
(Anderson & Gerbing,  1988). Two competing models were tested: a fully medi- 
ated model and a partially mediated model. 

For the fully mediated model (Figure  I),  we specified paths from all anteced- 
ents to OBSE, and  from OBSE to a latent construct of principal-rated  workplace 
complaining. The partially mediated model  also specified direct paths from all 
antecedents to the latent complaining construct. Significant direct paths  would 
suggest that other mechanisms beyond OBSE are needed to explain the effects of 
the antecedents on workplace complaining. The models were compared  directly 
using a sequential chi-square difference test based on each model’s respective 
chi-square goodness-of-fit estimate and corresponding degrees of freedom. 

We controlled  for the effects of negative  affectivity and social desirability by 
including them as exogenous variables with  paths freely estimated to all ante- 
cedents, the mediator, and the workplace complaining outcome construct (cf. 
Eisenberger,  Armeli, Rexwinkel, Lynch, & Rhoades, 2002). Following the rec- 
ommendations of Ping (2002), we used  a mixed latent and manifest model to 
improve the ratio of our sample size to the size of our input matrix and, thus, the 
accuracy of our competing model estimates. 

The antecedents and the mediator (all teacher-rated)  were specified as single- 
indicator manifest variables based on the mean  for each variable. Workplace 
complaining was specified as a latent construct using  five principal-rated  items 
for the measure  (Method section). The measurement  properties  of the complain- 
ing construct were estimated by means of composite reliability and variance 
extracted  (Fornell  & Larcker,  1981). These estimates are based on the standard- 
ized  loadings for the construct and variance as a result of random  measurement 
error (cf. Netermeyer,  Johnston,  & Burton,  1990). Composite reliability (similar 
to internal consistency) was estimated to be  .96 and variance extracted (amount 
of construct variance in relation  to variance as a result of random  measurement

error) was estimated to be .81. Both estimates suggest that the latent complaining 
construct had favorable psychometric  properties. 

The fully mediated model, ~ ~ ( 3 7 ,  N = 293) = 6 8 . 9 2 , ~  < .01 (root mean square 
error of approximation [RMSEA] = .054; goodness-of-fit  index [GFI] = .968; 
adjusted GFI [AGFI] = .922; comparative fit index  [CFI] = .989), fit the data as 
well as the less parsimonious partially  mediated model, according to the chi- 
square difference test, x2di%,(7, N  = 293) = l l  .04, p  > .lo. These results  suggest 
that the fully mediated model is the preferred model  in that it fit the data as well 
as a competing model (i.e., partially mediated) that included additional estimated 
parameters. 

An examination  of the standardized  parameter estimates (Figure 1) indicates 
significant positive paths from affective commitment, procedural justice,  and 
LMX to OBSE, suggesting that workplace experiences directly impact the beliefs 
that employees hold about themselves.  The parameter  estimates for job satisfac- 
tion and distributive justice were not statistically significant. As expected, OBSE 
was significantly and negatively related  to workplace complaining, suggesting 
that teachers with positive feelings about their value and worthiness  as organiza- 
tion members were viewed by their respective principals as being less likely to 
engage in complaining behavior. Consistent with the results of the chi-square dif- 
ference test between models, there were no significant direct paths from any of 
the model antecedents to workplace complaining. 

Discussion 

OBSE was found to completely  mediate the hypothesized  relationships 
between affective commitment,  procedural justice, and LMX quality with work- 
place complaining. Tests of a partial mediation  model  show that this conceptual 
alternative was not a good fitting model, as there were no significant direct paths 
from any of the antecedents we examined to workplace complaining. Further- 
more, tests of relative model fit indicate that the more parsimonious  fully medi- 
ated model fit the data as well as did the less parsimonious partially mediated 
model.  Therefore,  our findings support the notion  that OBSE fully mediates the 
relationships  between affective commitment, procedural justice, and LMX qual- 
ity and workplace complaining. Put somewhat differently, our results suggest that 
OBSE is a psychological conduit through which workplace experiences influence 
complaining behavior.  Whereas it has long been postulated that a relationship 
exists between one’s work role and associated job behaviors and attitudes. our 
findings underscore the importance of OBSE as an active agent in the subjective 
workplace experience. 

We did not find a reliable relationship between job satisfaction and OBSE 
once the effects of the other antecedents were considered. This suggests that 
the  self-esteem of the teachers in  our study operated  independently  of their 


WORKPLACE COMPLAINING  2279 

satisfaction levels; at least as reflected by the signals they received from the atti- 
tudes and behaviors of their supervisors. Our null finding relating to distributive 
justice and OBSE likewise suggests that perceived fairness of outcomes resulting 
from workplace decisions (e.g., pay, promotion, evaluation) is not associated 
with employees’ judgments of self-worth. Perhaps the standardized nature of the 
reward  structures and evaluation processes operative in a public school setting 
are so impersonal  as to have had no impact on the self-esteem of the teachers in 
our study. 

The consistency of our findings across the paths for affective commitment 
( b  = .33), procedural justice ( b  = .24), and LMX quality (b = .29) with OBSE 
suggests the value of managerial efforts aimed at enacting fair procedures, 
engendering affective commitment, and improving leader-member  relations as 
means of strengthening employees’ sense of being valuable and worthy organiza- 
tion  members.  Moreover,  being cognitively based,  we would expect OBSE 
motives to activate emotional responses (e.g., workplace complaining) in other 
matters  involving self-esteem.  For this reason, efforts should be made to ensure 
that work experiences lead to emotional  outcomes that help employees maintain 
a sense of psychological coherence and personal control over their social envi- 
ronment. 

Actions in this regard might be as simple as managers attending to employ- 
ees’ self-esteem as part of daily workplace interactions. This could be done in 
any number of ways, including  enhancing employees’  perceptions  of empower- 
ment and fair treatment through efforts such as employee involvement programs 
and formal grievance policies, reaffirming  their workplace worth through praise 
and constructive criticism, designing jobs so that they provide for increased 
responsibility  and significance,  and initiating training programs that allow them 
to develop their abilities. Conversely, every attempt should be made to avoid 
work experiences that lead to emotional outcomes that threaten employees’ sense 
of self-integrity. As self-theory holds, and as our results suggest, one’s self- 
esteem provides a frame of reference through which one views one’s world  and, 
thus, can be a powerful influence on one’s thoughts, feelings, and actions. 

In our tests for mediation,  paths representing  the direct effects on workplace 
complaining of the attitudinal  and relational  variables we studied were found to 
be nonsignificant.  This suggests that mediational linkages incorporating self- 
esteem are relatively robust and that the mediating  effect of self-esteem  may be 
an important resource  in reducing the magnitude of workplace alienation on psy- 
chological well-being. 

On a general level, our results indicate that OBSE plays a critical role in guid- 
ing and regulating workplace behavior and may provide valuable insights into 
how the effects of workplace experiences are produced. On a more immediate 
level, our results suggest that the study of how workplace experiences affect 
complaining behavior  offers value  for improving our understanding  of the 


2280  HECK ET AL. 

intervening pathways between  such experiences and psychological adjustment. 
Further investigation  of these pathways will provide  information about how and 
under what circumstances OBSE may either attenuate or exacerbate the dynam- 
ics of work-related experiences. 

From an applied perspective, our results carry an additional message for prac- 
ticing managers. Employees increasingly  have become recognized  as an invalu- 
able source of ideas for doing things better,  especially  in organizations 
undergoing turmoil associated with change. In such situations, it may be tempting 
to label those who express counter opinions (i.e., complain) as trozihlemakevs. 
Indeed, combined with the fear of retaliation, this likely explains the reluctance of 
many employees to share ideas for needed changes (Premeaux & Bedeian, 2003). 
We  suggest, however, that there may be a measure of wisdom in first asking if 
such employees are actually troublejnders, rather than troublemakers. 

Beyond potentially being a source of ideas for improvement,  our results sug- 
gest that by influencing employees’  affective commitment,  perceived procedural 
justice, and the quality of leader-member  relations, this alternative  strategy will 
encourage open dialogue by directly affecting employees’ self-esteem. Even 
more broadly considered, research shows that silence can exact not only a high 
psychological premium  from employees, but give rise to a culture that shuts 
down creativity and undermines  productivity.  Understandably, specific interven- 
tions for changing such cultures have become the focus of mounting attention 
(Perlow & Williams, 2003). 

Our findings suggest several avenues for future research. First, the prelimi- 
nary conceptual scheme we employed should be extended to include a more com- 
plete representation of potential antecedents,  as well as other relevant constructs. 
For example, it might be useful to include a wide range of situational factors, 
such as organizational structure and workgroup dynamics that might influence 
OBSE and, ultimately, reduce workplace complaining.  Future research also could 
assist in disentangling the interrelationships of the antecedents included in this 
study. Further,  Kowalski (1 996) has suggested that because complaining may 
lead others to form a negative impression of those who complain, individuals 
who are dispositionally attuned to the impressions that others are forming of 
them may be less likely to complain than individuals who are not as sensitive to 
self-presentational  concerns. Thus, a third avenue of future research would be to 
examine the potential  influence of self-nzonitoring, which refers to the observa- 
tion and control of expressive and self-presentational behaviors (Gangestad & 
Snyder, 2000), on complaining behavior. 

Another area for future research  would be to explore the dynamics of com- 
plaining contagion. According to Kowalski and Erickson (1997), chronic com- 
plaining is often contagious, exhibiting a domino effect that is initiated  by  a 
single person. They suggested that hearing  another’s complaints  makes listeners 
more aware of their own negative feelings, thereby triggering negative affect and 


WORKPLACE COMPLAINING  2281 

a desire to complain. Further,  hearing another’s complaints creates a cognitive 
burden  in listeners that may be alleviated by complaining  to others. Listening to 
others’ complaints also may remind listeners of events they have experienced and 
consequently  instill a need to relate those negative experiences. Therefore, to the 
extent that mood transfer occurs between workgroup members and, in turn, 
influences group dynamics and outcomes (e.g., cooperation, conflict, task perfor- 
mance; Neumann & Strack, 2000), future researchers may wish to examine the 
nature of workplace complaining contagion over time and the kinds of inter- 
ventions that might help to impede negative emotional contagion instigated  by 
complainers. 

In a similar cast, an organizational climate is a set of shared perceptions of 
policies, practices, and procedures that are rewarded, supported, and expected 
through group interaction (Schneider,  1990). Future researchers may wish to 
investigate whether a climate for complaining exists within some groups or entire 
organizations, wherein employees feel comfortable complaining  and do not con- 
sider it to be an aversive behavior. For example, it is plausible that complaining is 
supported in some settings where individuals  listen to each another and, by 
commiserating, encourage a complaining climate. In such circumstances, com- 
plaining may be a somewhat perverse form of job enrichment. 

As with all studies, a word of caution regarding our results is in order. First, it 
is important to stress that the use of school principals’  perceptions  to assess our 
criterion  variable presents complaining not simply as a behavior,  but as a com- 
plex phenomenon  related to the subjective evaluation and categorization of indi- 
viduals. The role of perceptions  in determining individuals’ judgments, however, 
is a cornerstone of the symbolic interactionist tradition, which holds that one’s 
interpretation  of an item or event is not based directly on the characteristics of 
objective stimuli, but rather on one’s conception of social reality (Younts & 
Mueller, 200 1).  Nonetheless, the veridicality of the principals’ assessments of the 
teachers’ complaining behavior and whether that behavior actually comprised 
complaining, according to some reasonable  standard, remains an empirical ques- 
tion. Hence,  future research would benefit by varying the source of complaining 
ratings. 

For instance,  an individual’s coworkers could rate complaining,  as peers are 
likely to have unique opportunities to observe one another’s complaining behav- 
ior. Indeed, prior research has shown that because coworkers have closer and 
more frequent  contact with one another, the information  they possess about one 
another may be more accurate than that of any other source (Barclay & Harland, 
1995). In this regard, one might speculate to the extent that teachers complain 
about their principals,  coworkers would be more aware of such complaints than 
would the principals  themselves. Principals  may catch some of this, but not the 
full extent. Thus, our findings actually may understate the extent to which our 
responding teachers engaged in workplace complaining.

Second, given that the data we used to test our conceptual  scheme are cross- 
sectional, rather than being grounded in a carefully controlled experiment, our 
results cannot be interpreted to indicate causality. Whereas the presence of causal 
relations among variables is implied by the use of the terms impact and effect, it 
was only possible  (given  our study design) to test the extent to which  the 
observed associations among the focal variables could be predicted from the 
hypothesized  conceptual  scheme (Figure  1 ), without  respect  to causation. 
Whereas the reported results are consistent with our proposed model, the arrows 
in Figure  1 may operate in the reverse direction, or the hypothesized  effects may 
be bidirectional. 

Additional evidence based on other types of research designs is needed before 
confident  attributions  of causality are warranted.  Although alternative orderings 
of paths cannot be ruled out, prior theory and empirical findings nonetheless sug- 
gest that the hypothesized ordering of the variables is justified. 

Third, our analyses are based on a single population (viz. teachers). Future 
research should be undertaken  with other populations  to corroborate the general- 
izability  of our sample. It is possible that the antecedents of OBSE are at least 
somewhat job specific. For instance,  in some professions,  an individual’s  OBSE 
may develop based on the evaluations of professional peers who may belong to 
the same professional  societies, but who do not share organizational  affiliations. 
In such cases, supervisors may play a minimal role in affecting one’s OBSE. 

In an academic setting, for example, an individual may garner a sense of self- 
esteem based on peer-reviewed  research and reputation within the academy. 
Similar dynamics may exist in professional-service firms that are common in 
law, accounting, consulting, and other fields.  Future research  may benefit  from 
incorporating job type as a focal variable to ascertain whether a general model is 
even possible. 

Finally, subsequent studies examining workplace complaining may do well to 
consider other antecedents of OBSE, as well as other potentially confounding dis- 
positional variables that may influence emotionality. In reality,  even if it were 
possible to identify and measure all relevant variables,  because of constraints on 
respondents’  time and energy no study can examine every putative cause and 
effect. Rather, researchers must proceed with the data that are available, recogniz- 
ing that few models are self-contained and thereby encouraging future researchers 
to investigate alternative models (Bouchard, Arvey, Keller, & Segal,  1992). 

The purpose  of our study was to evaluate empirically the general  hypothesis 
that an individual’s self-esteem mediates the impact of attitudinal  and relational 
variables  on workplace complaining.  In  doing so, we have responded  to 
Tharenou’s  ( 1979) lament that organizational  researchers  rarely have considered 
esteem as a mediator, a condition that  largely continues today, and have endeav- 
ored to move beyond  simple self-enhancement  explanations  for how individuals 
define themselves.  To our knowledge,  we are the first researchers to explore the 


WORKPLACE COMPLAINING  2283 

possibility that the effects of work-related antecedents on complaining behavior 
are transmitted through the beliefs that employees hold about themselves. 

We were unable to find any examples of experimental or survey research that 
has tested directly the mediating role of OBSE, as we proposed in this study. We 
do not suggest, however, that the antecedents we investigated are the only pre- 
cursors of workplace complaining or that they are better predictors than are other 
constructs (e.g., supervisor trust and respect). We also acknowledge that multiple 
motives beyond an affinity for feeling good about oneself may  influence com- 
plaining behavior. Likewise, we do not suggest that organization-based self- 
esteem is the best or only mediating factor intervening between the antecedents 
we examined in this study and workplace complaining. We do suggest-and  we 
believe that our findings indicate-that 
the constructs we examined have poten- 
tial to increase our understanding of workplace complaining.
