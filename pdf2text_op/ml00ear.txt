ABSTRACT

The objective of this paper is to analyse the environmental reporting practices
found in the annual reports published by companies operating in Spain, as well as
to determine the evolution of these practices during the period 1992 4, on the basis
of stakeholder theory.

In order to carry out this analysis, we have examined the annual reports of
seventy large companies operating in industries considered to be sensitive for the
environment. The reporting practices have been grouped into a number of cate-
gories, as follows: type of environmental reporting provided; sections of the annual
report devoted to environmental reporting; corporate environmental policies and
projects; natural environment protection activities and achievements; and dis-
closure of environmental data in the annual accounts.

Finally, we have considered whether the fact that a company is quoted on the
stock market, or that a parent company is foreign-based, or that it belongs to a
regulated sector, are diŒerentiating factors with respect to environmental reporting
behaviour. The main conclusions are as follows:

The environmental reporting of these sample companies has a fundamentally
narrative character, although there has been an increase in both quantitative
and ® nancial reporting, as well as in the number of companies that are report-
ing.
The factors analysed do not allow us to detect signi® cant diŒerences, except
for whether the parent company is foreign-based.
As a consequence, there is no signi® cant evidence that during the period
analysed the environmental reporting behaviour of Spanish company man-
agement has tried to satisfy their stakeholders.

1. INTRODUCTION

During the last few decades there has been a signi® cant increase in society’s
awareness of ecological and social matters, which has been re¯ ected in the
proliferation of non-governmenta l organizations and other social movements.

The criticisms voiced by society as a whole with respect to the social and
environmental impact of companies and, more particularly, the ecological
conscience of many consumers, has obliged companies to adopt environmental
policies and introduce ecological quality controls, which have themselves
become the subject of international standards (for example, ISO 14000 and
ECO Management and Audit Scheme EMAS).

Against this background, research in corporate social reporting (CSR) tries
to evaluate the scope of the social policies and activities of companies through
the analysis of the information they disclose. However, this process is ham-
pered by the absence of systematic reporting on the part of organizations
(Gray et al., 1995).

Within CSR, researchers have begun to note the emergence of environ-
mental reporting in annual reports (Harte and Owen, 1991). This information
has fundamentally taken the form of voluntary disclosure (Gray et al., 1995),
which has been interpreted according to diŒerent theoretical approaches (Tilt,
1994).

Thus, according to stakeholder theory, the environmental information
which is disclosed voluntarily by companies is a response to the existence of
users who are legitimately interested in the behaviour of the company1 and
who compete with traditional users (Freeman, 1984; Woodward et al., 1993;
Roberts, 1992; Donaldson and Preston, 1995; Fekrat et al., 1996).

Adopting this theoretical framework, the objective of this paper is, ® rst,
to determine the environmental reporting practices of industrial companies
operating in Spain and, second, to consider the relationship between these
practices and stakeholder pressure.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we brie¯ y review
the premises of stakeholder theory and analyse some earlier empirical studies
on social and environmental reporting practices, both internationall y and in
Spain. The research method is described in greater detail in Section 3. In
Sections 4 and 5 we present and discuss, respectively, the results of the
empirical work. Section 6 closes the paper with a summary and some con-
cluding remarks.

2. BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY

The concept of stewardship, the traditional function of ® nancial reporting, is
understood as the relationship between the managers and the shareholders of
a company (Mathews and Perera, 1991). This classical approach has been
modi® ed over time, by both doctrine and practice, towards one which con-
siders the usefulness of ® nancial reporting for decision-making purposes,
particularly in assisting shareholders and creditors, both actual and potential
(AAA, 1977).

A more extensive view of the role of ® nancial reporting considers that this
must be intended for a broad range of agents (stakeholders), who are interested

in the progress of the company (ASSC, 1975). However, in practice, most
accounting standards explicitly or implicitly maintain the investor (share-
holders and creditors) as the reference user (i.e. FASB, 1978).

This has given rise to a ® nancial accounting framework which suŒers from
considerable defects in some areas that are currently in great demand. One of
the most relevant examples is the provision of information of a social nature,
which has also come to be described as reporting on corporate social responsi-
bility.

In this sense, the recognition of stakeholders who demand social infor-
mation, together with the impact of activities that are harmful to the environ-
ment, have created a favourable context for the disclosure of data which re¯ ect
the interaction between the company and the environment. The progressive
increase in the number of obligatory rules has also contributed towards the
creation of this situation (Tilt, 1994).

According to the premises of stakeholder theory, management supplies
information designed to satisfy the stakeholders, fundamentall y the most
relevant (Roberts, 1992). This information may, in some cases, be of a nature
which generates negative reactions in the market (Meznar et al., 1994).

Traditionally, the response of the company to the demands of stakeholders
and to the absence of regulation has been to provide non-standardize d infor-
mation on the matters in question. Thus, social and environmental infor-
mation appears fundamentally in the form of voluntary disclosures (ISAR,
1992, 1994; FEE, 1993, 1995, 1996; Gray et al., 1995).

The results of the analyses into environmental disclosure carried out in

earlier works can be summarized as follows:

The environmental data provided are essentially qualitative (Adams et
al., 1995; Hackston and Milne, 1996) and positive (Guthrie and Parker,
1990; Deegan and Gordon, 1996). This fact could be related to the per-
ception on the part of management that the data are linked to the image
of the company (Jaggi and Zhao, 1996). The main consequence is that
users perceive the need to introduce obligatory standards (Deegan and
Rankin, 1997).
There are signi® cant diŒerences between industries in both the quantity
and quality of environmental information reported (Adams et al., 1995;
Gamble et al., 1995; Jaggi and Zhao, 1996). Thus, there is a signi® cant
relationship between the sectors with the greatest polluting potential and
a high level of disclosure (Freedman and Jaggi, 1996).
There are diŒerences in the nature of the environmental reporting, depend-
ing on the company’ s country of ultimate ownership (Adams et al., 1995;
Guthrie and Parker, 1990). Thus, when such a country has a high level of
social consciousness, for example, as in Sweden or Canada, then the
company provides more information by way of voluntary disclosure
(Gamble et al., 1996; Fekrat et al., 1996).

10 The European Accounting Review

There has been a positive evolution in the quantity of social and environ-
mental information reported as a response to the pressure exerted by
stakeholders (Gamble et al., 1995; Niskala and Pretes, 1995; Deegan and
Gordon, 1996).

Only a limited number of studies and empirical analyses on the disclosure of
social and environmental information have been carried out in Spain. Of
these, the following three are the most relevant:

Carmona and Carrasco (1988) analysed the social information reported
by sixty-one Spanish companies in 1985. They found that such reporting
was very limited in terms of both the quantity and quality of data,
especially in the area of the conservation of natural resources, where only
11.4% of the companies analysed provided such information. Similarly,
when seeking to verify the existence of an explicit social policy, they
found that only 40% of the companies made reference to it. The authors
concluded that there was still a long way to go before an adequate level
of social information reporting could be achieved.
Subsequently, Carrasco and Larrinaga (1995) surveyed 105 companies in
one of Spain’ s autonomous regions which suŒers particular environmental
problems, namely Andalusia, with the aim of evaluating the strategies,
policies and disclosure of external ® nancial information of these compan-
ies. The results concluded that the companies in question adopted passive
strategies with respect to the preservation of natural resources, and that
only legal obligation would force them to change (44.8% of the companies
surveyed responded in these terms). A second result was the very limited
presence of environmental policies, with 49.5% of the companies having
neither a member of management responsible for this area, nor a policy,
nor indeed budgets, associated with the environment. With respect to
external information, it was found that for the companies being analysed,
this was perceived as something positive, although the percentage of
companies that actually disclosed information was only 21.9% . Fur-
thermore, the information disclosed `is of a narrative type and lacks the
basic requirements in order for the accounting information to be useful’
(Carrasco and Larrinaga, 1995: 411).
Finally, Moneva and Llena (1996) examined the information on the
corporate social responsibility of forty-seven companies quoted on the
Madrid Stock Exchange, with particular reference to the quantity and
quality of the data and its association with the sector of activity and the
pro® tability of the company. Essentially in line with the results of the
earlier cited papers, the authors found that the social information dis-
closed was limited, fundamentally of a narrative character and located
outside the annual accounts. Furthermore, the sectors that are most
sensitive to social aspects appear to disclose more information, and in
greater detail. Finally, they found no empirical evidence that the pro-

® tability of the company is a determining factor in either the quantity or
quality of the information disclosed.

It should be noted that during the period under analysis (1992 4), there
were no obligatory rules on environmental reporting in Spain. However, this
situation has been altered by the recent inclusion in the accounting regulations
of obligatory environmental data for companies operating in the energy sector,
and will almost certainly give rise to a change in the behaviour of the com-
panies which operate in Spain.

3. RESEARCH METHOD

Data collection

In line with the works of Gamble et al. (1995), Niskala and Pretes (1995) and
Deegan and Gordon (1996), we decided ® rst to adopt the general approach
of analysing the annual reports of large companies operating in Spain in those
sectors that are particularly sensitive to ecological matters. Thereafter, and in
order to select the speci® c sample, we requested the published annual accounts
and environmental reports corresponding to the years 1992, 1993 and 1994
from a total of 160 companies belonging to these types of sector. The com-
panies were drawn from the 1996 supplement `The 2,500 Biggest Companies’,
published by the Spanish ® nancial journal Actualidad EconoÂ mica.

The selection criteria were as follows:

That the company had an annual turnover of more than 10,000 million
pesetas, given that size is a relevant factor in the voluntary disclosure of
information containing environmental data (Firth, 1979; Chow and
Wong-Boren, 1987).
That the company belonged to an industrial sector which has a clear
interrelationship with the environment, based on the ISAR guidelines
(1992, 1994, 1995), as well as other studies (Niskala and Pretes, 1995;
Deegan and Gordon, 1996). Furthermore, we chose companies that car-
ried out activities which have an environmental impact.2 Sectors with
an indirect impact on natural resources, such as banks and insurance
companies, were excluded.
To seek information on a similar number of companies in each sector, in
order to avoid the possibility of overrepresente d sectors.

From the original 160 companies, the information we requested was provided
by seventy (43.75% ), making-up a ® nal sample similar to those used in other
works (Fekrat et al., 1996; Niskala and Pretes, 1995).

The main characteristics of the sample are as follows:

Only 57% of the companies are quoted on the Madrid Stock Exchange.

12 The European Accounting Review

Thus, the sample is eŒectively made up of two groups of companies with
diŒerent information requirements and users.
A total of 24.28% of the companies belong to sectors which have regulated
prices; that is to say, water distribution and the production and dis-
tribution of electricity and gas.
The ownership of the majority of the companies is in Spanish hands
(87.1% ), with seven being owned by companies from other EU countries,
and only two being owned by companies from outside these geographical
ambits.

Database analysis

The study of the environmental data re¯ ected in the annual reports has
been carried out by the content analysis method, an approach that has been
commonly employed in CSR research (Zeghal and Ahmed, 1990; Gray et al.,
1995). This analysis technique is based on detecting the presence or absence
of information covering a number of diŒerent subject areas, with each subject
area being the unit of analysis (Guthrie and Mathews, 1985). Thus, the
presence of a subject area is given the value 1 if it is reported, independent of
its scope or of any other factor, and given the value 0 if the subject area is not
re¯ ected in the annual report.

The annual report corresponding to each company and to each year in
question was reviewed in accordance with a research instrument (Guthrie and
Mathews, 1985; Guthrie and Parker, 1990; Niskala and Pretes, 1995) divided
into ® ve categories, each of which included diŒerent subject areas. These
categories are as follows:

1 Type of environmental reporting provided.
2 Sections of the annual report devoted to environmental reporting.
3 Corporate environmental policies and projects.
4 Natural environment protection activities and achievements.
5 Disclosure of environmental data in the annual accounts.

The annual reports were analysed separately by the authors, who assigned
the above-mentione d valuation to each subject area. The limited number of
con¯ icts that arose were resolved by agreeing the most appropriate valuation
(Gamble et al., 1996).

In order to determine whether the evolution of the information between
1992 and 1994 is signi® cant, we have applied the Wilcoxon non-parametri c
test. This allows us to test the null hypothesis that the behaviour is similar in
the two years, as well as to determine the number of companies which have
improved or worsened in terms of the disclosure of environmental infor-
mation. The null hypothesis is rejected if the p-values associated to the statistic
are lower than 0.05.

At the same time, and in order to determine whether this evolution has

Downloaded by [Fac Psicologia/Biblioteca] at 02:26 18 July 2011 
Annual reports of large companies in Spain

13

been constant in all the years under study, we have applied the Friedman 2
test, whose null hypothesis is that the same behaviour exists in all three years.
Once again, p-values associated to the statistic lower than 0.05 allow us to
reject the null hypothesis.

Furthermore, when compiling and classifying the data, we observed that
there are signi® cant diŒerences in both the type and quantity of information
disclosed by the diŒerent companies in the sample. Thus, we have tried to
verify whether there is any distinctive characteristic in these companies that
acts as a determining factor in their environmental behaviour and, therefore,
in their corporate environmental reporting.

In this regard, we have considered the following attributes as possible

diŒerentiating factors:

Being quoted on the stock market. Companies that are quoted on the
stock market are usually subject to greater informative requirements
with respect to various aspects of their operations, including those of an
environmental character. Thus, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) in the USA, and the Canadian provincial securities commissions
require environmental data (Gray et al., 1996: 146). However, the Spanish
Securities and Exchange Commission (ComisioÂ n Nacional del Mercado
de Valores) does not require any environmental disclosure from the com-
panies quoted on the Spanish stock market.
Whether the company belongs to an economic sector whose prices are
subject to government regulation. As we mentioned earlier, our sample
contains companies belonging to such sectors, namely water distribution
and the production and distribution of electricity and gas. The strategic
and economic importance of such sectors in Spain, as well as their impact
on the environment, has given rise not only to price control on the part
of the government, but also to a demanding environmental regulation.
Thus, a speci® c standard has recently been established for the sector in
the area of ® nancial information, although, as Larrinaga (1999) indicates,
this standard re¯ ects a practice that is already widely followed in a vol-
untary manner. Despite this, there is no previous signi® cant evidence of
diŒerentiated environmental reporting behaviour on the part of this sector
(Freedman and Jaggi, 1996; Moneva and Llena, 1996).
The country where the head o ce of the company is located. This could
give rise to a situation whereby the informative behaviour of the company
being analysed is related to that of its parent company.

In order to test these attributes, both in each individual category and
overall, we have applied the Mann Whitney test, whose null hypothesis
is that the environmental information of each alternative, that is to say,
quoted/non-quoted, regulated/unregulated, national/foreign-owned, does not
signi® cantly diŒer. Once again, this null hypothesis is rejected for p-values
lower than 0.05.

Downloaded by [Fac Psicologia/Biblioteca] at 02:26 18 July 2011 
14 The European Accounting Review

There are other relevant attributes, such as the pro® tability of the company,
that we have chosen not to test, given that this variable has already been
studied by a variety of authors, who have reached the conclusion that it is not
a determining factor of behaviour (Freedman and Jaggi, 1988; Moneva and
Llena, 1996).

4. DEVELOPMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTING
PRACTICES IN SPAIN

When applying the research instrument to the seventy companies comprising
the sample, the following results were obtained.

Type of environmental reporting provided

As mentioned earlier, one objective of this work is to test the level of infor-
mation of a narrative character and its evolution over the three years under
study, in order to determine the degree of involvement of Spanish companies
with their stakeholders (see Table 1). This narrative information has itself
been divided into two subject areas:

Generic information: which includes very general data on the inter-
relationship between the company’ s activity and the natural environment.
For example, a declaration of intent to adopt an environmental policy,
the acceptance of sustainability, etc.
Qualitative information: which includes details about environmental poli-
cies and activities which are either planned or have already been under-
taken by the company. For example, becoming a party to an external
environmental commitment, measures adopted to obtain environmental
certi® cations, etc.

Similarly, the quantitative information has also been divided into two subject
areas:

Quantitative non-® nancial information: which oŒers quanti® ed details of
the impact and measures adopted with respect to the environment. For
example, the amount of reductions in pollution emissions, volume of
recycled materials, energy savings, etc.
Financial reporting: which discloses the economic data on environmental
activities and events.

We have found that environmental information has signi® cantly increased
at the global level during the period 1992 4 (signi® cance
0.05),
fundamentally because ® fteen companies (21.4% ) disclosed more information,
whilst only three reduced the amount disclosed.

0.02

Thus, whilst the increase in narrative information is not statistically
relevant, the quantitative and ® nancial information has increased signi® cantly.

Given that this type of data are considered as being less biased and more
reliable for the user, this would suggest greater involvement on the part
of companies in environmental matters, with the disclosure of more useful
information to the stakeholders.

It is interesting to note that 12.8% of the companies in the sample (that is to
say, nine) increased the amount of quantitative and/or ® nancial information,
whilst only one company reduced it. Later, when we analysed ® nancial data,
we noted that this increase could be related with the tendency for more
companies to report on environmental expenses, investments and liabilities.

Sections of the annual report devoted to environmental reporting

The annual report is used to disclose environmental data (Table 2) in a variety
of ways and there are several reporting alternatives, as follows:

(a) Compulsory reporting

annual accounts: balance sheet, pro® t and loss account and notes to the
annual accounts;
management report: compulsory in Spain for medium and large-sized
limited companies.
(b) Voluntary reporting

general corporate information;
chairman’s report or letter to the shareholders;
separate environmental report.

Here, we found that compulsory reporting statements were not widely used
to disclose environmental data, except in the case of the management report
(approximatel y half the companies in the sample). This would appear to
reinforce the view that Spanish companies are interested in voluntarily inform-
ing their stakeholders, given that as regards the management report:

the minimum content provided for in Article 202 of Spanish Companies Act
is generic and makes no reference to the inclusion of environmenta l matters;
the directors are legally liable for the truthfulness of the information
provided in it;
® nally, the auditors of the company must report on whether the ® nancial
information contained in the management report is in accordance with
the annual accounts.

In this regard, we found no signi® cant change in the behaviour of the sample
companies during the period analysed, which appears to demonstrate a con-
tinued practice of using the management report to re¯ ect environmental
matters.

By contrast, we did ® nd that a signi® cant improvement had taken place with
respect to voluntary reporting, especially as a consequence of the progressive
introduction of separate environmental reports (two companies issued such

reports in 1992 and seven in 1994). These voluntary reports which are not
a response to the requirements imposed by external commitments place
environmental information at the disposal of any user. As a result, they
represent active behaviour on the part of management towards those inter-
ested stakeholders.

Corporate environmental policies and projects

We examined three diŒerent courses of action for overall corporate involve-
ment in environmental protection matters, namely:

Implementation of the environmental audit.
Adoption of an environmental policy, such as the Valdez Principles,
always provided that these re¯ ect the basic lines of activity.
Becoming parties to external environmental commitments, such as
Responsible Care (the Chemical sector) or the `DeclaracioÂ n IbeÂ rica’ on
the sustainable management of forests (the Wood Pulp and Paper sectors).

In general terms, and as can be appreciated from the contents of Table 3, the
Spanish companies in the sample have taken an important qualitative step in
the area of environmental policies and projects and their disclosure, where we
have found a marked increase (signi® cance
0.05). Thus, during the
period under analysis, twenty of the sample companies have evolved posi-
tively, supplying more information, whilst only three have reduced the quan-
tity of information provided.

0.001

Speci® cally, the implementation of environmental audits in Spanish com-
panies is beginning to develop, in such a way that 15.7% of the companies
analysed carried out such an audit in 1994 (only 7.1% in 1992). In this regard,
it could be that the knowledge of EMAS coming at some stage in the future
may have encouraged companies to undertake some preliminary environ-
mental audits. There are no companies in our sample that followed EMAS,
because this regulation did not come into eŒect until April 1995.

Finally, attention should also be drawn to the increased frequency of
reported environmental policies (from 14 to 26 companies over the period)
and the acquisition of a large volume of external environmental commitments
(from 13 to 21), making an additional element available to stakeholders in
the decision-making process.

Natural environment protection activities and achievements

Table 4 shows the speci® c environmental protection activities carried out and
performed by the companies in the sample, whilst Table 5 contains infor-
mation on speci® c achievements in these areas.

These activities refer to a number of diŒerent and very speci® c aspects
(Niskala and Pretes, 1995), such as atmospheric or air pollution, solid waste,

liquid waste, recycling, safety, product and clean production processes, and
energy saving and e ciency. These areas are of general interest for the com-
panies analysed, even though some of them are not directly aŒected by all of
these activities.

We have found a signi® cant increase in the information disclosed, with
respect to both activities and achievements, fundamentally with respect to
atmospheric pollution, liquid waste, product and clean production processes,
and energy saving and e ciency. On the other hand, we have observed that
the informative area which received less attention during the period under
study, was that of safety.

It should be noted that the main activity for which information is provided
is that of the reduction of liquid waste (32.9% in 1992 and 45.7% in 1994),
although this is not the main activity for which data on achievements are
provided. In this regard, the companies oŒered more data on achievements in
the activities of air pollution (24.3% in 1992 and 27.1% in 1994) and energy
saving and e ciency (12.9% in 1992 and 24.3% in 1994).

In any event, as can be seen from Tables 4 and 5, the number of companies
that publish information on achievements is lower than the number which do
so with respect to activities. However, the informative increase is statistically
signi® cant in both cases, reinforcing the view of the progressive increase in
the social consciousness of Spanish management.

Disclosure of environmental data in the annual accounts

The results set out in Table 2 show that the use of the annual accounts (balance
sheet, pro® t and loss account and notes to the annual accounts) to report
environmental data was very limited.

Let us now consider precisely how this limited information has been dis-
closed in these annual accounts and in what form. The results are presented
in Table 6.

0.004

Here we can note that there has been a signi® cant increase (signi® -
cance
0.05) in the ® nancial data disclosed in the annual accounts
during the period under study, fundamentally because nine of the sample
companies have reported this section. Given that there were no obligatory
standards on the reporting of environmental data, this would appear to
indicate a progressive increase in the degree of involvement on the part of
companies, and of these responding to stakeholders who diŒer in nature from
the traditional users.

We should particularly note the quantitative increase in the number of
companies which report on environmental expenses, investments and pro-
visions for environmental liabilities.

5. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

The environmental reporting published by companies operating in Spain is
basically focused on the use of generic data, with a very limited use of strictly

® nancial data. These overall results are consistent with those obtained in other
geographical ambits (Niskala and Pretes, 1995; Gamble et al., 1996; Hackston
and Milne, 1996), and similar to those in earlier works on Spanish companies
(Carmona and Carrasco, 1988; Carrasco and Larrinaga, 1995; Moneva and
Llena, 1996).

However, the presence of quantitative and ® nancial reporting is growing
continuously, mirroring the situation at the international level (Gamble et al.,
1995; Niskala and Pretes, 1995; Deegan and Gordon, 1996). One important
result of our analysis is the clear response on the part of the sample companies
to the greater participation of stakeholders, given that information is being
disclosed voluntarily in the management report.

The results obtained suggest that the situation in Spain is passing through
a period of development and improvement with respect to the disclosure of
environmental information that is useful for users, particularly on the part of
large companies. This represents a signi® cant advance in the behaviour of the
management of companies which operate in Spain (Carrasco and Larrinaga,
1995; Moneva and Llena, 1996).

Furthermore, we have found no signi® cant diŒerences in any of the three
years under study with respect to the information disclosed by the quoted and
non-quote d companies included in our sample: see Table 7. This would suggest
that, although quoted companies may well have a larger number of stake-
holders, this does not suppose that they disclose more information. Nor have
we found any signi® cant diŒerences for each subject area.

Similarly, the fact that a company belongs to a sector which is subject to
government regulation does not appear to be a diŒerentiating attribute in any
of the reporting aspects analysed. This con® rms the results obtained in
Moneva and Llena (1996).

Finally, we should note that there are no global diŒerences between the
environmental information disclosed by companies with a Spanish parent
company and those with a foreign parent company. Nevertheless, in some
subject areas, such as quantitative and ® nancial information, achievements
in environmental areas and the disclosure of environmental expenses and
investments, the sample companies with a foreign parent company disclosed
more information during the three years under study. These results are con-
sistent with those obtained at the international level (Adams et al., 1995;
Gamble et al., 1996).

6. CONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Company awareness is essential in the protection of natural resources, as a
basic element to achieve sustainable development (ISAR, 1992; EEC, 1993;
Gray et al., 1996). The incorporation of environmental policies and pro-
grammes and the disclosure of information on the ecological impact of the
company are two essential factors for such development.

26 The European Accounting Review

In the light of this, a number of bodies have established recommendations
for the inclusion of environmental reporting in the ® nancial statements and
other parts of the annual report (ISAR, 1994; FEE, 1995; ICAEW, 1992).

The results we have obtained in this study suggest that in Spain there is a
limited application of these recommendations on the part of companies at
the voluntary and narrative level, as well as an increasing, but still slight,
incorporation of ® nancial data. The informative increase in terms of both
subjects and the number of companies is probably the result of external
pressure exerted on the sectors which have a more negative impact on the
environment. However, the scarce presence of quantitative , ® nancial and non-
® nancial information, similar to that found in other geographical ambits
(Guthrie and Parker, 1990; Adams et al., 1995; Hackston and Milne, 1996;
Deegan and Gordon, 1996) implies a limited usefulness for the stakeholders.
In this sense, quotation on the stock market does not appear to be a
signi® cant factor in the supply of a greater quantity of environmental data,
despite the level of control and the high number of stakeholders that quotation
implies. Thus, this factor does not provide us with enough evidence to con-
clusively determine that the information disclosed by Spanish companies with
respect to the environmental impact of their activities is linked to satisfying
stakeholders.

Similarly, nor does it appear that belonging to a regulated sector

electricity
implies a greater degree of environmental reporting, even

and water supply
though the level of social pressure exerted on these industries is higher.

By contrast, there do appear to be other factors that suggest a progressive
increase in social consciousness by Spanish management towards their stake-
holders. Thus, there is evidence that a company with a foreign parent supplies
more quantitative environmental reporting, especially ® nancial, possibly as a
consequence of the situation in the parent company’s country. At the same
time, we can note a certain increase in the number of companies that reported
on environmental matters during the period under study. This may well be
due to social pressure, rather than legal requirements, given that there were
no obligatory standards in force at that time.

In our view, these results suggest that policy-makers should consider the
need to establish environmental disclosure requirements that are useful for
the stakeholders (Deegan and Rankin, 1997). This is a clearly pressing need:
current practices do not identify environmental degradation, and purely ® n-
ancial information does not re¯ ect the negative ecological attitude of the
company.

Our results should be interpreted with caution, given that we have con-
sidered the evolution for only three years. These were very signi® cant years
for the Spanish accounting framework, due to the regulatory change that took
place during this period, but it would be necessary to extend the number of
years studied in order to evaluate recent legal requirements. Furthermore, it
is necessary for us to deepen our analysis of the quality of the environmental

reporting, in order to obtain more evidence on the behaviour of management
with respect to their stakeholders. Finally, future research could also be
extended to the analysis of other sectors, whose direct environmental impact
is less, but which are themselves the subject of ecological risks as a result of
their activities, such as the insurance and banking sectors.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The authors acknowledge the helpful comments of Rob Gray on an earlier
draft of this article. We also want to thank two anonymous referees for their
suggestions.

NOTES

1 With respect to the de® nition of stakeholder, this has taken various forms. For
example, Freeman (1984) considers that these are the individuals aŒected or poten-
tially aŒected by the decisions made by companies. Sternberg (1997) considers this
to be too generic. Therefore, Gray et al. (1996: Ch. 1) includes the most relevant
agents within their de® nition; that is to say: shareholders, creditors, management,
employees and trade unions, customers, suppliers, members of the local community,
consumers and society in general.

2 Details of the companies which comprise the sample are available from the authors

upon request.
