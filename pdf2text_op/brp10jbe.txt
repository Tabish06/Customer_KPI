The Impact of Board Diversity and Gender
Composition on Corporate Social
Responsibility and Firm Reputation

Stephen Bear

ABSTRACT. This article explores how the diversity of
board resources and the number of women on boards affect
firms’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings, and
how, in turn, CSR influences corporate reputation. In
addition,
this article examines whether CSR ratings
mediate the relationships among board resource diversity,
gender composition, and corporate reputation. The OLS
regression results using lagged data for independent and
control variables were statistically significant for the gender
composition hypotheses, but not for the resource diversity-
based hypotheses. CSR ratings had a positive impact on
reputation and mediated the relationship between the
number of women on the board and corporate reputation.

KEY WORDS: corporate reputation, corporate social
responsibility, board diversity, boards of directors, gender
composition

Introduction

Corporate reputation refers to ‘‘publics’ cumulative
judgment of ﬁrms over time’’ (Fombrun and Shanley,
1990, 235). Research has demonstrated a broad range
of beneﬁts associated with a positive reputation. A
good reputation enhances a ﬁrm’s ability to attract job
applicants (Gatewood et al., 1993). Reputation affects
employee retention as employees who feel
their
company is well regarded by external groups have
higher job satisfaction and a lower intention to leave
their organizations (Riordan et al., 1997). A positive
reputation also enhances corporate branding, enabling
a company to use its brand equity to launch new
products and enter new markets (Dowling, 2006).
Reputation can positively affect ﬁnancial performance,
institutional investment, and share price. A study by
Mercer Investment Consulting indicated that 46% of

institutional investors consider environmental, social,
and corporate governance when making investment
decisions, and McKinsey reports that
institutional
investors will pay a premium (12–14%) for well-gov-
erned companies (Fombrun, 2006). Dowling (2006)
argues that successful ﬁrms have a greater chance of
sustaining superior performance over time if they also
possess relatively good reputations.

institutional

Fombrun and Shanley (1990) identiﬁed a wide range
of
factors that contribute to a positive reputation
including accounting measures of proﬁtability and risk,
market value, media visibility,
stock
holdings, dividend yield, ﬁrm size, and demonstration
of social concern. More recent research has identiﬁed
other reputation-enchancing factors, including cus-
tomer satisfaction (Bontis et al., 2007), stakeholder
familiarity (McCorkindale, 2008), corporate cam-
paigns (Ellen et al., 2006), and corporate citizenship
programs (Gardberg and Fombrun, 2006). In this
article, we propose to explore how on boards of
directors the diversity of board resources and the
number of women on boards affect ﬁrms’ corporate
social responsibility (CSR) ratings, and how, in turn,
CSR inﬂuences corporate reputation.

With the increased public scrutiny around boards
and corporate governance, one expects board com-
position to affect corporate reputation, especially
when it comes to characteristics such as the diversity of
board resources and board gender composition. The
term diversity subsumes distinct conceptions and
operationalizations of group conﬁgurations (DiTo-
maso and Post, 2007; Harrison and Klein, 2007). In
this study, we conceive of diversity of board resources
as variety in the resources that board members bring to
the board, and of gender diversity as gender compo-
sition, more speciﬁcally as the number of female

directors on boards. As others have shown, having
more women on boards enhances ﬁrms’ reputation
(Bernardi et al., 2006; Bilimoria, 2000; Brammer
et al., 2009), in part, presumably, because of the
increased
boards
(Bilimoria, 2000; Kramer et al., 2006; Ramirez, 2003;
Sellers, 2007). However, whether and how diversity
of board resources (e.g., professional backgrounds of
directors) affects corporate reputation is an under-
studied question that we propose to address here.
Furthermore, the mechanisms through which diver-
sity of board resources and gender composition affect
reputation have received limited attention. Studies
that evaluate a direct relationship between board
gender composition and ﬁrm’s outcomes (e.g., rep-
utation) usually assume that board gender composi-
tion acts as a signal (e.g., the value ﬁrms place on
hiring, retaining, and advancing women) which
directly inﬂuences outside evaluators (e.g., investors,
inﬂuential business magazines). However, it is also
likely that gender composition and diversity of board
resources affect ﬁrms’ social performance, which, in
turn, bolsters their reputation. Building on the study
of Mattingly and Berman (2006), we view CSR in
terms of institutional strength and technical strength.
Institutional strength of CSR is based on positive
actions toward diversity and community stakeholders.
Technical strength of CSR is based on positive actions
toward consumers, stockholders, and employees.

Because of

the rising importance of CSR in
evaluating ﬁrms (Kakabadse, 2007) and because of
evidence that board diversiﬁcation improves at least
some aspects of CSR (Post et al., 2011), we examine,
in this article, the role of CSR as a mediator of the
board composition–corporate reputation relation-
ship. In order to evaluate the indirect link between
board diversity, the number of women on the board,
and ﬁrm’s reputation through CSR, we examine the
relationship between CSR and corporate reputation,
and the impact of board diversity and the number of
women on the board on CSR. Finally, we examine
whether CSR mediates the relationship between
board diversity and corporate reputation. This article
is structured as follows: ﬁrst is a review of the literature
that provides the theoretical bases for this article
including the hypotheses for the research, followed by
an explanation of the methods used to collect and
analyze the study data. This article then continues
with the presentation and discussion of results, and

concludes with a review of contributions, limitations,
and directions for future research.

Literature review

CSR and corporate reputation

Barnett (2007, 801) deﬁned CSR as ‘‘a discretionary
allocation of corporate resources toward improving
social welfare that serves as a means of enhancing
relationships with key stakeholders.’’ Mattingly and
Berman (2006) utilize the Kinder, Lydenberg,
Domini (KLD) social ratings data to develop two
constructs that reﬂect positive CSR. The ﬁrst con-
struct, institutional strength, is composed of positive
actions toward the community and diversity stake-
holders. These include actions like charitable giving,
volunteer programs, the promotion of women and
minorities, and women and minority subcontracting.
The second construct, technical strength, is com-
posed of positive actions toward consumers, stock-
holders, and employees. These include actions like
products with social beneﬁts,
transparency in
reporting social and environmental performance,
and health and safety programs
(Mattingly and
Berman, 2006). Institutional strength and technical
strength reﬂect programs that enhance corporate
reputation with key stakeholders. Gardberg and
Fombrun (2006, 330) liken these CSR or citizenship
programs
in R&D which create
‘‘intangible assets’’ that build reputation and help
companies grow their global businesses.

to investments

Actions that demonstrate CSR can bolster corpo-
rate reputation. Branco and Rodrigues (2006) have
argued that CSR enables ﬁrms to improve reputation
with a broad range of stakeholders including cus-
tomers, suppliers, competitors, bankers, and investors.
Fombrun and Shanley (1990) found that corporations
that had a foundation and that gave more to charity
had more positive reputations. These actions served as
signals for responsiveness to social concerns and built
reputation among stakeholders. Importantly, when
CSR programs are communicated to the public they
build corporate reputation and credibility (Pfau et al.,
2008). Russo and Fouts (1997) found a positive
association between pro-environment reputation and
return on assets. Donker et al. (2008) examined the
codes of ethics of major Canadian companies and

209

found that the inclusion of key words that reﬂect
CSR, including values like respect, responsibility,
integrity and trust, were positively correlated with the
ﬁrm’s market-to-book value.

Finally, stakeholders value a positive image for CSR
because it serves to mitigate risk. Fombrun and Gardberg
(2000) argue that CSR can be a safety net by reducing
reputational damage. A positive reputation for CSR can
reduce the damage from negative publicity during a crisis
(Vanhamme and Grobben, 2009).

Hypothesis 1: CSR strength ratings are positively

associated with corporate reputation.

Board diversity, board composition, and CSR

resources

Two organization theories, resource dependence
theory and agency theory, provide the broad theo-
retical underpinnings for how board diversity and
composition inﬂuence ratings for CSR and how, in
turn, CSR inﬂuences corporate reputation. These
theories were utilized because they represent two
key functions of the board (Hillman and Dalziel,
2003). Resource dependence theory offers
the
rationale for the board’s function of providing crit-
ical
to the ﬁrm including legitimacy,
advice, and counsel (Hillman and Dalziel, 2003).
These board resources offer the corporation support
in understanding and responding to its environment
(Boyd, 1990) that can help it better manage CSR
issues. Agency theory provides the rationale for the
board’s critical function of monitoring management
on behalf of
the shareholders (Eisenhardt, 1989;
Fama and Jensen, 1983). In order to exercise its
monitoring function the board needs the appropriate
mix of experience and capabilities to evaluate man-
agement and assess business
strategies and their
impact on CSR (Hillman and Dalziel, 2003). A third
organization theory, signaling, provides an additional
basis for our discussion of the relationship between
board gender composition and corporate reputation.

Diversity of director resources

An effective board provides resources to the cor-
poration including advice and counsel and links to

other organizations (Hillman and Dalziel, 2003).
These linkages can provide channels for communi-
cation with, and access to support from external
organizations (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). Hence,
board resources can help the ﬁrm manage business
challenges (Boyd, 1990) and enable it to deal more
effectively with external organizations
(Pfeffer,
1972). The board’s human capital resources are
based on the collective experience and expertise of
board members. This expertise includes insiders with
knowledge of company strategy and operations,
business experts with knowledge of corporate strat-
egy, support specialist with knowledge of legal and
regulatory affairs,
community inﬂuentials with
knowledge and relationships with external stake-
holders including the government and local com-
munities
al., 2000). Diversity of
experience is an important asset as studies with
management
functional
diversity can enhance team innovation through the
generation of alternative solutions and innovation
(Bantel and Jackson, 1989; Joshi and Roh, 2009).
Accordingly, the greater the diversity of board re-
sources, the greater the potential for understanding
and problem solving that can enable the board to
effectively address the business environment and
encourage positive ratings for CSR.

teams have shown that

(Hillman et

Board resource diversity may also enhance net-
work ties (Beckman and Haunschild, 2002). Insiders
offer strong internal network connections. Business
experts may offer connections to their focal ﬁrms
and to suppliers, customers, and other boards. Sup-
port specialists have connections with their focal
ﬁrms, customer networks, and with professional
associations. Community inﬂuentials may have sig-
niﬁcantly different networks composed of academic
experts, medical and scientiﬁc resources, legal net-
works, and investment and commercial banking
networks. Community inﬂuentials may also have
network ties to government agencies, community
groups, and non-proﬁt organizations (Hillman et al.,
2000). The variety of these network connections
will aid the corporation in understanding and
responding to its environment. These networks may
provide advice and expertise as well as connections
that foster collaboration and co-operation with key
stakeholders (Beckman and Haunschild, 2002). In
summary, the impact of a rich, diverse set of net-
work ties should enhance ratings of CSR, because

counsel from external organizations.

functions

The diversity of board resources also affects the
board’s critical function of monitoring management.
The relationship between the shareholders and the
management of a corporation is an agency rela-
tionship subject
to principal and agent conﬂict
(Jensen and Meckling, 1976) and to different per-
ceptions of risk (Eisenhardt, 1989). In order to
address these issues, shareholders appoint a board of
directors to monitor management. The board’s role
in monitoring includes
ranging from
strategy implementation to rewarding the CEO and
top managers of
the ﬁrm (Hillman and Dalziel,
2003). In order to effectively monitor management,
the board needs
‘‘skills, experience,
expertise and knowledge’’ (Hillman and Dalziel,
2003, 389). Diversity of director resources can help
provide these skills. Carpenter and Westphal (2001)
studied the impact of board ties and found that the
board’s ability to monitor and advise management is
related to expertise demonstrating that the back-
ground and experience of board members were
for effective monitoring. Diverse director

Hypothesis 2: Diversity of director resources is pos-

itively associated with CSR strength ratings.

Board gender composition

In addition to director resource diversity, gender
composition (i.e., the number of women on the
board) is expected to have a positive impact on
social capital and CSR. On boards, women are
more than twice as likely as men to hold a doctoral
degree (Hillman et al., 2002). Compared to male
directors,
female directors gain board experience
with smaller ﬁrms and are less likely to have prior
CEO or COO experience (Singh et al., 2008).
Female directors are more likely than male directors
to have expert backgrounds outside of business
and to bring different perspectives to the board
(Hillman et al., 2002). In addition, women on
boards are more likely than men to be support
specialists
(Hillman

and community inﬂuentials

that can be helpful

et
al., 2002). Therefore, having more female
directors may sensitize boards to CSR initiatives,
and provide perspectives
in
addressing issues of CSR. Research already suggests
that ﬁrms with a higher percentage of female board
members do in fact have a higher level of charitable
giving (Wang and Coffey, 1992; Williams, 2003),
more favorable work environments (Bernardi et al.,
2006; Johnson and Greening, 1999), and higher
levels of Environmental CSR (Post et al., 2011).

Increasing board gender diversity (which, for all
practical purposes, means increasing the number of
women on boards) can enhance decision making,
as a wider variety of perspectives and issues are
considered and a broader range of outcomes
is
assessed (Daily and Dalton, 2003). The presence of
more female directors may stimulate more partic-
ipative communication among board members, if
one assumes that gender differences in leadership
styles, as evidenced in some studies, also exist at
board director levels. If female directors are more
participative (Eagly et al., 2003), democratic (Eagly
and Johnson, 1990), and communal
than men
(Rudman and Glick, 2001),
then having more
women on a board could encourage more open
conversations among members of
the board. A
broader perspective may enable the board to better
assess the needs of diverse stakeholders. The result
may enhance the board’s ability to effectively
address CSR.

for

Another

theoretical

underpinning

the
expected relationship between board diversity and
corporate reputation is signaling theory. Signaling
theory assumes asymmetric information, and pro-
poses that parties may convey, intentionally or not,
relevant, but not readily observable information,
through observable signals that are meaningful to
the other party. In this regard,
the number of
women on a ﬁrm’s board may act as a signal to
observers indicating that the ﬁrm pays attention to
women and minorities, and is, therefore, socially
responsible. In support of the signaling argument, a
recent analysis of the annual report of Fortune 500
companies revealed that companies with higher
percentages of female directors are more likely to
display pictures of
them in their annual reports
(Bernardi et al., 2002). If one expects this signal of
having more women on the board to be effective,
then one would expect ﬁrms with a strong signal

to have more favorable CSR ratings, and in
broader terms, a better reputation. Some evidence
points that this is a plausible expectation. Fortune
500 companies with a higher percentage of female
directors were more likely to appear on Ethisphere
Magazine’s ‘‘World’s Most Ethical Company’’ list
(Bernardi et al., 2009).

Gender diversity can also affect the board’s critical
function of monitoring management. Having more
women on the board enhances the board’s expertise
by increasing the range of professional experience
and augmenting the number of board members
with advanced degrees (Hillman et al., 2002). These
added qualities brought in by female board members
enable the board to more effectively monitor man-
agement (Hillman and Dalziel, 2003). Women also
increase the demographic diversity of the board,
helping to ensure the board’s demographic differ-
ence from management. Westphal and Zajac (1995)
found that CEOs attempt to select board mem-
bers who are demographically similar to them to
secure support, and that this support led to higher
compensation. Consequently, gender diversity on
the board can help ensure demographic differences
from the CEO needed for effective monitoring.

reputation,

The effectiveness of women on boards may
increase with the addition of female directors. While
a single female director may have a positive impact on
ﬁrm’s
she may also face challenges.
Groups with a single minority member (e.g., a female
director) may consider that minority member to be a
token; they may perceive the minority individual as
less competent and of lower status. Consequently, the
group may fail to take the token’s opinions or con-
tributions
seriously (Brewer and Kramer, 1985;
Kanter, 1977a; Lord and Saenz, 1985). Furthermore,
research suggests that minority voices are not easily
expressed or heard in groups (Nemeth, 1986) because
social pressures encourage conformity with the
majority’s opinion (Asch, 1955). However, when a
group is faced with consistent opinions from multiple
minority members, it is more likely to consider and
learn from the minority voice (Asch, 1955). Empir-
ical evidence suggests that these processes may also be
at play on boards. For example, when a critical mass
of women (i.e., at least three) is represented on a
board, female directors are able to ask challenging
questions and work together to demonstrate collab-
oration in decision making (Konrad et al., 2008;

Kramer et al., 2006). It may be possible that there
could be too many women on the board. Just as all
male directors
lack diversity and reduce board
effectiveness, all female directors would lack diversity
and reduce effectiveness. In Fortune 500 companies
today, however, most boards have fewer than three
women and representation of more than four is rare
(Catalyst Census, 2009); therefore, a linear relation-
ship is hypothesized.

In summary, because female directors tend to have
different educational and professional backgrounds
from those of male directors, and may be more par-
ticipative and democratic in decision-making pro-
cesses, diversifying boards by increasing the number
of female directors may help ensure that more per-
spectives and issues are considered in the decision-
making process, leading the board to achieve better
decisions. The qualities that women bring to boards
may also provide better oversight of management
activities, because of
the increased heterogeneity
among the board, with top management teams, and
the CEO. Finally, the presence and the number of
women on boards may signal to stakeholders that the
ﬁrm pays attention to women and minorities, and is,
therefore, socially responsible. For all of these rea-
sons, we expect the following:

Hypothesis 3: The number of women board members
is positively associated with CSR strength ratings.

CSR as a mediator of the board diversity–corporate
reputation relationship

In this article, it has been argued that the diversity of
director resources and the number of women board
members have a positive impact on ratings for CSR.
It has been further argued that ratings for CSR have
a positive impact on corporate reputation. Accord-
ingly, it is expected that CSR ratings mediate the
relationship between board diversity and corporate
reputation.

Hypothesis 4A: CSR strength ratings mediate the
relationship between the diversity of board re-
sources and corporate reputation.

Hypothesis 4B: CSR strength ratings mediate the
relationship between the number of women
board members and corporate reputation.

Methods

Data sources

Stephen Bear et al.

Data for the dependent variables in the study were
obtained from the Fortune 2009 World’s Most
Admired Companies List based on a survey pub-
lished in March 2009 and conducted by Fortune at
the end of 2008. 2007 ratings for CSR, the mediator
variable, were obtained from the KLD database.
Data on the independent variables including the
diversity of director resources and the number of
women on the board were obtained from the
Mergent database of annual reports, as were the data
on CEO duality, a control variable in the study. Data
on stock price performance, a control variable in the
study, were obtained from the Wall Street Journal
Market Watch database. Finally return on assets, also
a control variable in the study was obtained from
COMPUSTAT. Data for all of the independent and
control variables in the study were taken from 2007
while the dependent variable was taken from the
Fortune 2009 survey conducted in the fourth quarter
of 2008. The independent variables were lagged
under the assumption that board members must be
in their roles for some time to have an impact on
CSR and company reputation.

Sample

The sample for this study consisted of companies
selected from Fortune’s 2009 Most Admired List.
The Fortune survey covers 64 industries, 39 pri-
marily U.S. industries and 25 international industries,
and the survey covered 689 companies including the
10 largest for each U.S. industry, and the 15 largest
for each international industry. For the 2009 list,
executives, directors, and analysts rated the compa-
nies within their own industry on nine criteria
including innovation, people management, use of
corporate assets,
responsibility, quality of
management, ﬁnancial soundness, long-term invest-
ment, quality of products/services, and global com-
petitiveness. These ratings were used to produce a list
of the top-ranked companies in each industry, for
each criterion, and an overall rating of total com-
pany’s reputation (Fortune: How We Pick, 2009).

social

Our sample was drawn from the health care
industry, because this industry has generally faced a
challenging public relations environment due to the
public’s reaction to rising health care costs. As such,
the boards of these companies may be more proac-
tive in managing corporate responsibility initiatives
to enhance stakeholder relations. All the 59 health
care companies
from the Fortune survey were
selected as the sample frame for this study. They
represent health care insurance and managed care
(10), health care medical facilities (10), health care
pharmacy and other services (8), pharmaceuticals
(13), medical and other precision equipment (11),
and wholesalers’ health care (7). Only those ﬁrms
with complete data for all study variables and present
in both the Fortune and KLD databases were utilized
resulting in 51 ﬁrms in the study.

Dependent variable

Ratings for ﬁrm’s reputation were drawn from the
Fortune 2009 list of the World’s Most Admired
Companies. The Fortune ratings have been exten-
sively studied and researchers have concluded that
ﬁnancial performance has been shown to be a sig-
niﬁcant factor in the rating (Brown and Perry, 1995;
Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Fryxell and Wang,
1994; McGuire et al., 1988). Accordingly, measures
of ﬁnancial performance are included as controls in
the study.

Mediator variable

Ratings for CSR were drawn from the KLD database.
The KLD ratings are based on ratings of strengths and
concerns in a number of areas including community,
corporate governance, diversity, employee relations,
the environment,
and product. Mattingly and
Berman (2006, 20) found that the strength ratings
were ‘‘empirically and conceptually distinct’’ from
the concern’s ratings and that researchers needed to
separately utilize the strengths and concern’s ratings.
For the purposes of this study, we focus on the two
social performance strength constructs developed by
Mattingly and Berman (2006): institutional strength

and technical strength. Institutional strength is com-
posed of positive (strength) measures for community
and diversity issues. Technical strength is composed of
positive (strength) measures for product, government,
and employee issues.

Independent variables

The two distinct independent variables in the model,
the diversity of director resources and the number of
women on the board, are deﬁned and operational-
ized as follows. Director resource diversity describes
the variety in professional background, experience,
and network connections among members of the
board. A value of director diversity is that the vari-
ations in background and business experience will
enhance board understanding of the ﬁrms’ external
environment and support effective decision making.
Diversity of director resources will also provide
network connections and enhanced legitimacy with
external audiences.

According to the typology developed by Hillman
et al. (2000), four distinct types of director resources
were recognized. Insiders were deﬁned as current
or
retired members of management. Business
experts were deﬁned as executives and ofﬁcers of
public corporations excluding insiders and support
specialists were deﬁned as
specialists. Support
executives and ofﬁcers of
law ﬁrms, commercial
banks, investment banks, accounting ﬁrms, adver-
tising and public relations agencies, and consulting
ﬁrms and private investors. Community inﬂuentials
were deﬁned as current and former academics,
physicians, government ofﬁcials, leaders of founda-
tions and not-for-proﬁt organizations. Classiﬁcation
was based on the current position held, or in the
case of individuals who had retired, their last posi-
tion held.

As the value of director resource diversity is the
variety of experience and knowledge, director
diversity is operationalized with Blau’s index. Blau’s
index measures the distribution of members across
different categories of experience, expertise, or
demographic background, and is the most com-
monly used measure of diversity-as-variety (Harrison
and Klein, 2007). It is operationalized as the differ-
ence between 1 and the sum of the proportion of

unit members p in each of the kth categories that
compose the group.

The number of women on the board is opera-
tionalized by a count of female directors. The value
that women bring to the board is differing perspec-
tives that may enhance director understanding of
the external environment. This supports effective
decision making and may enhance ratings for CSR.

Control variables

CEO duality is deﬁned as the presence of a single
individual holding the role of Chairman and Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO). The presence of a dual
Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer could impact
the effectiveness of board monitoring, and so it is
included as a control variable in the study.

Because previous studies have shown the impact of
ﬁnancial performance on reputation (Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990; Fryxell and Wang, 1994; McGuire
et al., 1988), the change in ﬁrm stock price for 2007 is
included as a control. In addition, return on assets has
been utilized as a measure of the efﬁciency of man-
agement in generating earnings. The industry of the
companies in the study was controlled by the selec-
tion of the sample; all ﬁrms who participate in this
study are in the health care industry. Given the
sample size, we attempted to be parsimonious in the
control variables we included in our model since
board size is a marker of number of women, we did
not use board size as a direct control as the effects of
board size would be substantially overlapping (Pear-
son correlation 0.657, p < 0.01) with the effects of
the number of women on the board.

Analysis

Mediation was tested using the procedure outlined
by Baron and Kenny (1986). First, the relationship
between the independent variables (board resource
diversity and the number of women on the board)
and the mediator variable (CSR ratings) were
determined. Second, the relationship between the
independent variables (board resource diversity and


214

Stephen Bear et al.

the number of women on the board) and the
dependent variable (overall corporate reputation)
was assessed. Third, the relationship between the
mediator (CSR ratings) and the dependent variable
(corporate reputation) was assessed. Finally,
the
effect of the independent variables on the dependent
variable was measured with and without the pres-
ence of the mediator to conﬁrm mediation.

Results

Table I contains descriptive means, standard devia-
tions, and correlations for all the variables. The mean

corporate reputation rating was 5.866 with a standard
deviation of 0.917 and a range of 3.62–7.68. The
average diversity of board resources is fairly high
(0.617), and its standard deviation is fairly small
(0.123), suggesting that the ﬁrms in our sample may
be somewhat consistent in the variety of resources
that directors bring to the board. The average
number of women on these boards was 1.765 with a
standard deviation of 1.069, and a range of 0–6.

Hypothesis 3 predicted that the number of female
board members would be positively associated with
KLD strength ratings for CSR. The coefﬁcient for the
number of women board members was positive
and statistically signiﬁcant for institutional strength

ingly, this hypothesis was supported.

Table IV provides the results for the regression
analyses of the effect of the independent variables
(diversity of director resources and the number of
women on the board), and the mediator variables
(KLD CSR ratings) on the dependent variable
(Fortune reputation rating).

Hypothesis 4A predicted that ratings for CSR
would mediate the relationship between the diver-
sity of board resources and corporate reputation.

Following the procedure deﬁned by Baron and
Kenny (1986, 1177), three regression equations are
employed to test mediation:
‘‘ﬁrst, regressing the
mediator on the independent variable;
second,
regressing the dependent variable on the indepen-
dent variable; and third, regressing the dependent
variable on both the independent variable and on the
mediator.’’ In addition ‘‘the effect of the indepen-
dent variable on the dependent variable must be less
in the third step than in the second step’’ (1986,
1177). The ﬁrst regression showed that the inde-
pendent variable, the diversity of board resources,
had no statistically signiﬁcant effect on any of the
mediator variables and consequently hypothesis 4A
was not supported (Table III).

ing the dependent variable on both the independent
variable and the mediators. This step requires that the
relationship between the mediators and the depen-
dent variable be statistically signiﬁcant, and both
institutional strength and technical strengths have a
statistically signiﬁcant impact (p < 0.05) on corporate
reputation (Table IV, models 2a and 2b). Finally,
when all of the above conditions are met, ‘‘then the
effect of the independent variable on the dependent
variable must be less in the third step than in the
second step’’ (Baron and Kenny, 1986, 1177). This is
the case as the number of women on the board was
signiﬁcant in step 2 (p < 0.05) and not signiﬁcant in
step 3 when mediated by institutional
strength
(p = 0.422) or by technical strength (p = 0.196). In
addition,
the standard coefﬁcient declined from
0.279 in step 2 to 0.115 in step 3 when mediated by
institutional strength, and from 0.279 in step 2 to
0.175 in step 3 when mediated by technical strength
(Table IV, models 4a and 4b). These results support
hypothesis 4B, indicating that institutional strength
and technical strength are mediators of the relation-
ship between the number of women on the board
and corporate reputation.

Because of the size of our sample, and the fact that
the conservative Sobel test requires the assumption
of a normal distribution, we used bootstrapping to
further conﬁrm the signiﬁcance of our mediation
ﬁndings (Preacher and Hayes, 2004). We ran 5000
iterations
for bootstrapping purposes. The 99%
conﬁdence interval of the mediation effect of CSR
institutional
strength falls between 0.0328 and
0.4794, and the 99% conﬁdence interval of the
mediation effect of CSR technical strength falls be-
tween 0.0029 and 0.3386. These results conﬁrm the
mediation effects of both institutional and technical
strength at p < 0.01 level.

Discussion and conclusions

Theoretical implications

The motivation for this study was to examine how
the salient
(gender composition) and underlying
(professional backgrounds) diversity among board
directors affect corporate reputation both directly,
and indirectly, through improved CSR.


The Impact of Board Diversity and Gender Composition

217

The study extends current theory by demon-
strating that the number of women on the board has
a positive relationship with the strength ratings for
CSR. Women bring a number of strengths to the
board including an increased sensitivity to CSR
(Williams, 2003) and participative decision-making
styles (Konrad et al., 2008), and these beneﬁts may
contribute to enhanced corporate responsibility
strength ratings. However, as others have argued, the
mere presence of a single female director may not be
sufﬁcient, because minority group members, often
considered tokens, may ﬁnd it more difﬁcult to
voice their opinions and be heard (Brewer and
Kramer, 1985; Kanter, 1977b; Lord and Saenz,
1985; Nemeth, 1986). As the number of women on
a board increases, communication barriers come
down and the minority voice becomes more asser-
tive (Konrad et al., 2008; Kramer et al., 2006) while,
at the same time, the majority is more likely to heed
attention to it (Asch, 1955). Our ﬁndings indicate
that as the number of female directors increases, so
does the ﬁrm’s CSR, suggesting that the contribu-
tions women bring to the board in this area are more
likely to be considered by the board when the group
diversity dynamics move away from tokenism to
normality (Erkut et al., 2008).

The average board size for the companies in the
study was 10.5, with a standard deviation of 2.4, and
a range of 6–17. In an effort to understand how the
effect of having more women might differ on small
or large boards, we conducted a separate analysis in
which we examined how the percentage of women
(relative to board size) affected CSR and reputation.
We found that the percentage of women on the
board was positively associated with corporate rep-
utation. In addition, the hypothesis concerning the
positive relationship between the percentage of
women on the board and CSR was supported for
CSR institutional strength ratings but not for tech-
nical strength ratings. Finally, the hypothesis that
CSR mediates the relationship between the per-
centage of women on the board and reputation was
supported for CSR institutional strength ratings, but
not for technical strength ratings.

The study also conﬁrms the positive impact of
KLD strength ratings for corporate responsibility on
overall reputation, and provides additional support
for the Mattingly and Berman (2006) typology. Both
institutional strength and technical strength ratings

showed a positive relationship with overall corporate
reputation. Institutional strength reﬂects the ﬁrm’s
ability to meet expectations of the community and
diversity stakeholders through philanthropy, com-
munity support, and hiring practices. Technical
strength reﬂects positive exchanges with consumers,
stockholders, and employees through product qual-
ity, good governance, and employee compensation
and beneﬁts. Stakeholders value these strengths as
ﬁrm’s assets because enhancing overall reputation in
these areas translates to a reservoir of goodwill that
can be a tool to partially offset the negative impact of
bad publicity during a crisis (Gardberg and Fomb-
run, 2006; Vanhamme and Grobben, 2009).

institutional

strength and technical

A ﬁnal contribution of the study is the ﬁnding
that
strength
mediate the impact of women on the board on
overall corporate reputation. Women board mem-
bers provide a broad range of contributions
to
boards. This study suggests that they play a role in
enhancing corporate reputation by contributing to
the ﬁrm’s CSR.

The study did not support the hypothesis that an
increased diversity of director resources was posi-
tively associated with CSR strength ratings. It may be
that the focus on health care companies and large
corporate boards is responsible for the results. The
diversity of director resources for these companies
was high with a mean Blau index of 0.617 and
standard deviation of 0.123. Because these companies
are under a high level of public scrutiny most have
chosen boards with diverse resources, and, therefore,
most boards capture the beneﬁts of diversity of
director resources. The issue bears further research.

Managerial and applied implications

The ﬁndings of this research have important impli-
cations for boards and investors. For boards, the
positive impact of gender diversiﬁcation is signiﬁcant
as having more female directors can enhance critical
board processes
including analysis and decision
making. This positive impact of women on boards
can improve ratings for CSR which can, in turn,
enhance corporate reputation and positively impact
ﬁnancial performance, institutional investment, and
share price (Fombrun, 2006). This research provides
investors an additional tool when assessing potential

investments. Because an increase in the number of
women on a board may improve CSR, board
changes may provide important signals to investors
indicating the potential for improved reputation and
ﬁnancial performance.

Increasing the representation of women on boards
continues to be a long process. In 2008, women held
15.2% of board seats at Fortune 500 companies
(Catalyst Census, 2009). Part of the problem is that
women make up only 13.5% of executive ofﬁcers at
Fortune 500 companies
(Catalyst Census, 2009).
Ragins (1998) studied the barriers faced by female
executives, which contributed to the glass ceiling
that prevents women from achieving top executive
positions. She found that female executives identi-
ﬁed ‘‘male stereotyping, exclusion from informal
networks and inhospitable corporate culture,’’ while
male CEOs identiﬁed ‘‘the lack of general man-
agement or line experience and the fact that women
were not in the pipeline long enough’’ (Ragins,
1998, 34–35). Ragins (1998) identiﬁed a number of
key interventions that are needed to break the glass
ceiling: tracking women into line positions, insti-
tuting objective performance appraisal
systems,
mentoring and intervention by the CEO. Of addi-
tional concern are ﬁndings by Poff and Hamill
(2008) who showed that there is a disproportionately
low representation of female students in graduate
programs of the one hundred top business schools.
Such trends will continue to lead to a smaller pool of
eligible female candidates for top team and board
positions. Clearly,
are
needed to develop women executives and future
board members, who seem poised to enhance cor-
porate reputation and ﬁrm performance.

system-wide adjustments

The study did not ﬁnd diversity of director re-
sources
to be directly associated with corporate
reputation. This does not diminish the importance
of director resource diversity as most of the ﬁrms in
the study had boards with diverse representation of
insiders, business experts, support specialists, and
community inﬂuentials.

Limitations and future research

Limitations of this study should be acknowledged.
They also provide opportunities for future research.
The study sample was composed of large ﬁrms in the

health care industry which limits the generalizability
of results. Health care was chosen because companies
in this industry group have generally faced a chal-
lenging public relations environment due to the
public’s negative reaction to rising health care costs.
As such, these companies and their boards may be
more proactive in managing their reputations to en-
hance stakeholder relations. In addition, with the use
of a single industry data set, the internal validity of the
study was enhanced. Nevertheless,
future studies
should examine additional industries. Also, since the
data in this study were drawn from the Fortune survey
of corporate reputation, the companies studied are the
largest in each industry group. By choosing a different
source of corporate reputation, future research can be
expanded to examine smaller ﬁrms.

Another provocative area for future research is
how board processes change as the number of women
increases. In 2008, 90% of Fortune 500 companies
had at least one woman on the board, but under 20%
had three or more (Catalyst Census, 2009). Research
should explore how board processes including in-
quiry, decision making, and social cohesion evolve as
the number of women increase. This research could
provide additional support for further increasing the
number of women on boards. It might also offer
guidance for ways to maximize the effectiveness of
women or other minorities when their presence on
the board is limited to one or two members.
