 Conflicts in the Work Family
 Interface: Links to Job Stress,
 Customer Service Employee
 Performance, and Customer

 Purchase Intent

 Because customer service employees often represent the sole contact a customer has with a firm, it is important
 to examine job-related factors that affect customer service employee performance and customer evaluations. In
 two diverse customer settings, the authors capture matched responses from service employees, supervisors, and
 customers. The authors use the data to examine the potential chain of effects from customer service employee
 work-family conflict and family-work conflict, to job stress and job performance, to customer purchase intent
 (CPI). The results show direct (and indirect) effects of work-family conflict and family-work conflict on service
 employee customer-directed extra-role performance (CDERP). The results also show direct effects of job stress
 on service employee in-role performance (IRP) and CDERP and on CPI. Furthermore, the findings show that job
 stress has a more pronounced effect on IRP than on CDERP and that CDERP has a greater effect on CPI than
 does IRP. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial and theoretical implications.

 In recent years, the changing workforce (e.g., more dual

 career couples) and the nature of work itself (e.g., an
 increase in the number of service sector jobs) have given
 rise to conflicts in the work-family interface that may affect
 the work performance of employees and organizations (De
 Jonge and Dormann 2003). The conflicts may have their
 most pronounced effects in the stressful environment of
 customer service jobs. Customer service employees may
 take their jobs home with them, creating work-family con-
 flicts (WFCs) that lead to additional stress at work, thus
 affecting their performance and customers' evaluations.
 Indeed, recent reports suggest that conflicts in the work-
 family interface lead to job stress, which in turn seriously
 impairs service employee performance (Molpus 2003;
 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
 2002). Two stressors in this interface are WFC and family-
 work conflict (FWC); the former is a form of interrole con-
 flict in which the demands created by the job interfere with
 the performance of family-related responsibilities, and the
 latter is a form of interrole conflict in which the demands
 created by the family interfere with the performance of

 work-related responsibilities (Netemeyer, Boles, and
 McMurrian 1996). As with most WFC and FWC conceptu-
 alizations, our concepts view family as a larger, nonwork
 entity that includes responsibilities toward spouses, chil-
 dren, nonmarried partners, and home life in general
 (Adams, King, and King 1996; Frone 2000; Frone, Russell,
 and Cooper 1992).

 To date, there is primarily anecdotal evidence of the
 effects of WFC and FWC on employee performance and
 customer outcomes. For example, USA Today reports that
 32% of employees indicated that balancing work and family
 demands was their leading job-related concern (Armour
 2002). Likewise, a Financial Times article notes that despite
 the best managerial support, the home demands of customer
 service employees may permeate their work lives and nega-
 tively affect their job performance (Furnham 2002). Given
 that customer service employees are highly stressed and
 struggle to balance the demands of several parties, it is
 important to examine the potential chain of effects from
 WFC and FWC, to job stress, to performance, and, ulti-
 mately, to customer purchase intent (CPI). Furthermore,
 because service employees often need to go beyond their in-
 role performance (IRP) to help customers, research must
 explore how the work-family interface affects customer-
 directed extra-role performance (CDERP) and customer
 evaluations.

 Our research examines three questions pertaining to the
 potential chain of effects from WFC and FWC to CPI. First,
 how do WFC and FWC affect customer service employee
 performances? Are their effects mediated by job stress, or
 are they direct? Second, what is the effect of job stress on
 customer purchase intent? Third, what are the relative

 effects of WFC, FWC, and job stress on service employee
 performances? We collect multisource data in two settings
 (one business-to-consumer and one business-to-business) to
 address these questions.

 Overview and Hypotheses

 Overview of Models

 Figure 1 presents two models of the relationships among
 WFC, FWC, job stress, service employee IRP, service
 employee CDERP, and CPI. Although many frameworks

 have been proposed for studying the work-family interface,
 our models are derived from three mostly complementary
 theoretical perspectives: (1) interrole conflict theory (Kahn
 and Byosiere 1992), (2) identity theory (Thoits 1991), and
 (3) conservation of resources (COR)/resource drain theory
 (Hobfoll 2002). The three theories share the common
 premise that WFC, FWC, and job stress compete for or tax
 the employee resources of time, cognitive effort, and emo-
 tional and psychological energy.

 The mediated model in Figure 1, Panel A, posits that the
 effects of WFC and FWC on CDERP are mediated by job

 stress, and the effect of job stress on CPI is mediated by the
 two performance constructs (i.e., IRP and CDERP). This
 model is consistent with the more traditional approaches of
 how job stressors (i.e., WFC and FWC) and job stress affect
 performance and customer outcomes (Beehr 2000; Kahn
 and Byosiere 1992); that is, job stress is an affective media-
 tor of the effects of WFC and FWC on performance, and
 performance is a behavioral mediator of the effect of job
 stress on CPI. The incremental effects model in Figure 1,
 Panel B, posits that FWC and WFC directly affect CDERP
 beyond their effects on job stress, and job stress directly
 affects CPI beyond the effects of the performance variables.
 We compare the mediated and incremental effects models
 with the premise that the incremental direct effects of WFC
 and FWC on CDERP and of job stress on CPI are tenable.

 tinguish between IRP and CDERP. At least three customer-
 linking behaviors of service employees have been identified
 (Bettencourt and Brown 2003). First, service employees can
 enhance their firm's image by advocating the firm's prod-
 ucts and services to third parties (i.e., customers). Second,
 service employees are in a position to unveil customer
 wants, needs, and expectations that can be communicated to
 the firm to serve customers better. Third, customer evalua-
 tions are contingent on the service employees with whom
 the customer interacts. Such high-quality interaction
 enhances a firm's customer evaluations. These customer-
 linking behaviors can help retain current customers and
 attract new customers through favorable word of mouth
 from current customers. Embedded in these behaviors are
 IRP and CDERP.

 Our conceptualization of IRP is consistent with three

 and family. Thus, WFC leads to job stress because
 resources are lost in the process of juggling both work and
 family, creating elevated levels of stress at work (Hobfoll
 2002).

 mance in the customer service setting, CDERP. Borman and

 the work role. This undermines a person's work-role iden-
 tity, increasing job stress. Scholars suggest that such an
 effect represents a spillover in which the demands of one
 role exacerbate the stress in another role (Edwards and
 Rothbard 2000).

 Effects of job stress on performance. It is widely
 accepted that the customer service job is stressful (De Jonge
 and Dormann 2003), and it follows that job stress can hin-
 der an employee's IRP. First, customer service employees
 typically believe that they lack control over their jobs and
 that they have the onerous task of satisfying conflicting
 demands of customers and managers. To magnify these
 issues, technology improvements have enabled service
 employees to handle more customer inquiries per hour, and
 employees rarely know the pace or nature of their work
 ahead of time (Schneider and Bowen 1995; Slepicka 2000).

 These factors contribute to job stress, detracting from the
 time that is necessary for such IRP tasks as record keeping
 and staying abreast of product knowledge. Second, job
 stress disrupts employees' ability to perform prescribed
 tasks, because it also strips them of the energy resources
 that are necessary to perform (Hobfoll 2002). Thus, we
 expect job stress to negatively affect IRP.

 We also expect job stress to affect CDERP. Because IRP
 requires formal reporting that is expected by management,
 some portion of a service employee's resources is likely
 devoted to IRP, leaving fewer resources to engage in
 CDERP. This notion is consistent with the COR/resource
 drain view, and job stress theorists note that an indication of
 elevated job stress is when employees stop engaging in
 CDERPs (Jex 1998). In addition, frontline employees may
 "disengage" from performing CDERPs, because job stress
 drains the types of emotional and cognitive resources
 (patience, empathy) that are necessary to offer stirring per-
 formances during the employee-customer interface (De
 Jonge and Dormann 2003; Kahn 1990).

 that conflict in one domain reduces the personal capability
 to meet demands in the other domain, thereby inhibiting
 role performance in the other domain. They suggest that
 such an effect is direct, as well as indirect, through a medi-
 ating mechanism such as mental/physical health (i.e., job
 stress). Identity theory further contends that competing
 salient roles (family and work) potentially have a spillover
 effect, implying that work that interferes with family may
 affect CDERP. Finally, in his conceptualization of being
 personally disengaged from work, Kahn (1990) suggests
 that conflict in the work-family interface directly affects
 performance, particularly in service-related jobs. He sug-
 gests that employees may withdraw from a work role
 because resources that are necessary for that role (i.e.,
 patience, understanding, and cognitive effort endemic to
 CDERP) are the same resources that are devoted to an out-
 side role (family).

 Effects of performance on CPI. Perhaps no other cus-

 tomer outcome is a better indicator of loyalty than the intent
 to purchase again from a firm (Oliver 1997). Service
 employee performance may play a key role in influencing
 such intent. For example, service employee role-prescribed
 behavior has been found to affect customer satisfaction and
 loyalty (Bettencourt and Brown 1997). Furthermore,
 CDERPs, as rated by customers, have been found to posi-
 tively affect customer perceptions of justice in a complaint-
 handling setting (Maxham and Netemeyer 2003). Concep-
 tual writings also suggest that CDERP "delights" customers
 and enhances their intent to repurchase (Schneider and
 Bowen 1999).

 H3: Both (a) IRP and (b) CDERP positively affect CPI.

 Incremental Effects Model

 FWC and WFC effects on CDERP. Although we expect

 that job stress is the primary predictor of IRP and CDERP,
 we also expect that FWC and WFC explain incremental
 variance in CDERP beyond that which is explained by job
 stress. Boundary spanners, such as customer service
 employees, must balance the demands of groups internal
 (supervisor, customers) and external (family) to the job.
 Compartmentalizing the cognitive and emotional resources
 that are necessary to fulfill the demands is difficult, nega-
 tively affecting certain aspects of performance, namely,
 CDERP. Furthermore, effective CDERP requires employees
 to engage customers, patiently listen to their concerns, and
 quickly develop suitable resolutions. Employees might not
 be able to perform these critical work roles effectively when
 they are expending considerable cognitive and emotional
 resources to resolve conflicts with their lives outside of
 their jobs (Kahn 1990). As such, employees may disengage
 from performing, and we posit that FWC negatively (and
 incrementally) affects CDERP.

 We also contend that WFC has an incremental direct

 effect on CDERP. Edwards and Rothbard (2000) suggest

 effects of employee performances, job stress incrementally
 affects CPI. Our rationale is as follows: First, although
 employees are believed to self-regulate by trying to con-
 serve resources that are necessary to perform their jobs, the
 resources are quickly depleted when the job situation is
 stressful (Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister 1998). In cus-
 tomer service settings, there is a heightened potential for
 contentiousness between service employees and customers,
 as customers impose a variety of cognitive, emotional, and
 behavioral demands on service employees that may lower
 overall customer evaluations (De Jonge and Dormann
 2003).

 Second, customers are likely to detect the manifesta-
 tions of job stress in the forms of poor decision making,
 lack of self-control, carelessness, or inhospitable looks. In
 effect, this lowers the ability to generate CPI, because ser-
 vice employees who experience job stress may not provide
 quality interactions with customers. Such a process concurs
 with Kahn's (1990) view of disengagement in critical
 moments of the work role. Specifically, job stress may
 directly affect CPI by inhibiting the service employee from
 offering a stirring role performance when interacting with
 customers. Customers may sense this and give low CPI rat-
 ings. Finally, there are anecdotal writings that suggest that
 when employees experience less job stress, customers rate
 the service they receive more favorably, creating positive
 customer evaluations (Furnham 2002; Schneider and
 Bowen 1999).

 H5: Beyond the positive effects of the performance constructs
 on CPI, job stress has an incremental negative effect on
 CPI.

 Relative Effects of WFC, FWC, Job Stress, and
 Performance

 WFC versus FWC and their effects on CDERP. It is

 important to understand whether FWC or WFC has a more
 detrimental effect on CDERP. Conventional wisdom and
 interrole conflict theory suggest that FWC should have a

 greater effect. That is, FWC reflects the degree to which the
 family role interferes with performing work-related tasks,
 whereas WFC reflects the degree to which the job role
 interferes with performing family-related tasks. Interrole
 conflict theory further suggests that negative behavioral
 outcomes are more likely experienced in the domain to
 which the source of the conflict is directed (i.e., family
 interfering with work) (Netemeyer, Boles, and McMurrian
 1996). Finally, the employee resources that are necessary to
 fulfill the family role (patience, understanding, and empa-
 thy) are the same resources that are endemic to CDERP. As
 the family role depletes the resources, less of the resource is
 available for CDERP. Thus, we expect that FWC has a
 stronger effect on CDERP than does WFC.

 H6: The effect of FWC on CDERP is stronger than the effect

 of WFC on CDERP.

 Job stress and its effect on IRP versus CDERP. Does
 job stress have a stronger effect on IRP or on CDERP? Con-
 sidering the type of extra-role performance that we exam-
 ine, we believe that job stress has a stronger effect on IRP.
 Identity theory suggests that the strength of identification
 with a role dictates the resources that are applied to the role.
 This tenet also holds for a role within a given role (IRP ver-
 sus CDERP within the overall work role) (Rothbard and
 Edwards 2003). Specifically, the goals of the firm are at the
 core of an employee's work-role investment. In a customer
 service context, a firm's goal is to maximize customer loy-
 alty, and employees may allow job stress to affect IRP more
 than CDERP because they identify more strongly with the
 CDERP aspect of the work. In addition, consistent with the
 attraction-selection-attrition framework (Schneider, Gold-
 stein, and Smith 1995) and Bitner, Booms, and Mohr's
 (1994) work, boundary spanners are attracted to their posi-
 tions because they possess the characteristics and the desire
 to provide good service. Finally, in our samples, the service
 employees went through extensive selection, training, and
 socialization processes. These processes emphasized the
 goal of customer retention by "going the extra mile" and
 "taking ownership" of a customer's problem. On the basis
 of this rationale, we expect that IRP suffers more at the
 hands of job stress than does CDERP.

 H7: Job stress has a stronger effect on IRP than on CDERP.

 Second, customers tend to recall encounters that are
 vivid or distinct, such as those involved in our customer
 complaint settings (Price, Arnould, and Tierney 1995). Fur-
 thermore, given that CDERPs are discretionary, customers
 may view the behaviors as internal to the customer service
 employee with whom they dealt. Similar to the cognitive
 processes that underlie managers' performance ratings of
 employees, customers may attribute CDERPs as stable and
 internal to the employee (i.e., "this person is giving great
 service because he or she wants to, not because he or she
 has to"). Such CDERPs are likely to be retained in memory
 and recalled in deriving final evaluations (i.e., CPI) (e.g.,
 MacKenzie, Podsakoff, and Fetter 1993). Thus, CDERP
 should have a greater effect on CPI than does IRP.

 Finally, service employees are hired to handle customer
 issues, and in managers' communication to employees (as
 in our samples that follow), they reiterate that in-role job
 duties are primarily tools that may help employees solve
 customer problems. It is also strongly stressed to employees
 that they must "see the big picture" of the organizational
 goal of retaining customers by solving customer problems.
 It would seem that CDERP is more instrumental to that goal
 than is IRP.

 Hg: CDERP has a stronger effect on CPI than does IRP.

 Study Methods
 Sample 1: Procedures and Measures

 Procedures. With our first sample, we gathered data
 from customers, customer service employees, and supervi-
 sors of an online electronics retailer (i.e., a business-to-
 consumer setting). Customers initiated contact with the firm
 by telephoning the customer service center, which routed
 them to a service employee. (The primary responsibility of
 each employee was to handle customer complaints.) The
 employee logged a "job problem report" into the customer
 database and then attempted to resolve the complaint. All
 customer queries appeared in a complaint register, which
 was closely monitored by service employee supervisors.
 After exhausting all efforts to resolve a complaint, customer
 service employees "closed out" the job problem report in
 the customer database and noted the event history in the
 buyer's profile.

 CDERP versus IRP and their effects on CDERP. We
 posit that CDERP has a stronger effect on CPI than on IRP
 for three reasons. First, customers are more likely to wit-
 ness extra-role behaviors. Given that many IRPs are not
 seen or do not resonate with customers unless they are
 exceptionally good or poor, it seems reasonable that the
 effect of IRP is not as strong as that of CDERP. Further-
 more, because extra-role behaviors go "beyond the call of
 duty," these behaviors are more likely to strike a chord with
 customers and resonate with them over time. This notion is
 consistent with the writings of Bitner, Booms, and Tetreault
 (1990). In their analysis of critical customer service inci-
 dents, they report that "extraordinary" service employee
 behaviors, such as courtesy and thoughtfulness, translated
 into customers' experiencing high levels of satisfaction and
 remembering the service encounter.

 Customer measures. Our data-collection process began

 with customers. A total of 700 surveys were e-mailed to
 customers after they experienced a customer service inter-
 action. Of the 700 e-mailed surveys, 346 were returned, of
 which 320 had complete responses across all study vari-
 ables, yielding a 45.7% customer response rate. Within the
 six-month study period, each of the 320 customers dealt
 exclusively with only one service employee, and in all
 cases, the complaint that the customers registered was their
 first ever with the firm.

 After the customer's most recent service experience
 with the firm and its employee, customers rated three CPI
 items on a seven-point scale, ranging from "not likely" to
 "very likely." Given that customer satisfaction is commonly
 viewed as an antecedent of CPI, we created a measure of
 satisfaction based on the complaint/service request we

 described previously. We used the measure as a control vari-
 able to estimate all models that follow. In total, 60% of the
 sample was male, 69% had been customers for two to four
 years, 51% reported incomes from $40,000 to $60,000, and
 74% held college degrees.

 Employee measures. After a customer service inquiry
 was closed out, an e-mail containing a survey was sent to
 the service employee who handled the complaint. Surveys
 were sent to 700 service employees who specifically han-
 dled the 700 customer-initiated complaints. Of the surveys
 sent to customer service employees, 621 usable responses
 were returned, yielding an 88.7% response rate. In total,
 320 surveys were matched to the fully completed customer
 survey, yielding a 45.7% response rate. That is, 320 service
 employee surveys were matched to the specific customer
 survey that represented the customer whom they had
 served. Thus, all analyses involving Sample 1 use a sample
 of 320 customer-employee response pairs.

 The survey asked employees about their perceptions of

 the focal constructs (i.e., WFC, FWC, and job stress) over
 the past six months. We measured WFC and FWC with
 three items from the scales that Netemeyer, Boles, and
 McMurrian (1996) developed. We measured job stress with
 three items from the anxiety-stress scale that House and
 Rizzo (1972) developed and with one item that we gener-
 ated. We also gathered two other measures from service
 employees. Job satisfaction and affective organizational
 commitment (OC) have been shown to be potential out-
 comes of WFC, FWC, and job stress and to be potential
 antecedents and/or outcomes of IRP and CDERP (MacKen-
 zie, Podsakoff, and Ahearne 1998; Podsakoff et al. 2000).
 We used a three-item measure of job satisfaction and a four-
 item measure of OC (Mowday, Steers, and Porter 1979),
 and we used these measures as control variables to estimate
 all models that follow. All items were rated on a seven-point
 scale, ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree."
 All employees were full time, 53% were female, 82% had
 been employees for five years or fewer, 81% reported
 incomes from $40,000 to $70,000, and 67% held college
 degrees.

 the company." We measured CDERP with four items that
 we adapted from Bettencourt and Brown's (1997) work; the
 items were rated on a seven-point scale, ranging from
 "never" to "as often as possible." We used supervisor-rated
 measures of employee performance for several reasons.
 First, employees may overrate their performance (Murphy
 and Cleveland 1995). Second, evidence suggests that as pre-
 dictors of a criterion variable other than that rated by
 employees or supervisors, supervisor-rated measures of
 employee performance have the stronger predictive validity
 (Atkins and Wood 2002). Other scholars also suggest that
 supervisor-rated measures of employee performance are
 more valid than are employee self-ratings (Scullen, Mount,
 and Goff 2000). Finally, we used a supervisor-rated mea-
 sure of employee performance because customers rated the
 prime dependent variable of interest, CPI. Thus, the links
 between the performance constructs and CPI are free of
 same-source bias (Podsakoff et al. 2003). Of the supervi-
 sors, 60% were female, 80% had been with the firm for
 eight years or more, 77% reported incomes from $55,000 to
 $70,000, and 57% held college degrees (the Appendix
 shows the measures for the focal constructs of our studies
 [i.e., CPI, WFC, FWC, job stress, IRP, and CDERP]).1

 Sample 2: Procedures and Measures

 Procedures. Our second sample used 132 customers,
 service employees, and supervisors of a manufacturer/seller
 of technology-related equipment for retailers and financial
 service institutions (i.e., business-to-business setting). Cus-
 tomers initiated a call to the service employee, who person-
 ally visited the customer's site and tried to resolve a prob-
 lem that the customer was having with equipment
 purchased from the manufacturer. The majority of com-
 plaints involved software/hardware malfunctions, and
 supervisors often accompanied service employees. We used
 the exact same data-collection procedures as we did for
 Sample 1.

 Customer measures. Surveys were e-mailed to cus-
 tomers after they experienced a customer service interac-
 tion. Of the 200 surveys that were sent, 132 were returned

 Supervisor measures. The 53 supervisors who managed
 the 320 employees were also sent e-mailed surveys, and all
 53 participated. The supervisors managed an average of six
 service employees and rated their performance for the six-
 month study period. The supervisor surveys were returned
 and were matched to the respective employees whom they
 rated. Given that supervisors rated more than one employee,
 we created a partially nested design between employees and
 supervisors. In addition to estimating our structural equa-
 tion models (see Figure 1), we estimated a set of linear
 mixed models that control for any random effects of the
 supervisors' repeated measurements on the parameter esti-
 mates that involve the supervisor-employee pairs (H2-H3).
 For both samples, there was no significant across- or
 within-supervisor rating biases due to evaluating multiple
 employees within a workgroup.

 We measured employees' IRP with three items that we
 adapted from Singh Verbeke, and Rhoads's (1996) work;
 the items were rated on a seven-point scale, ranging from
 "among the worst in the company" to "among the best in

 1Three measurement issues are of note. First, we began with 23
 employee-rated items. Using confirmatory factor analyses and our
 own judgment, we trimmed this pool to 17 items (3 WFC, 3 FWC,
 4 job stress, 3 job satisfaction, and 4 OC). We began with 9
 supervisor- and 6 customer-rated items. Using confirmatory factor
 analyses, we retained 7 supervisor items and 6 customer items.
 Second, because we are linking performance measures that span a
 six-month period to a specific customer's purchase intents, we
 assume that performance is stable over time. There is some evi-
 dence to support this assumption; Viswesvaran, Ones, and Schmidt
 (1996) report a meta-analytic correlation of .81 for supervisor rat-
 ings of employee performance over two time periods. The strength
 of the correlation is indicative of stable performance over time.
 Third, although the performance-CPI links are free of same-
 source bias, WFC, FWC, and job stress items were rated by the
 same source. We compared the path estimates of a same-source
 methods factor model to the path estimates from a model without
 the same-source factor (Williams and Anderson 1994). We found
 that the path estimates were somewhat attenuated when the same-
 source factor was present, but the path estimates were not signifi-
 cantly affected.

 with complete responses across the same customer mea-
 sures that we used in Sample 1 (a 66% customer response
 rate). The 132 customer respondents dealt specifically and
 exclusively with one of the 132 service employees over the
 six-month study period. These customers were responsible
 for the purchasing and day-to-day functioning of the techni-
 cal equipment used in their firms. In total, 67% of the cus-
 tomers were female, and 82% held college degrees.

 Employee measures. After the customer service
 inquiries were resolved, a survey was e-mailed to the 200
 service employees who specifically handled the 200
 customer-initiated complaints. Of the surveys sent, 185
 responses were returned, yielding a 92.5% employee
 response rate. Of these, 132 surveys were matched to the
 completed customer survey, yielding a 66% matched
 response rate. Thus, all analyses for Sample 2 use a sample
 of 132 customer-employee response pairs. The employees
 completed the same measures that we reported in Sample 1.
 All employees were full time, 67% were female, 82% had
 been employees for three years or fewer, 72% reported
 incomes from $50,000 to $70,000, and 87% held college
 degrees.

 Supervisor measures. The 27 supervisors who managed
 the 132 employees were also sent e-mailed surveys. Each
 supervisor managed an average of five employees and rated
 the employees for the six-month study period over the same
 performance measures that we used in Sample 1. The super-
 visor surveys were matched to the respective service
 employee survey. In total, 42% of the supervisors were
 female, 60% had been employees for six years or more,
 78% reported incomes from $50,000 to $70,000, and 65%
 held college degrees.2

 Measurement Checks

 Discriminant validity and reliability. We examined the
 psychometric properties of our measures by estimating a
 30-item, 9-factor (WFC, FWC, job stress, job satisfaction,
 OC, IRP, CDERP, CPI, and customer satisfaction) measure-
 ment model. This model fit the data well for Sample 1 (x2 =
 882.35, degrees of freedom [d.f.] = 369; comparative fit
 index [CFI] = .94; nonnormed fit index [NNFI] = .93; and
 root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .06)
 and for Sample 2 (x2 = 592.29, d.f. = 369; CFI = .93;
 NNFI = .92; and RMSEA = .06) (Hu and Bentler 1995).
 Tables 1 and 2 show summary statistics, internal consis-
 tency estimates, and correlations for Samples 1 and 2,
 respectively. Coefficient alpha estimates of internal consis-
 tency ranged from .61 to .95, and average variance esti-
 mates (AVE) ranged from .30 to .87. The disattenuated cor-
 relations among the constructs (To estimates) ranged from
 -.79 (job stress and IRP) to .72 (IRP and CDERP). We
 examined discriminant validity among the constructs by
 comparing cp to AVE. If the square of the parameter esti-
 mate between two constructs ((p2) is less than the average
 AVE between the two constructs, discriminant validity is
 supported (Fornell and Larcker 1981). This criterion was
 met for all possible pairs of constructs in Tables 1 and 2.

 Multigroup measurement invariance. We also tested
 whether the measures were invariant across samples by esti-
 mating a hierarchy of multigroup measurement invariance
 models (Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1998). The first
 model that we estimated was a baseline measurement model
 of the same pattern of fixed and free parameters. This
 model fit the data well (x2 = 1474.64, d.f. = 738; CFI = .94;

 2We conducted several sample bias checks. For both samples,
 we compared the demographic characteristics of our employee,
 supervisor, and customer samples with several other samples that
 did not participate in our study. We found no significant differ-
 ences between our samples and the other samples across demo-

 graphics. We also assessed potential effects of employee gender,
 age, and education. As predictors or moderators of WFC and
 FWC, these variables had no effects. For Sample 2 (n = 132), we
 assessed whether marital status and having child dependents
 affected the results. These variables had no effects as either pre-
 dictors or moderators of WFC and FWC.

 NNFI = .93; and RMSEA = .06). Next, we estimated a
 model that constrained the factor loadings to be invariant
 across groups. The fit indices for this model were accept-
 able (x2 = 1491.11, d.f. = 759; CFI = .94; NNFI = .93; and
 RMSEA = .06), and the difference in fit between this model
 and the baseline measurement model was not significant
 (x2diff = 16.47, d.f.diff = 21, p > 10). Thus, the loadings for
 all measurement items were invariant across samples. The
 third model that we estimated specified invariant factor
 variances and covariances in addition to invariant factor
 loadings. It had acceptable fit indices (x2 = 1510.29, d.f. =
 804; CFI = .94; NNFI = .93; and RMSEA = .06), and the
 difference in fit between this model and the baseline mea-
 surement model was not significant (X2diff = 35.65, d.f.diff =
 66, p > 10). Thus, all correlational (covariance) relations
 among model constructs, as well as construct (factor) vari-
 ances, were equal across samples. Finally, we estimated a
 fully invariant measurement model (i.e., invariant factor
 loadings, invariant factor variances and covariances, and
 invariant item error loadings). Although the indices showed
 adequate fit (X2 = 1659.54, d.f. = 834; CFI = .93; NNFI =
 .93; and RMSEA = .07), this model's fit differed from the
 fit of the baseline measurement model (X2diff = 184.90,
 d.f.diff = 96, p < .01). Still, the invariance of the factor load-
 ings, factor variances, and covariances suggests that corn-
 paring model paths across samples is appropriate.

 across samples. If structural invariance exists, hypothesized
 paths can be tested with the multigroup approach.

 Mediated model. We first used this approach for the
 mediated model that appears in Figure 1. As we previously
 noted, we measured three control variables: service
 employee job satisfaction, OC, and customer satisfaction.
 As is the recent trend in structural equation models to con-
 trol for variables that are not central to study hypotheses
 (Baltes and Heydens-Gahir 2003; Rothbard and Edwards
 2003), we also estimated paths among the control variables
 and the focal constructs (prior research suggests 14 paths
 among the focal constructs and control variables; Podsakoff
 et al. 2000; Oliver 1997). Thus, for all structural models
 that follow, the paths among the focal constructs ("Hypoth-
 esized Paths" in Table 3) reflect the effects of simultane-
 ously estimating paths among the focal constructs and con-
 trol variables ("Control Variable Paths" in Table 3).

 The baseline structural model of freely estimated paths

 across samples demonstrated fit levels approaching ade-
 quacy (x2 = 2082.60, d.f. = 768; CFI = .89; NNFI = .88; and
 RMSEA = .08), as did the full structural invariance model
 (x2 = 2089.83, d.f. = 788; CFI = .89; NNFI = .88; and
 RMSEA = .08). Given that the difference in fit between the
 two models was not significant (X2diff = 7.23, d.f.diff = 20,
 p > .10), all paths are equal across groups, and we offer the
 results for the mediated model based on full structural
 invariance.

 Analyses and Results
 Structural Model Procedures and Results
 To test the structural models, we used a multiple-group
 approach akin to the method that Singh (2000) uses. With
 this approach, we estimated two multigroup models. The
 first model freely estimates all paths across samples (i.e.,
 the baseline structural model). The model is then compared
 with a model in which all paths are constrained to be equal
 across samples (i.e., a full structural invariance model). If
 the difference in fit between the two models is not signifi-
 cant, there is evidence that all structural paths are invariant

 We predicted that WFC and FWC would affect (pro-
 duce) job stress (H1). As we show in Table 3, the WFC ->
 job stress path was significant and positive, in support of
 Hi a. Although correlated with job stress (cp = .41 and .46
 from Tables 1 and 2), the FWC --> job stress path was not
 significant, likely because of the shared variance between
 WFC and FWC. Still, the WFC and FWC paths explained
 45% of the variance in job stress. H2 posits direct effects of
 job stress on IRP and CDERP. As we show in Table 3, both
 hypotheses were supported, explaining large portions of the
 variance in IRP (R2 = .64) and CDERP (R2 = .57). Finally,
 H3 of the mediated model predicts that both IRP and

 CDERP positively affect CPI. Both paths were supported,
 explaining 53% of the variance in CPI.

 Incremental effects model. H4 posits that both FWC and
 WFC incrementally affect CDERP (i.e., job stress does not
 fully mediate the WFC/FWC effects on CDERP). H5 posits
 a direct effect of job stress on CPI-that is, job stress
 explains incremental variance in CPI beyond that which
 IRP and CDERP explain. To test the hypotheses, we added
 paths from FWC and WFC to CDERP and a path from job
 stress, to CPI, to the mediated model to create the incre-
 mental effects model. Again, we used a multigroup model
 approach in which the baseline structural model of freely
 estimated paths across samples showed adequate fit (x2 =
 1875.85, d.f. = 762; CFI = .90; NNFI = .89; and RMSEA =
 .07). The full structural invariance model also fit well (x2 =

 1884.80, d.f. = 785; CFI = .91; NNFI = .90; and RMSEA =
 .07), and its difference in fit from the baseline structural
 model was not significant (X2diff = 8.95, d.f.diff = 23, p >
 .10), again suggesting that all paths are equal across groups.
 Thus, in Table 3, we offer the results for the incremental
 effects model based on full structural invariance.

 Consistent with the writings on mediation (lacobucci
 and Duhachek 2003), we first compared the incremental
 effects model to the mediated model. The difference in fit
 between the two models was significant (x2diff = 205.03,
 d.f.diff = 3, p < .01), suggesting that job stress does not
 totally mediate the effects of FWC and WFC on CDERP
 and that IRP and CDERP do not totally mediate the effect
 of job stress on CPI. The path estimates in Table 3 reinforce
 this conclusion. The FWC --> CDERP and WFC -> CDERP

 paths were significant, and they explained an additional
 12% of the variance in CDERP beyond that explained by
 job stress in the mediated model. The job stress CPI path
 was also strong, and it explained an additional 16% of the
 variance in CPI beyond that explained by IRP and CDERP
 in the mediated model.

 Relative Effects of WFC, FWC, Job Stress, and
 Performance

 Discussion

 Summary of Key Findings

 Effects of WFC and FWC. Both FWC and WFC had
 negative incremental effects on CDERP. Thus, their effects
 on CDERP were not totally mediated by job stress. Further-
 more, WFC showed strong indirect effects on IRP, CDERP,
 and CPI.

 By employing multigroup analyses with the full structural
 invariance incremental effects model, we tested our relative
 effects hypotheses. We tested each hypothesis with a chi-
 square difference test at 1 d.f. in which the two paths are
 constrained to be equal in one model but are freely esti-
 mated in another. We show the results in Table 4. Although
 H6 posits that the direct effect of FWC on CDERP is
 stronger than the direct effect of WFC, the hypothesis was
 not supported. Both FWC and WFC equally affected
 CDERP. We tested H7 by comparing the job stress --> IRP
 path to the job stress --> CDERP path, and we found that job
 stress had a greater effect on IRP than on CDERP. Finally,
 H8 was supported because CDERP had a stronger direct
 effect on CPI than did IRP.

 Indirect and Total Effects of WFC and FWC

 As we noted previously, WFC had strong direct effects on
 job stress and CDERP, and FWC had a direct effect on
 CDERP. Although not hypothesized, WFC and FWC
 showed a series of important indirect and total effects as
 well. Indirect effects are those that are mediated by at least
 one other variable, and total effects are the sum of the direct
 (e.g., WFC -> CDERP) and indirect (e.g., WFC -> job
 stress -3 CDERP) effects (Bollen 1989). The indirect effect
 of WFC on CDERP through job stress was significant
 (unstandardized indirect path = -.31, standardized indirect
 path = -.29; t = 6.97, p < .01), as was the total effect of
 WFC on CDERP (unstandardized total effect = -.65, stan-
 dardized total effect = -.69; t = 11.41, p < .01). The indirect
 effects of WFC on IRP (unstandardized indirect path =
 -.59, standardized indirect path = -.49; t = 9.67, p < .01)
 and CPI (unstandardized indirect path = -.48, standardized
 indirect path = -.51; t = 10.18, p < .01) were also signifi-
 cant. Although FWC did not show a direct effect on job
 stress, it showed a direct effect on CDERP and had one total
 effect. The FWC total effect on CDERP was significant
 (unstandardized total effect = -.18, standardized total
 effect = -.13; t = 2.62, p < .01).

 Effects of job stress and performance. Job stress
 affected both aspects of performance, and job stress was
 more strongly related to IRP than to CDERP. Both IRP and
 CDERP affected CPI in the mediated model. However, job
 stress had a strong negative incremental effect on CPI that
 was not totally mediated by the positive effects of perfor-
 mance. Finally, CDERP had a stronger effect on CPI than
 did IRP.

 Managerial Implications
 Our results have important managerial implications. How-
 ever, to be beneficial, all the initiatives and programs that
 we subsequently discuss require a real cultural shift in the
 way an organization views its employees. First, managers
 should be trained to regard their employees as family mem-
 bers, with all the issues and responsibilities that go with it,
 and they must understand that service employees do not
 leave family problems at the workplace doorstep (Rifkin
 1996). Thus, just as service employees are asked to "take
 ownership" of customer problems, supervisors and man-
 agers may need to take at least some ownership of
 employee problems that stem from the work-family inter-
 face. Managers who take the attitude that "it's not my prob-
 lem" may effectively be hurting the organizational goal of
 customer retention. Although training programs to teach
 managers these skills may seem like an obvious solution,
 many firms do not implement them because of the costs
 involved. One study reports that fewer than half (43%) of
 firms currently train managers to respond to the work-
 family needs of employees (Galinsky and Bond 1998). Our
 results provide some evidence that not training managers to
 deal with service employee job stress and its WFC and
 FWC antecedents may also carry a high cost.

 Second, managers can structure the workplace so that
 employees are encouraged to balance work and family.
 Managers can implement family-friendly programs that
 send signals that management supports family roles. Some
 popular programs that members of Fortune's "100 Best

 (Lobel 1999), enhance employee performance (Konrad and
 Mangel 2000), and positively correlate with a firm's share
 price (Arthur 2003). However, such programs are not a
 panacea in addressing WFC, FWC, and job stress effects.
 Management must be careful to design work-life initiatives
 with the specific needs of employees in mind. For example,
 work-life initiatives have been shown to be more effective
 for companies with an educated and professional workforce
 (such as our samples) (Konrad and Mangel 2000). There-
 fore, we recommend that managers assess sources of WFC,
 FWC, and job stress and design programs that include the
 most appropriate elements for their workforce. Not to con-
 sider each workforce individually may result in such poli-
 cies being ineffective (Rau and Hyland 2002).

 Third, managers can offer stress management work-

 shops that, instead of offering employees advice on how to
 live life, ask for help in understanding how family roles
 affect work and what management can do about it (Osland,
 Kolb, and Rubin 2001). Workshops can create a welcoming
 forum in which employees freely provide suggestions for
 the better support of family roles. There is some evidence
 that workshops can reduce stress. Kossek, Colquitt, and
 Noe (2001) show that employee anxiety, irritability, and
 depression are reduced when managers encourage employ-
 ees to openly discuss family concerns with supervisors and
 peers. Thus, even the simple notion of seeking employee
 feedback can help employees feel more valued and less
 stressed.

 adequately with an identified threat (i.e., dissatisfied family
 or superiors) (Lazarus and Folkman 1984). Thus, firms
 should consider assisting employees in developing relation-
 ship skills to successfully juggle competing roles.

 Theoretical Implications, Further Research, and
 Limitations

 Incremental effects of WFC, FWC, and job stress. Tradi-
 tional models view the effects of WFC and FWC (job stres-
 sors) on performance as likely being mediated by job stress
 and the effects of job stress on customer outcomes as likely
 being mediated by performance. However, our results sug-
 gest that this is not the case. In the high-stress customer ser-
 vice job, outside-role conflicts can directly affect perfor-
 mance, and within-domain stress can directly affect
 customer outcomes. Thus, future models may want to con-
 sider the context of the job when specifying relationships
 among WFC, FWC, job stress, performance, and customer
 outcomes. When conflicts in the work-family interface and
 job stress are high, these constructs may directly affect
 important behavioral outcomes for employees and
 customers.

 Relative effects of WFC, FWC, and job stress. Both the-

 ory and intuition suggest that FWC has a stronger effect on
 CDERP than does WFC. However, the overall pattern of
 results suggests that this is not the case. Our results show a
 direct "spillover effect" of WFC that affects CDERP. More-
 over, our results show that indirect and total effects of WFC
 on CDERP and CPI are stronger than are the indirect and
 total effects of FWC on CDERP and CPI. We offer two
 speculative explanations as to why we obtained such
 results.

 Fourth, properly trained managers can institute changes
 to the work itself. For example, employee compensation
 packages could be restructured to reward customer satisfac-
 tion in addition to rewarding prescribed in-role outcomes
 (e.g., call-time quotas). Indeed, some call centers have low-
 ered expectations for the number of customer problems
 handled per shift and instead have empowered employees to
 take as long as is necessary to satisfy customer needs (Mol-
 pus 2003). Furthermore, managers could offer service
 employees a "voice" in determining aspects of their jobs.
 For example, managers could restructure systems for sched-
 uled employee breaks (in their busy complaint-handling
 days) that allow employees to participate in the decision as
 to when the breaks are needed. Thus, managers and super-
 visors can create a culture that empowers employees, which
 may have the effect of helping employees balance the
 work-family interface and make the work itself less
 stressful.

 Fifth, firms may benefit from bolstering the mental

 health benefits for employees who cope with stress and con-
 flict that stem from the work-family interface. An initiative
 that seems particularly relevant is to assist employees in
 role and boundary management. Qualified mental health
 professionals can help employees manage personal relation-
 ships both at work and at home. There is evidence that the
 relationship between stressor and stress is largely the out-
 come of a person believing that he or she is unable to cope

 First, perhaps employees are cognizant of the potential

 for FWC to affect their job performance, and thus they
 engage in processes or behaviors that partially compensate
 for the effect. However, the opposite may not be true.
 Employees may not be aware of the potential for WFC to
 affect job performance, and thus they may not engage in
 cognitive processes or behaviors that could reduce the
 effect. Second, it has recently been demonstrated that FWC
 is likely to have a strong effect on work performance when
 the pressure to participate in the family domain (pressure
 from the family) is strong and the pressure to participate in
 the work domain (pressure from the firm or supervisors) is
 concurrently weak (Greenhaus and Powell 2003). However,
 in customer service settings, the opposite may be more
 likely. Given the importance of employee performances in
 affecting customer evaluations, the pressure to participate in
 the work role could be stronger than the pressure to partici-
 pate in the family role, resulting in a weaker FWC ->
 CDERP path. Further studies could examine why the
 WFC -> job performance spillover effect is so strong. What
 are other potential reasons for it? Is it as likely in less stress-
 ful marketing jobs?

 With respect to the relative effects of job stress, we

 found that it affected IRP more than it did CDERP. In
 stressful customer service job situations, when employees
 believe that they are unable to perform all roles, they may
 perceive doing extra things that help affect customer evalu-

 ations as more salient to their job-role identity. Further stud-
 ies might consider investigating different dimensions of
 performance and the relative effects of job stress on each
 dimension.

 Limitations and further research. Our results are tem-
 pered with certain limitations. First, given that we collected
 WFC, FWC, and job stress measures cross-sectionally,
 establishing a temporal ordering among these constructs is
 not possible. Although our posited flow of WFC and FWC
 as correlated constructs that affect job stress is consistent
 with most research, other specifications are tenable
 (Williams and Alliger 1994). Although we estimated such
 alternative models and found a pattern of results similar to
 that which we report in Table 3, further studies that use
 experiments may better detect the causality among WFC,
 FWC, and job stress. For example, Greenhaus and Powell
 (2003) manipulated family- and work-role pressures to
 determine their effects on the decision to participate in a
 work activity versus a family activity. Such experiments
 may be useful to better show the causal flow among WFC,
 FWC, and job stress.

 Second, we did not collect two critical measures of role

 salience: (1) the importance of the family role versus the
 job role for employees and (2) the importance of CDERP
 versus IRP. Such measures could have helped solidify the
 findings and bolster the use of identity theory as a basis for
 some of the hypotheses. Third, the WFC measure was more
 strongly related to job stress than was the FWC measure.
 Although this finding is consistent with the theoretical
 rationale for the WFC and FWC relationships with job
 stress, wording of the WFC items may suggest more of a
 content similarity to job stress than does the wording of the
 FWC items. Further studies might elect to use a job stress
 measure that assesses symptomatic health aspects related to
 work (e.g., high blood pressure, loss of appetite). Fourth,
 we examined only one customer per service employee, and
 we related customer-specific purchase intent to employee
 performance measures, encompassing a six-month period.
 Although extensive procedures suggest that our customer
 samples were not biased and the literature suggests that
 employee performance is relatively stable over time, further
 studies that examine multiple customers per employee are
 warranted.
