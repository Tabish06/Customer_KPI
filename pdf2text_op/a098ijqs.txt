Summary of practical implications
Over the last ten years, total quality management (TQM) has been increasingly
viewed as a critical competitive weapon by firms around the world. Commitment
of top management has been cited as one of the most important factors impacting
the success potential of TQM in a firm. This has been claimed by practicing
quality gurus such as Deming, Juran and Crosby. The same notion is also
reflected in the opinions of researchers in the leadership, human resource
management, and operations management literature. However, as it happens
with any management strategy, practitioners keep wondering the exact manner
in  which  top  management  commitment  affects  TQM  success.  Is  top
management’s role different in firms that are producing low quality products
versus those that are superior performers? If so, how does the top management’s
commitment affect execution of other important TQM implementation elements
such as supplier quality management, benchmarking, and SPC? Are the
dynamics of the impact of top management commitment on these implementation
elements distinctly different in low versus high quality firms? Answers to such
questions are critical to advancing the practice and theory of quality management
and these answers can be obtained only through an empirical analysis of how
TQM is being implemented in actual firms. We do not know of any study so far
that has focused explicitly on the role of top management commitment in quality
management.

This paper is among the first (probably the first) to report a focused
empirical  analysis  of  the  effect  of  varying  levels  of  top  management
commitment on the critical TQM outcome of product quality. Through a large
scale survey of quality management practices in 449 manufacturing plants in
the auto parts suppliers industry (SIC 3714), we compiled a dataset with high
reliability and validity. Information was obtained on intensity of various
practices and results through responses offered by plant managers on eleven
dimensions (constructs); namely, top management commitment, customer
focus, supplier quality management, design quality management, bench-

marking, SPC, internal quality information usage, employee training, employee
empowerment, employee involvement, and product quality. The following
observations of practical value emerged from the analysis:

•

Firms with high top management commitment implement the other nine
TQM implementation elements more rigorously than those with low top
management commitment.
In firms with high top management commitment, variations among the
other nine TQM implementation constructs do not affect product quality
significantly.
In firms with low top management commitment, four of the nine
implementation constructs, namely, customer focus, empowerment,
internal quality information usage, and supplier quality management
are primary predictors of quality.

Thus, in conclusion, the study gives some specific indications about the role of
top management commitment in TQM implementation. Manufacturing plants
which are characterized by low top management commitment could benefit
more by themselves focusing on, and convincing the top management to
support customer focus, empowerment, internal quality information usage, and
supplier quality management. As results of these efforts start accruing, top
management  commitment  may  increase.  When  a  firm  enters  the  top
management commitment regime, all the nine implementation constructs
should be executed more rigorously. At that stage, variations among the nine
implementation  elements  may  not  affect  the  resulting  product  quality
significantly. Because the study was conducted exclusively for one industry, it
ensured a focused analysis of the research questions by eliminating inter-
industry variations in quality practices. A replication of the study for other
industries will further validate the insights.

Introduction
TQM  represents  an  integrated  approach  to  managing  the  quality  of  an
organization’s products and processes. While a great number of firms have
adopted integrated quality management strategies, their implementation has not
been equally successful (Cole, 1993; Cole, 1990; Wall Street Journal, 1992; Spector
and Beer, 1994). The implementation failure has been attributed to a shift in
emphasis from improving product quality to unfocused improvement efforts such
as installing a piecemeal SPC system, or starting training programs without
understanding their impact on quality (Cole, 1993; Schaffer and Thomson, 1992).
TQM literature, until recently, has largely consisted of descriptions of, and
prescriptions for, successful quality efforts. Several useful elements of TQM have
emerged  from  these  case  studies  and  conceptual  papers.  For  example,
benchmarking, statistical process control, employee training and involvement
programs have been identified as the most commonly implemented TQM
elements (Ebrahimpour, 1985; Modarress and Ansari, 1989; Schroeder et al.,

1992). However, due to a paucity of insights into the interactions among various
strategies, organizations most often employ them in isolation. Such an unfocused
effort may lead to a failed quality management program. Hence, it is important to
develop the theory of quality management that can be empirically validated. It is
necessary to empirically investigate linkages among the TQM elements and
identify the elements critical to improving a firm’s operational performance. To
this end, Ahire et al., (1996) present a comprehensive set of TQM implementation
and outcome constructs at the plant level. Specifically, their instrument included
ten TQM implementation constructs (top management commitment, customer
focus, supplier quality management, design quality management, benchmarking,
statistical process control (SPC) usage, internal quality information usage,
employee empowerment, employee involvement, and employee training) along
with the product quality TQM outcome construct. The instrument was refined
and validated through a study of 371 plants in the US automotive components
manufacturing industry (SIC 3714). Subsequently, an identical survey was
undertaken in the Canadian automotive parts manufacturing industry (response
sample size = 137 plants). 

We use the general framework and constructs developed by Ahire et al.
(1996) for the work reported here. The purpose of our paper is twofold. First,
hypothesized relationships of the ten TQM implementation constructs with
product quality are investigated using stepwise multiple regression. This
provides a multivariate test of the associations of the identified implementation
constructs with product quality. The second and major goal of this paper is to
examine the impact of top management commitment on TQM implementation
from two perspectives:

(2)

influence of top management commitment on the intensity of execution
of the remaining nine implementation constructs and the resultant
product quality; and
its  effect  on  the  multivariate  association  of  the  remaining  nine
implementation constructs with product quality. 

The composite dataset of the US automotive parts manufacturing firms from
Ahire et al. (1996) and their follow-up study of the Canadian auto parts firms
(total sample size = 508 plants) was used for our analysis. Two factors allowed
the consolidation of the datasets. First, high levels of organizational, behavioral,
and managerial similarities have been noted between US and Canadian firms
(Hofstede, 1983). Second, univariate t-tests on the combined dataset showed no
significant differences along any of the ten constructs between the US and
Canadian  firms.  For  evaluating  the  impact  of  different  degrees  of  top
management commitment on TQM implementation, the sample was split,
based on the mean construct score for the top management commitment
construct, into two groups: one group of firms with high top management
commitment  and  the  other  group  of  firms  with  low  top  management
commitment. In the first step, univariate t-test statistics were used to compare
these groups of firms along the remaining nine implementation constructs and

the resulting product quality. In the second step, the multivariate associations of
the nine constructs with product quality were examined for the two groups to
find out how the dynamics of TQM implementation is influenced by different
levels of top management commitment. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, the relevant
literature is discussed, demonstrating the need for the research reported here.
Next, the specific research goals and hypotheses investigated in this study are
presented. This is followed by the research methods used. The next section
presents the results of statistical analyses. These results are discussed in the
following section. Finally, implications of the findings for TQM research and
practice are offered. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research. 

Literature review
The early literature on quality management was replete with prescriptions for
attaining high quality, and case studies highlighting the successes of individual
organizations. Ahire et al. (1995) provide a comprehensive synthesis of the work
done in this field since the 1970s until early 1990s. A shift in the TQM literature
toward empirically rigorous research focusing on the critical operational
elements of TQM approach and linking them to the operational performance of
firms has been recommended in several studies (Ahire, et al., 1995; Cole, 1993;
Procter & Gamble Co., 1992). Only recently has empirical research, focused on
developing the theory of quality management, started to appear in scholarly
journals  in  management.  For  example,  three  research  papers  present
empirically validated and refined sets of integrative quality management
constructs (Ahire et al., 1996; Flynn et al., 1994; Saraph et al., 1989). Saraph et al.
(1989) presented the first set of empirically validated integrated quality
management  elements.  They  operationalized  these  elements  from  the
prescriptions of four quality gurus (Crosby et al.) and empirically validated and
refined them through a survey of 152 managers. Flynn et al. (1994) developed a
more comprehensive set of TQM implementation constructs through a review
of the past practitioner and empirical literature. They also conducted a more
rigorous statistical validation and refinement of these constructs through a
survey of manufacturing plants in several industries. Such valid constructs are
essential to undertaking the development and testing of predictive theories of
quality  management  (Flynn  et  al.,  1994).  Such  empirically  validated
measurement instruments are very critical to developing or testing any theory
of TQM, because they represent valid measurements of various components of
TQM implementation, and can be used to investigate the interrelationships
among the various elements. 

Little research on developing or testing integrative TQM theories has been
reported in the literature. There is an urgent need to theoretically and
empirically identify what pairings of individual TQM elements will be
necessary for attaining success on TQM efforts (Spenser, 1994). The 1994
special issue of Academy of Management Review (Vol. 19 No. 3) represents one
of the first attempts to link traditional management theories to the domain of

TQM.  For  example,  Spenser  (1994)  examined  TQM  in  relation  to  the
mechanistic, organismic, and cultural models of organization in order to bridge
the void between TQM practice and management theory. She highlighted
analogies between the two, i.e. Deming’s model of TQM and the mechanistic
model. Anderson et al. (1994) examined Deming’s 14 points and deciphered
seven major quality management concepts through a Delphi study. With the
help of literature from organizational behavior and scientific management
theory, they proposed various relationships among the identified concepts.
Waldman (1994) developed a theory of individual performance based on an
integration of the TQM perspective and management theory and research. His
work highlighted the issues related to the contribution of person and systems
factors to individual performance in a TQM environment. The most recent
special issue of Decision Sciences with a research focus on global quality
management includes two significant articles dealing with TQM theory
development and testing (Anderson et al., 1995; Flynn et al., 1995). 

Some studies have undertaken empirical hypotheses testing in specific TQM
implementation elements such as human resource management. Through a
comprehensive cross-sectional survey of more than 100 plants, Snell and Dean
(1992) studied the impact of three components of integrated manufacturing:
advanced manufacturing technology (AMT), total quality management (TQM),
and just-in-time production (JIT) on various human resource management
(HRM) practices. They drew on the human capital perspective of HRM to test the
correlation of these three components to selecting, training, developing, and
rewarding operations employees and quality employees. The study derived
useful insights about the relevance of various HRM issues in the context of the
three components of integrated manufacturing. Griffin (1988) provided a
longitudinal assessment of the impact of quality control circles (QCC) on the
attitudes and behaviors of participants. Measuring the attitude and behavior
construct on four dimensions: job satisfaction, organizational commitment, QC
performance rating, and intention to quit, he concluded that the enthusiasm level
of participants increased for the first two years and then dwindled. Griffin
suggested that the context and general nature of participation as a group
process, and not a given participative technique such as QCC, causes the change
effects to first increase and then diminish over a period of time. Harber et al.
(1993) and Harber et al. (1991) empirically proved the hypothesis that employee
participation in TQM will be contingent on the level of the participant in the
organization. They also tested the longitudinal effect of TQM progression on
perceived participation and reported that this doesn’t change but that different
components of satisfaction are affected differently. Ebrahimpour and Withers
(1992) empirically proved the hypothesis that the firms intending to use TQM or
JIT have higher levels of worker involvement in quality efforts and higher TQC
tools usage than the firms which do not use these programs (traditional US
firms). However, among all empirical studies published yet, only Benson et al.
(1991)  have  reported  a  comprehensive,  integrative  empirical  testing  of
interactions among various TQM elements and their impact on outcome

measures. They examined the effect of organizational context such as size,
existing quality culture, corporate support for quality, and external demands on
the managerial perception of actual and ideal quality management, and in turn,
on quality performance. Anderson et al. (1995) tested a path model for the theory
of TQM developed in Anderson et al., 1994. One of their major exploratory
findings deals with the impact of organizational leadership on creating
organizational form and instituting organizational practices that bolster quality
improvement. Finally, Flynn et al. (1995) empirically explored the impact of
various quality management practices on quality performance at the plant level.
They also noted the supporting role of top management support for creating
organizational infrastructure and improving core quality management practices. 
Overall, although the focus of research papers is shifting from specific
domains such as employee involvement or SPC to testing of integrative
theories, the TQM literature still lacks comprehensive empirical studies
examining the relationships between individual TQM elements and their role in
TQM outcome. Our research reported here represents a contribution to this
dimension of TQM theory development.

The impact of top management commitment in successful implementation of
quality efforts has been described as critical in literature. However, with the
exception of two recent exploratory papers (Anderson et al., 1995; Flynn et al.,
1995), an empirical assessment of the manner in which it affects quality efforts
and outcomes has not been undertaken. An understanding of the role of top
management commitment in quality efforts is pivotal to enhancing the success
rates of integrated quality management programs. For example, when top
management first learns about TQM they are often quick to “convert”. However,
a top management team which adopts this approach without a serious
evaluation of the efforts and resource requirements heads quickly towards
failure (Adler, 1988; Ahire and Rana, 1995; Ettore, 1993). Top management must
go beyond merely adopting slogans of improving quality and actually become
involved in quality efforts at various planning, implementation and monitoring
phases.  The  impact  top  management  commitment  has  on  the  various
dimensions (constructs) of quality management, such as customer focus,
benchmarking, and employee empowerment has not been empirically studied.
Similarly the impact of top management commitment to quality on the
relationship between the dimensions of quality management and the resultant
quality of products has been largely ignored. We conduct specific investigation
of this pervasive role of top management commitment in TQM implementation. 

Hypotheses
The Malcolm Baldrige award guidelines represent a broad framework for
assessing the quality efforts in organizations. From an implementation
standpoint, organizations need specific factors which can be used to compare
quality efforts across organizations. Empirically validated constructs of TQM
are thus necessary for consistently measuring the extent and quality of TQM
implementation efforts in firms (Flynn et al., 1994).

Recently, Ahire et al. (1996) developed a comprehensive instrument to
measure integrated quality management from a thorough review of the
prescriptive, conceptual, practitioner, and empirical literature on quality
management. The instrument identified ten implementation constructs and one
outcome construct, namely:

(1) top management commitment;

(6) statistical process control (SPC) usage;
(7) internal quality information usage;
(8) employee empowerment;
(9) employee involvement;
(10) employee training;
(11) product quality. 

These constructs span almost the entire range of activities deemed critical by the
Malcolm Baldrige award (US Dept of Commerce and Technology Admin, 1995).
The scales were empirically validated using plant managers from 371 plants in
one single industry. A comprehensive scale refinement and validation was
conducted through rigorous statistical procedures to ensure high content
validity, unidimensionality, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and
criterion-related validity. The results of scale refinement and validation are
discussed in detail in (Ahire et al., 1996). Note that this approach to construct
validation has been used extensively in contemporary research in marketing and
organizational behavior (Gardner et al., 1994; Germain et al., 1994; Kumar et al.,
1995; Novak et al., 1994; Posdakoff and Mackenzie, 1994; Venkatraman, 1989).
The refined scales for the ten implementation constructs and the product quality
outcome construct used in our analysis are summarized in the Appendix.

Quality constructs – product quality links
Improving the quality of products is an important goal of quality efforts (US
Dept of Commerce and Technology Admin, 1995). This is because product
quality can be used as a strategic competitive weapon of market leadership in
the long run (Ferdows and Demeyer, 1990; Zeithaml, 1988). Product quality also
possesses a logical proximity with the TQM implementation efforts. Hence,
product quality was adopted as the operational outcome measure of TQM
efforts (Ahire et al., 1996). Specifically, four of Garvin’s eight dimensions of
product quality were included: performance, conformance, reliability, and
durability (Garvin, 1987).

The ten TQM implementation constructs developed by Ahire et al. (1996)
represent dimensions along which integrated quality efforts manifest themselves.
The available literature on quality management suggests that each of these
constructs are linked to product quality. In this section, we present literature-
supported hypotheses for associations of these constructs with product quality. 
First and foremost, high top management commitment propels TQM by
creating values, goals, and systems that lead to satisfied customers and
improved organizational performance (Senge, 1990). Sincere efforts by top
management go beyond slogans and provide vision and broad goals that direct
quality  efforts.  Furthermore,  effective  top  managers  conduct  realistic
assessments of resource requirements and plan for these resources. The clarity
of quality goals in an organization determines the effectiveness of the quality
efforts (Senge, 1990; Stalk et al., 1992). A top management team committed to
quality conveys the philosophy that quality receives priority over cost and
schedule, and that in the long run, superior and consistent quality leads to
improvements in cost and delivery performance (Ferdows and Demeyer, 1990;
Garvin, 1984; Krajewski and Ritzman, 1993). Upper management should not
only give quality the highest priority possible, but upper management should
also demonstrate its commitment to quality by providing adequate resources for
implementing quality management. In particular, this is accomplished through
investments in human and financial resources (Chapman et al., 1991; Ham and
Williams, 1986). For example, assessing the performance of plant managers and
top corporate executives should include consideration of their involvement in the
management of quality (Saraph et al., 1989). Some successful quality efforts have
illustrated that these initiatives result in high quality products (in terms of
performance, conformance, reliability and durability) for the organization due to
focused quality efforts (e.g., Asahi Breweries Ltd., Japan (Nakajo and Kono,
1989); Xerox, Inc., USA. (Kennedy, 1989); Dunlop, Ltd., Malaysia (Fah, 1988); and
Dow-Corning Pty Ltd., Australia (Chapman et al., 1991)). 

For successful quality management, however, leadership must translate its
commitment into a set of actions. These actions should be aimed at enhancing
the ability to:

•

•

•

compile and effectively analyze relevant information external to the firm
(customer focus, benchmarking, and supplier quality management);
collect and make a better use of quality related information inside the
firm (SPC, design quality management, and internal quality information
usage); and
ensure better application of quality information by employees (employee
empowerment, employee involvement, and employee training). 

When the leaders of organizations provide direction and resource supporting
quality, higher quality products are more likely to result. 

Customer focus is very critical to an effective quality management initiative,
because it places the ultimate objective of the initiative in clear view (Baldrige

Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 11:51 15 February 2017 (PT)
Guidelines, 1995). All activities of an organization must be planned and
executed toward improving processes leading to high quality products.
However, quality must be incorporated into these activities with a clear
customer focus. Despite the use of latest process improvement techniques and
capable management, a firm’s neglect of its customers may lead to disaster
(Kordupleski et al. 1993). Further complicating matters, customer expectations
are dynamic in nature (Shepetuk, 1991). Hence, an organization needs to assess
them regularly and adjust its operations accordingly (Takeuchi and Quelch,
1983). Organizations may outperform their competition by:

•

•
•

responding  quickly  to  customers’  demands  with  new  ideas  and
technologies;
producing products that satisfy or exceed customers’ expectations; and
anticipating and responding to their customers’ evolving needs and
wants (Stalk et al., 1992).

•

Therefore, the customer focus must be reflected in the overall planning and
execution of quality efforts. Thus, customer focus assessed by:
the frequency and rigor of customer satisfaction surveys;
dissemination of the survey analyses to functional areas such as
manufacturing, design and planning;
use of these in direct decisions on product quality improvement (Hauser
and Clausing, 1988; Juran, 1981a; Lascalles and Dale, 1989) is reflected in
product quality.

•

Benchmarking of an organization’s products helps focus quality efforts on
feasible and effective features of products proven in the market. It also helps an
organization improve its manufacturing and support processes through the
adoption of the most successful practices of competitors and non-competitors in
other industries using similar processes (Ettore, 1993; Camp, 1989). Leading
corporations, like Xerox, have claimed since the 1980s that this approach
contributes directly to quantum improvements in the quality of their products
(Camp, 1989; Kennedy, 1989).

Superior quality of incoming material from technically competent, reliable,
and flexible suppliers is a prerequisite to superior quality of the finished
product (Juran, 1981a; Stamm and Golhar, 1993). Thus, effective supplier
quality management is highly desirable, and should contribute to high quality
products. The following dimensions define the effectiveness in managing the
quality of supplied materials:

•

•

good supplier evaluation, considering technical and financial capability
(Giunipero and Brewer, 1993), and operational efficiency, including
delivery and quality performance (Newman, 1988a; Newman, 1988b); and
a history with a few long term suppliers (Juran, 1981a; Lascalles and
Dale, 1989).

Design quality management entails specific tools and strategies used to design
quality into products instead of ensuring quality after manufacturing by
removing defective products (Bognossian, 1988). Techniques such as quality
function deployment fool-proof the design of products (Bognossian, 1988;
Hauser and Clausing, 1988). Techniques like Taguchi’s design of experiments
and Shingo’s error-proofing methods improve the quality of manufacturing
processes for the products (Benton, 1991; Robinson and Schroeder, 1990;
Taguchi and Clausing, 1983). An effective design quality management process
involves all constituencies (namely, design engineers, production, marketing,
suppliers and customers) in the product design stage and is expected to improve
the quality of products through techniques which impact their performance,
reliability, durability and conformance to specifications (Bognossian, 1988;
Hauser and Clausing, 1988; Juran, 1981a; Juran, 1981b; Ziemke and Spann, 1991). 
Statistical Process Control (SPC) is one of the most widely used quantitative
techniques used in manufacturing process quality assurance (Benton, 1991;
Handfield, 1989; Modarress and Ansari, 1989). Use of specific techniques such as
control charts helps monitor the reliability of processes. When used in conjunction
with corrective measures for those processes that shift beyond control limits, SPC
helps assure the consistent quality of finished products (Benton, 1991).

Effective dissemination and use of information influences the success of
quality improvement efforts (Kono, 1993; Shepetuk, 1991). For example, unless
defects are tracked at work-stations and corrective actions taken on the relevant
problems, the quality information that is generated will be wasted. Thus,
managers and workers need to know in detail the sources of problems (Suresh
and Merideth, 1985; Sylla, 1988). This feedback will be very difficult in absence
of an infrastructure able to disseminate quality data in a usable form (US Dept
of Commerce and Technology Admin, 1995). Thus, it can be hypothesized that
effective internal quality information usage results in higher product quality by
facilitating the quality improvement efforts. 

The aforementioned constructs represent systemic dimensions of quality
management. In order for top management to effectively implement these
systemic constructs, however, human resource management must be properly
aligned (Adler, 1988; Cole, 1993). Quality-oriented human resource management
is a key link in successful implementation of these strategies. It shapes the
quality management environment through:

•

•

•

empowering employees, thus enabling them to make decisions related to
quality;
ensuring an infrastructure is in place that supports full employee
participation; and
training employees in the technical and managerial aspects of their role
in TQM. 

Employee empowerment is demonstrated through a delegation of authority for
in-process quality control to the line-workers, assignment of responsibility for

the quality results, and provision of technical and managerial support to aid
workers in quality efforts. It has been argued that these elements lead to more
and better worker involvement in quality improvement efforts (Deming, 1986;
Harber et al., 1991; Oliver, 1988). They can also be linked theoretically to
improvements in product quality. For example, the stop-the-line approach has
yielded a dramatic improvement in product quality in world-class organizations
like Toyota (Everett and Sohal, 1991).

Employee involvement strategies like quality circles and cross-functional teams
have been used successfully by many organizations to realize gains in different
phases of quality improvement. For example, cross-functional teams have been
used in new product development and distribution management (Carmel, 1995;
Marion, 1995; Pooley, 1994; Port, 1989). Quality circles also have been used with
mixed success in quality efforts (Bocker and Overgaard, 1982; Dale and Duncalf,
1984). It has been demonstrated in practice that judicious application of these tools
combined with team-based incentives can result in useful suggestions that
improve the quality of processes and products (Cole et al., 1993; Krantz, 1989).

Finally, employee training at all levels is seen as a particularly important
part of successful quality efforts (Ebrahimpour, 1985; Juran, 1978; Juran, 1981a;
Lee and Ebrahimpour, 1985). The Baldrige award considers a firms’ efforts in
providing quality training to employees very carefully (US Dept of Commerce
and Technology Admin, 1995). It is argued that formal training in statistical
tools, group problem solving, and communication techniques helps employees
to participate more effectively in quality management (Cortell and Derrick,
1992; Galagan, 1992). Including employees from different levels of the hierarchy
in training also breaks down communication barriers and thus helps improve
quality efforts (Cortell and Derrick, 1992). The emphasis placed by all
successful high product quality firms on quality training for employees leads to
a  belief  that,  through  a  higher  quality  of  employee  involvement  and
suggestions, the specific training strategies should help improve the quality of
a firm’s processes and, in turn, the quality of its products.

Thus, TQM is an integrated implementation of the ten implementation
constructs, namely, top management commitment, customer focus, supplier
quality management, design quality management, benchmarking, statistical
process control (SPC) usage, internal quality information usage, employee
empowerment, employee involvement, employee training. The focal point of
these constructs is the quality of the products the firm produces. Therefore,
product quality must be considered a critical outcome measure of TQM efforts.
All told, an effective implementation of the ten TQM elements should result in
higher quality products. Based on the foregoing discussion, the following ten
hypotheses were examined:

H1-1/10: Product quality is positively related to top management commit-
ment, customer focus, supplier quality management, design
quality management, benchmarking, SPC, internal quality infor-
mation usage, employee empowerment, employee involvement,
and employee training.

Role of top management commitment in integrated quality management
Management research has found that the commitment of top management is
crucial to the success of any effort aimed at changing the operational philosophy
of the organization. Without the support of management the behavior of the
members of the organization is unlikely to change. It has been argued that change
will be more successful if upper management is committed to the change (Senge,
1990). The critical role of top managers in shaping the success of strategic
changes in organizations is also noted often (Bourgeois and Eisenhardt, 1988).
Top management plays a decisive role in paradigm shifts in critical areas such as
quality management, product development and innovation (Hoffman and
Hagerty, 1994; Johne and Snelson, 1989).

This  strong  influence  attributed  to  top  management  is  not  terribly
surprising. Employees throughout the organization need to impress upper
management in order to advance up the corporate ladder. When top manage-
ment reveals its commitment to a given strategy, this provides subordinates
with salient clues for impressing upper management. Thus, when a firm
attempts to implement a planned change, employees at all levels are more likely
to invest time and effort in the change program if that program has the full and
credible support of top management (Cole et al., 1993; Krantz, 1989). 

No discussion of effective TQM practices can be complete without examining
the often-stated pivotal role top management plays in implementing TQM. The
quality  literature  abounds  with  discussions  of  the  importance  of  top
management commitment in envisioning, planning, and implementing TQM in
firms. It has been proposed that top management commitment is one of the
major determinants of successful TQM implementation (Dale and Duncalf,
1984; Ebrahimpour, 1985; Lascalles and Dale, 1989). The quality leadership role
of top management has been presented for such several diverse organizations
as Asahi Breweries Ltd., Japan (Nakajo and Kono, 1989); Xerox, Inc., USA
(Kennedy, 1989); and Dow-Corning Pty Ltd., Australia (Chapman et al., 1991).
Research has suggested that the clarity of quality goals for an organization
determines the effectiveness of the quality efforts (Senge, 1990; Stalk et al.,
1992). Setting these clear goals is the responsibility of top management. When
top management is committed to quality it conveys the philosophy that quality
matters through several actions:

•

•

•

assigning a higher priority to quality over cost or schedule (Ferdows and
Demeyer, 1990; Garvin, 1984);
providing  adequate  resources  to  the  implementation  of  quality
management efforts;
investing in human and financial resources (Chapman et al., 1991; Ham
and Williams, 1986); and 

• making quality a dimension in performance evaluations for every one in

the organization (Saraph et al., 1989).

The commitment of top management to quality improvement increases the
likelihood that quality efforts are successful. Spector and Beer (1994) examined
the TQM efforts in four large organizations and found that a shared commit-
ment among top managers to quality greatly influenced the success of these
efforts. Bullington and Bullington (1991) argued that top management
commitment is a prerequisite to attainment of world-class quality. 

While the importance of top management commitment in quality manage-
ment has been extensively discussed, empirical examination of the degree and
manner in which it affects specific outcomes, such as product quality, has not
been investigated. The linkage between top management commitment to qual-
ity and quality of products may not be direct. Top management commitment
encourages subordinates to invest more fully in the particular elements for
which they are responsible, thereby increasing the impact of these elements on
the quality of products. Therefore, one could expect the extent of top manage-
ment commitment to quality to influence the amount of effort that employees
devote to managing quality of material from suppliers, designing good
products and processes, benchmarking the firm’s processes and products,
using manufacturing quality assurance through use of SPC techniques,
empowering subordinates, acquiring and providing quality training, and
implementing involvement and participation strategies. In a firm with a high
level of top management commitment to quality, one would expect not only a
higher level of execution of the other nine constructs, but also a higher quality
of products. 

H3:

From the above discussion, one would expect a much better implementation
of these constructs in firms with high top management commitment and a
superior product quality attained in these firms as compared to the firms with
low top management commitment to quality. This argument led to the following
hypotheses:
H2-1/9:

Firms  with  a  high  level  of  top  management  commitment
demonstrate more effective implementation of the remaining nine
implementation elements.
Firms with a high level of top management commitment (high-
top firms) produce higher quality products as compared to those
with a low level of top management commitment (low-top firms).
Additionally, one would also expect that because all of the nine TQM constructs
are implemented effectively, the variation in the implementation of individual
constructs does not affect the resultant product quality. In contrast, the
relationship can be expected to be different in firms with low top management
commitment, where some factors may have more impact on the product quality
than others. For example, localized quality efforts such as incoming material
quality control or SPC usage can lead to some improvement in product quality
(Stamm and Golhar, 1993). Hence, we empirically examined the relationships of
the other nine implementation elements with resulting product quality in

different contexts of top management commitment to quality. Hence, the
following hypothesis was tested:

H4:

The relationship among TQM constructs and product quality
differs between high top management commitment firms and low
top management commitment firms. 

Note that H1 actually consists of ten individual hypotheses, hypothesizing a
positive relationship between product quality and each of the ten TQM
implementation  constructs.  Similarly,  H2 consists  of  nine  individual
hypotheses, hypothesizing a superior execution of each of the remaining nine
TQM implementation constructs in high-top firms as compared to that in low-
top firms. The goal of H4 is to check if top management commitment affects the
way in which the other nine TQM constructs are executed to influence product
quality.

Methods
For the purpose of analysis, the instrument validated by Ahire et al. (1996)
was used. As stated earlier, the analysis was based on the composite sample
of 508 automotive components firms in the USA and Canada. The scales for
the ten TQM implementation constructs and the resultant product quality
construct refined in Ahire et al. (1996) are presented in the Appendix. Using
stepwise multiple regressions of the TQM implementation elements versus
resultant product quality, several insights were derived regarding the
relationships between the TQM implementation elements and consequent
product quality.

Survey methods
For both US and Canadian firms, the same instrument was employed. A seven-
point Likert scale was used for all items to ensure higher statistical variability
among survey responses (Roth and Miller, 1992; Saraph et al., 1989; Schroeder
et al., 1992). Thus, with the exception of those representing product quality,
items for all the constructs were measured on a seven-point scale (1 = strongly
disagree, 4 = neutral, 7 = strongly agree). The items for the product quality
construct were rated on a seven point scale, where 1 = worst in industry, 4 =
average, and 7 = best in industry (Schroeder et al., 1992). Responses to the
specific items on these scales were sought with reference to their primary
product, where “primary” meant the product generating the highest annual
sales revenue. Furthermore, respondents were asked to respond to items on the
supplier performance scale with reference to a component that was critical to
the quality of the primary product.

The survey was conducted for firms in a single industry: motor vehicle parts
and accessories (SIC 3714). This industry was selected because of its leadership
in implementing progressive quality management strategies (Cole, 1990). The
focus on one industry ensured a high internal validity, albeit at the expense of
external validity. The unit of analysis was a manufacturing plant as this is

where  TQM  is  most  often  operationalized  in  manufacturing  firms
(Ebrahimpour and Withers, 1992; Griffin, 1988; Schroeder et al., 1992). Plant
managers served as the key respondents as they would presumably be most
familiar with the quality improvement strategies being implemented in their
plants. Again, plant managers have been widely used as key respondents in
such empirical studies (Griffin, 1988; Schroeder et al., 1992).

Response sample
A mailing list of 1,500 plants listed in the SIC code 3714 in US and Canada was
obtained from Elm International, Inc. in Detroit, Michigan. This included 1,100
US and 400 Canadian firms. The questionnaire was pretested with 100
randomly selected US plants. Pretest respondents were asked to critique the
questionnaire in general and the items on various scales in particular. Twenty
completed  questionnaires  were  returned.  Based  on  this  feedback,  the
questionnaire was modified. The survey of the remaining 1,000 US plants was
conducted in two waves, spaced four weeks apart. After two mailings, a total of
371 usable responses were obtained. A parallel two-wave survey of the
Canadian firms was undertaken which yielded 137 usable questionnaires. Thus,
the overall response rate was 36 per cent of the total 1,400 firms included in the
main survey.

These firms represented a cross-section of the industry in terms of size,
product and process type, and unionization. Number of employees in the
plants ranged from 50 to 3,600 (mean = 342, standard deviation = 344, median
= 250, first quartile = 150, third quartile = 400). Of the 508 plants, 56 per cent
reported use of a make-to-order production process, 27 per cent reported
make-to-inventory approach, and 9 per cent reported use of both. Fifty five
per cent of the firms were unionized. A comparison of the firm size and
geographical  distribution  of  the  responding  firms  with  the  original
population of 1,400 firms revealed no major differences. Thus, the response
sample adequately represented the total sample group. As mentioned earlier,
chi-square tests for each construct indicated no statistically significant
differences between the US and Canadian firms in the response sample.
Hence, these consolidated responses formed the basis for the analysis
reported in the next section. 

Statistical analysis and results
Table I provides the descriptive statistics (mean construct score on a scale of 1
to 7 and the standard deviation). It also provides Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of
scale reliability (which measures the extent of internal consistency of a scale)
for the eleven TQM constructs (Cronbach, 1951). As mentioned before, the
scales used for this study are based on those used by Ahire et al. (1996). The
scales had already been refined and validated through rigorous statistical
procedures. The very high Cronbach’s alpha values for the constructs in Table I
further demonstrates the reliability of these scales.

particular with customer focus, supplier quality management, and employee
empowerment. While the correlations provide a bivariate measure of association
between pairs of constructs, they do not measure multivariate associations. 

Note that many of the correlations are quite high, indicating the possibility of
multicollinearity among the constructs. There are several ways to assess the
extent of multicollinearity. Kennedy (1992) suggests regressing the collinear
regressors on one another and comparing the R-squares of these models with
the R-square of the original model. To check for multicollinearity, we ran the
ordinary least square (OLS) regression of product quality versus the ten TQM
implementation constructs. Next, we ran the regressions for each of the ten
implementation constructs on the other nine. Comparing the various regression
results, we found that the R-squares of the regressions of the implementation
constructs on the other nine were higher than that of the model with product
quality as the dependent variable. This confirmed the existence of multi-
collinearity. Kennedy (1992) also advises that while multicollinearity can be
expected in studies involving perception responses of similar constructs, it is
especially harmful for statistical conclusions if it leads to variance inflation
factors (VIF) of 10 or higher. For our constructs, the VIF values ranged from 1.1
to 1.55 (with a mean of 1.27), suggesting the presence of moderate multi-
collinearity. Given that the lower bound for multicollinearity is 1.0, this does not
represent a serious concern. 

One way to deal with multicollinearity is to conduct stepwise multiple
regression for identifying the primary regressors. Hence, to test Hypothesis 1
(H1-1 through H1-10), a stepwise multiple regression model was executed for
all firms (N = 449) in SAS-package using product quality as the dependent
variable and the ten TQM implementation constructs as independent
variables (Regression Model 1). Table III provides results of Regression Model
1. Note that, of the responding 508 firms, 449 firms provided complete
responses for all of the constructs included in the regression. In order to test
Hypotheses 2 and 3, the response sample was split into two groups using 5.43,
the mean value of top management commitment construct score, as a cut-off.
Thus, the firms with a score of higher than 5.43 on this construct were
classified as high top management commitment (high-top) firms and the
others as low top management commitment (low-top) firms. For each
construct, a one-tailed t-test for the difference between mean score on the

construct for the two groups was conducted. Table IV summarizes the results
of the t-tests in terms of the t-statistic and the associated p-value. To test
Hypothesis 4, a stepwise regression model was run on the group of high-top
firms (N = 290), using product quality as the dependent variable and the ten
TQM implementation constructs as independent variables (Regression Model
2). A similar stepwise regression model was run on the group of low-top firms
(N = 159, Regression Model 3). Tables V and VI present results of Regression
Models 2 and 3. 

Regression model 1: all firms
As Table III indicates, this stepwise regression model accounts for about 25 per
cent of the variation in product quality (R2 = 0.257). It is noteworthy from the
regression coefficients (b-values) and p-values that customer focus, supplier
quality management, and empowerment are significantly and positively related
to product quality. They turn out to be the primary regressors of product
quality. Thus, three of the ten positive relationships hypothesized in Hypothesis
1 are found to be statistically significant.

High versus low top management commitment firms
Results of one-tailed t-tests for difference between means of construct scores for
the two groups in Table IV consistently indicate that firms with high top
management commitment execute each of the other nine constructs signifi-
cantly better than those with low top management commitment. High top
management commitment firms also produce higher quality products than
those with low top management commitment. Thus, Hypotheses H2-1 through
H2-9 and Hypothesis 3 are satisfied.

Regression model 2: high top management commitment (high-top) firms
It is evident from Table V that this stepwise regression model does not predict
product quality well (R2 = 0.056). Thus, in firms with high top management
commitment, the variation in execution of the nine individual TQM implemen-
tation constructs (customer focus, supplier quality management, design quality
management, benchmarking, statistical process control (SPC) usage, internal
quality information usage, employee empowerment, employee involvement,
employee training) does not explain differences in product quality. Viewed in
conjunction with Table IV results, these findings point to the argument that at
higher levels of top management commitment, the other nine implementation
constructs are executed effectively, and minor variations in how the individual
constructs are executed does not significantly impact product quality.

(b-values) and p-values that customer focus, empowerment, internal quality
information usage, and supplier quality management are significantly and
positively related to product quality. These four are the primary predictors of
product quality. Thus, in firms with low top management commitment, the
variation in execution of the nine individual TQM implementation constructs
(customer focus, supplier quality management, design quality management,
benchmarking, statistical process control (SPC) usage, internal quality
information usage, employee empowerment, employee involvement, employee
training) does explain differences in product quality. In particular, the four
constructs identified above appear to be significant predictors of product
quality. Again, viewed in conjunction with Table IV results, these findings point
to the argument that at lower levels of top management commitment, a better
execution of the four constructs (customer focus, supplier quality management,
empowerment, and internal quality information usage) could lead to better
product quality. 

Discussion
Hypothesis 1 (consisting of ten individual hypotheses) was only partly
satisfied. Of the ten TQM implementation constructs, only three (customer
focus, supplier quality management, and empowerment) were found to be
statistically significant predictors of product quality. Note that top management
commitment did not appear as a primary predictor itself. This supports the
recent findings suggesting that top management commitment acts as an
enabler for the other environmental and infrastructural elements such as
empowerment, customer focus, and supplier quality management (Anderson et
al., 1995; Flynn et al., 1995). 

Hypothesis 2 (consisting of nine individual hypotheses) was found to be
consistently true. The high-top firms executed each of the other nine TQM
implementation constructs more effectively than low-top firms. Hypothesis 3
was found to be valid. The high-top firms demonstrated higher product quality
than  the  low-top  firms.  This  demonstrates  how  firms  with  stronger
commitment of top management will exhibit a more effective quality effort
along all dimensions, and in turn, achieve higher product quality. 

Finally, a joint analysis of Tables V and VI suggests that Hypothesis 4 is
true.  As  the  tables  indicate,  the  power  of  different  individual  TQM
implementation constructs to predict product quality in high-top firms was
considerably different as compared to low-top firms. The model for the high-top
firms (Table IV) is insignificant, while the model for the low-top firms is highly
significant. However, the lack of explanatory power in the high-top model does
not mean that in firms with strong quality commitment from top management,
quality efforts do not matter. Instead, it indicates that in these firms, the
variance across firms in the success of constructs of quality management does
not directly relate to the differences in product quality outcomes. On the other
hand, the model for the firms with low top management commitment (low-top
firms) presents a different story. For this set of firms, the variance in quality

constructs explains the majority of the variance in product quality (Table VI).
Apparently, in low-top firms, the individual attributes of quality management
become important predictors of quality outcomes. This is true, in particular, for
customer focus, employee empowerment, internal quality information usage
and supplier quality management. On the whole, the results of this study
demonstrate that customer focus in quality efforts is certainly critical for
attaining high product quality. Another similarly important factor is supplier
quality management. Finally, employee empowerment was identified as a
statistically significant factor explaining higher product quality. These findings
do support the prescriptive research in marketing, purchasing and human
resource management. However, the results from Tables IV, V, and VI provide
evidence of the mentoring and enabling role of top management commitment in
creating  an  environment  (customer  focus,  empowerment,  etc.)  and
infrastructure (supplier quality management, internal quality information
usage, etc.) needed for achieving superior product quality. For instance, it would
be hard to find a firm with superficial commitment of top management to
quality in which employees are highly empowered or long-term emphasis is
assured in supplier management or a strong customer focus is maintained in
operations. Literature on top management commitment points to its causal
effect on these environmental and infrastructural constructs. Several studies
assessing linkages between top management commitment and success of
management programs have concluded that a lack of commitment on the part
of top management leads to problems in implementation of such programs as
TQM, MBO, and JIT (Duncan, 1989; Reihl, 1988; Rodgers et al., 1993; Rodgers
and Hunter, 1991; Sethi, 1978; Shetty, 1986). Thus, although top management
commitment does not emerge as a primary direct predictor of product quality
for the entire dataset, the causal impact of top management on other constructs
representing environmental and infrastructural factors responsible for higher
product quality is supported by the results of split-sample regressions.

As noted earlier, high correlations among the constructs (Tables I and II)
raised a concern about potentially harmful multicollinearity in the dataset.
Hence, stepwise multiple regressions were used to assess the multivariate
relationships in regressions for all firms (Table III), high-top firms (Table V) and
low-top firms (Table VI). To assess the impact of multicollinearity on the
results, corresponding ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions were also run.
It was found that the results were almost identical. The R-squares of the
corresponding regressions practically remained unchanged between the OLS
and stepwise regressions. Also, the significant predictors in each OLS
regression were the only primary predictors in the corresponding stepwise
regression. Thus, the moderate multicollinearity in the data did not affect the
statistical significance of relationships. 

Finally, while we used multiple regression here to test the hypotheses, the
alternative approach of path analysis to testing a set of causative relationships
among constructs could also be used (Anderson et al., 1995; Flynn et al., 1995).
However, neither multiple regression nor path analysis prove causality

(Kennedy, 1996). The ultimate proof of causality can be obtained through
extensive longitudinal studies on a large sample of organizations. Alternatively,
either of the two methodologies (regression or path analysis) can be used for
testing such hypotheses with logical arguments in favor of the hypothesized
causalities that are rooted in theory (Camerer and Fahey, 1988; Bentler and
Weeks, 1982; Bollen, 1989). We opted for conducting stepwise regressions on
split  samples  to  demonstrate  existence  of  different  dynamics  of  TQM
implementation in different regimes of top management commitment. Similar
results were obtained when covariance structural path modeling was employed
on the entire sample (covariance structural models were not tested on split
sample as large sample sizes in excess of 400 are recommended for reliable
analysis using this technique (Jorsekog and Sorbom, 1989)). In particular, a
model with direct paths from top management commitment, customer focus,
supplier quality management and empowerment to product quality for the
entire sample turned out to be the most promising path model in terms of
goodness of fit (adjusted goodness of fit index = 0.85), other fit indices, and
parsimony, with all four paths being statistically significant. Thus, the
covariance structural modeling technique further supported the hypothesized
importance of top management commitment. 

Conclusions
Using ten previously validated TQM implementation constructs, i.e., top
management commitment, customer focus, supplier quality management,
design quality management, benchmarking, statistical process control (SPC)
usage, internal quality information usage, employee empowerment, employee
involvement, employee training and the product quality outcome construct, this
research empirically investigated the power of these ten constructs to explain
variation in product quality in manufacturing firms (sample size = 449). It also
examined how different levels of top management commitment affect the
implementation of the other constructs and their impact on the resulting
product quality.

The ten TQM constructs possessed a high level of reliability and consistently
exhibited statistically significant positive intercorrelations (Tables I and II).
Three  of  these  constructs,  namely  customer  focus,  supplier  quality
management, and empowerment were found to be the statistically significant
predictors of product quality for the entire sample (Table III). Firms with high
top management commitment executed each of the other nine implementation
constructs more effectively and produced higher quality products (Table IV).
Four of the nine implementation constructs, namely customer focus, supplier
quality management, internal quality information usage, and empowerment
explained 54 per cent of the variance in product quality in firms with low top
management commitment (Table VI), whereas the regression for product
quality for firms with high top management commitment was not statistically
significant (Table V).

The study empirically highlights the critical importance of top management
commitment to the success of TQM efforts. The findings provide an empirical
support to the prior research on organizational change programs as well as the
prescriptive literature on the role of top management in quality management.
Furthermore, they suggest an existence of different dynamics of TQM
implementation in firms with different level of top management commitment. 
The regression model for the high-top firms is not significant, suggesting
that the variance in the quality constructs across the high-top firms does not
explain the variance in product quality across this group. Thus, the results
indicate that when top management is committed to quality efforts, the success
of each of the nine identified attributes of TQM will not be significantly related
to the quality of products. This does not suggest that the quality constructs are
not important to product quality. In fact, the comparison between the high top
and low top groups points out that the high top group (Table IV) is significantly
higher on each of the quality constructs and product quality. These results
reinforce the notion that firms that pay attention to all of the attributes of
quality produce products of higher quality. It could be true that if top
management is behind the quality efforts then the rest of the quality program
falls into place. For example, firms with high top management commitment do
a better job with SPC, which results in higher quality products. With little
variance among firms, cross-sectional regressions will fail to find significant
relationships among the variables. Similarly, perhaps, when top management is
committed to quality improvement, the managers better understand which
attributes of TQM are most important in their specific context. For example,
among the high-top group a firm may spend little effort on benchmarking
because there are few firms good enough to compare with. The result, then, is a
firm with high top management commitment, low benchmarking, and high
product quality. If each firm varies according to its specific context then
regression equations that do not control for context will not capture the
relationships between the quality constructs and product quality.

The ability of four TQM implementation constructs to explain more than
half of the variance in product quality in low top firms is somewhat intriguing.
One possible explanation could be that as the level of top management
commitment falls (for whatever reasons), the impact of differentiation of
elements such as customer focus and empowerment on product quality
becomes more pronounced. Thus, in firms with half-hearted top management
commitment to quality, if operational level managers and employees manages
to  work  out  some  of  the  elements  successfully  (e.g.  supplier  quality
management, empowerment, and customer focus), it can have a noticeable
impact on product quality. However, as demonstrated by the t-tests and high-
top regression, a high level of top management commitment is highly desirable
as it propels rigorous implementation of all TQM elements and thus leads to
better product quality. 

As top management commitment increases, one would expect all of the
implementation elements to be implemented rigorously. Thus, at higher top

management commitment levels, other contextual factors (technology, product
type, etc.) may distinguish firms along product quality. Though this argument
is indirectly supported by the findings, ideally a longitudinal study could
confirm the dynamic impact of various levels of top management commitment
on a firm’s quality efforts and resulting product quality.

The results provide practitioners with empirical evidence of the steering,
mentoring and enabling influence of top management commitment on such
critical  aspects  of  quality  management  as  customer  focus,  employee
empowerment, supplier quality management, and internal quality information
usage. Practicing managers should find especially useful the positive impact of
higher top management commitment on these environmental and infra-
structural factors and resulting better product quality. Also, the observation
that variance across various implementation elements does not explain
variance in product quality for high-top firms should aid managers to focus on
other competitive priorities to surge ahead of competition. The findings should
also encourage top management of low-top firms to bolster these efforts. 

The research also contributes to the development of TQM theory in several
ways. It represents one of the first efforts to test integrative impact of many
TQM constructs on operational performance of a firm. In doing so, it uses
empirically validated constructs, thus yielding rigor and credibility to the
analysis conducted. The single-industry focus of the study ensured high
internal consistency of responses, thus improving the reliability of the
responses. It supports some existing prescriptive and descriptive findings in the
TQM literature, and sets a stage for further research on the interactions among
various TQM constructs and their impact on product quality. While it
empirically validates the importance of top management commitment for
effective implementation of other TQM implementation constructs, the study
raises some important research issues. 

First, the inability of the nine TQM constructs in high top management
commitment firms to predict product quality points to a need for detailed
investigation of the interactions among these constructs and consideration of
additional contextual factors. The complexity of products, the intensity of
competition, and the composition of the workforce influence the effectiveness
of quality efforts and can help guide managers toward designing quality
programs that fit their individual needs. Thus, these can be included as
contextual  factors  in  future  studies.  Second,  this  study  empirically
demonstrates the need for investigating the specific mechanisms by which
the role of top management commitment influences the quality process. Third,
while  the  research  demonstrates  the  importance  of  top  management
commitment to quality, we need to understand how various manifestations of
top  management  commitment  influence  quality.  For  example,  is  a
commitment of budget dollars more or less important than a change in the
appraisal system. Both signal management commitment, yet one may be more
effective than the other.

In conducting follow-up research in these directions, researchers should
remember three limitations of this study. All of them are generic limitations for
any empirical study of such nature. First, the results are based on a single-
industry study. Thus, we have striven to ensure high levels of internal validity,
albeit at the expense of external validity. Future studies of other industries may
help enhance the external validity of the findings reported here. Second, as with
any exploratory field study of this kind, it is very difficult to develop perfect
operationalizations of all constructs on the instrument. In this study, we found
that the product quality construct could have been defined better. It was based
on Garvin’s dimensions of quality. However, after preliminary discussions with
a  few  professionals  in  the  auto  parts  suppliers  industry  and  our  own
assessment of the industry product ranges, the following four dimensions were
excluded  apriori
from  the  survey  instrument:  features,  aesthetics,
serviceability, and perceived quality. The rationale behind omission of these
four dimensions was that the customers of the auto parts suppliers are highly
technical industrial customers (the auto manufacturers). The majority of the
products supplied to the big auto manufacturers are complex parts and
subassemblies that are used in making the end-products, namely automobiles.
Thus the suppliers of these parts primarily need to cater to product quality
specifications set by their customers (the auto companies). 

The assumption is that the specifications set by the customer firms reflect the
quality expectations of the final consumers (auto buyers). Assuming that the
automobile firms have incorporated the quality expectations of the final
consumers (auto buyers) into their parts specifications, the quality expectations
from the auto-parts suppliers should be predominantly based on the dimensions
of performance, conformance, reliability, and durability. The relatively soft
measures of product quality, namely aesthetics, features, serviceability, and
perceived quality should not be as critical as the other four. Again, evaluating
the importance of the various dimensions in industrial products (in contrast to
regular consumer products in which the customers are the final consumers of the
products under question), the four measures of product quality were excluded in
the empirical study (Ahire et al., 1996). On a second look at the construct,
however, it appears that instead of omitting the four dimensions a priori, they
should have been retained and actual responses should have driven the
refinement of the construct. It can be argued, for instance, that serviceability is
an important aspect of product quality in the autoparts industry in terms of
product support offered by the supplier. Similarly, in a few products such as
seats or chrome trims, aesthetics could play a part in evaluating product quality. 
While it is hard to assess how the inclusion of these dimensions would have
affected the research results, we suspect it would have led to empirically
stronger relationships between implementation constructs and product quality.
Attention to details for improving product quality along the four (excluded)
dimensions, especially serviceability, features, and aesthetics should call for
higher levels of all implementation constructs. While the omission may have
affected the content validity of the construct to some extent, the relative

importance of the included dimensions still makes the current representations
of the construct meaningful. However, we strongly recommend inclusion of all
eight dimensions in any further studies using the product quality construct for
industrial as well as consumer products. The third limitation of the study
concerns multicollinearity of the constructs. As we stated before, it is not
surprising in survey research to find collinearity in the responses along various
dimensions. The major result of this collinearity is to potentially inflate the
standard errors of the regression coefficients, leading to a lack of significant
results in cases which otherwise might be significant. 

We suggest that care be taken not to overstate the implications of a lack of
significance  in  the  coefficients  in  our  model.  For  instance,  the  lack  of
significance of top management commitment in our model may be related to the
variable’s covariance with customer focus and empowerment. Thus, drawing
the conclusion that top management commitment is not related to product
quality is over-reaching our results. The primary reason why we pursued the
analysis of low versus high top management commitment firms was its often-
cited link to product. The same could be true for the other constructs for which
we found insignificant results. Future research should investigate in detail the
extent to which these constructs covary.

1-7 Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree, 4 = neutral and 7 = strongly agree. Items on all of the
TQM implementation constructs (except for the Supplier Quality Management Construct) asked
responses with respect to a primary product of the firm. Items on the Supplier Quality
Management construct asked responses with respect to a primary component in the primary
product. Items on the product quality scale compared the quality of the firm’s primary product
