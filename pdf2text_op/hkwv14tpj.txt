This study examined the degree to which employees had accurate perceptions
of how their supervisors would rate them on job performance (i.e., employ-
ees’ meta-accuracy). Employees and their supervisors from 140 dyads were
asked to complete measures assessing the supervisor’s assessment of the
employee’s job performance, from each of their perspectives. Results re-
vealed that employees’ meta-accuracy varied across different types of job
performance. Speciﬁcally, employees had relatively low meta-accuracy for
task and contextual performance and relatively high meta-accuracy for
innovative performance. The article closes with a discussion of the implica-
tions of the ﬁndings and their role in guiding relevant future research.

Keywords: metaperception, job performance, meta-accuracy

egy (Levy & Williams, 2004). Typically, in the feedback process, employees

Metaperceptions of Job Performance

receive performance ratings/assessments from their supervisors, and these
supervisor evaluations are widely believed to be crucial for employees’
performance improvement in the future (Cascio, 1991).

An implicit assumption underlying this strategy is that employees are
unaware of how their supervisors view them. This explicit feedback thus
serves to reveal to employees their supervisors’ assessments of them. Knowl-
edge of supervisors’ ratings also is thought to promote employees’ self-
awareness, thereby leading to insights about steps or actions to take for
performance improvement (Brett & Atwater, 2001).

In the organizational literature, the common approach for examining this
assumption of employee ignorance about how they are seen is to compare
employees’ self-ratings with their supervisor ratings (Yammarino & Atwater,
1997). A large discrepancy between these two types of ratings is generally
believed to be supporting evidence for this assumption. However, this ap-
proach could be faulty, as a discrepancy between self- and supervisor ratings
is not necessarily indicative of a corresponding true difference in appraisals.
The possibility exists that employees already possess a good sense of how
their supervisors will rate them, even though these ratings may be different
from their self-ratings.

Thus, understanding the degree to which performance feedback can
help ratees gain new perspectives would beneﬁt from comparing others’
(e.g., supervisors’) ratings to employees’ ratings of how they think those
others will rate them (i.e., employees’ metaperception ratings). Results
demonstrating that employees’ metaperception ratings are not signiﬁ-
cantly different from others’ ratings would cast signiﬁcant doubt on the
usefulness of performance feedback or, at a minimum, suggest that some
mechanism other than increased self-awareness is responsible for its
supposed beneﬁts. This is not to say that self– other discrepancies are
unimportant,
that people already may be aware of them before
receiving explicit feedback.

formance ratings was not examined in this study.

aforementioned questions. We begin with a description of relevant models
of metaperceptions and then integrate this metaperception research into
the performance feedback context in proposing the study hypotheses.

THE CONCEPT AND THEORETICAL MODELS OF

METAPERCEPTION

The process of understanding and controlling the social environment re-
quires not only perception of one’s own and others’ qualities but also accurate
perception of how one is viewed by others (Levesque, 1997). When people desire
to be viewed in certain ways, they are motivated to evaluate their success in
achieving this goal by considering the impressions they make on others (Al-
bright, Forest, & Reiseter, 2001; Elfenbein, Eisenkraft, & Ding, 2009). Individ-
uals’ perception of how they are seen by others is referred to as metaperception
(Laing, Phillipson, & Lee, 1966) in the social psychology literature (see Frey &
Tropp, 2006, Kenny & DePaulo, 1993, and Vorauer, 2006, for reviews).

Determining the processes underlying metaperception formation is a central
topic of investigation in metaperception research (Frey & Tropp, 2006; Kenny,
1994). Studies suggest that individuals derive these perceptions by relying on
several pieces of information. First, people may believe that others view them the
way they view themselves (Kenny & DePaulo, 1993). For instance, someone
implicitly may reason, “I regard myself as a worthy, valuable person [i.e.,
indicative of high self-esteem] and therefore others also see me as worthy and
valuable.”

However, such reliance on default self-views is likely attenuated in
evaluative situations when individuals are especially interested in or con-
cerned about how others view them (Santuzzi, 2007; Vorauer, 2006; Vorauer,
Main, & O’Connell, 1998). In such circumstances, where others’ evaluations
are especially salient and/or meaningful, people also rely on more context-
speciﬁc information (Kaplan, Santuzzi, & Ruscher, 2009).

According to Albright and Malloy’s (1999) direct observation model of
metaperception, this reliance on contextual information involves two steps.
The ﬁrst step is to determine what behaviors have been observed by others.
The second step is to infer what impression others will generate based on the
observation of those behaviors. An illustration of this model would be
employees carefully observing their own verbal and nonverbal behaviors and
trying to mind read their onlooking supervisor’s likely perceptions and
interpretations of those behaviors (see Ames, 2004).

Lastly, according to the feedback model of metaperception development
(Albright et al., 2001), individuals also tend to observe others’ reactions to their
behaviors when forming metaperceptions (Kenny & DePaulo, 1993; Shechtman
& Kenny, 1994). This model suggests that employees attend to other people’s
reactions to their behavior and form metaperceptions based on such feedback.
Unlike the direct observation model, the feedback model emphasizes observation
of reactionary behaviors from others rather than observation of one’s own
behavior.

Metaperceptions of Job Performance

33

In sum, research from outside the organizational realm suggests that
there are three processes implicated in metaperception formation. In a situ-
ation like the workplace, where metaperceptive concern may be especially
great, employees likely rely on all available information, integrating their
default self-views, observation of their own behavior, and feedback from
others (Ames, 2004; Frey & Tropp, 2006; Kaplan et al., 2009).

METAPERCEPTIVE ACCURACY

The other major focus of metaperception research is how accurate
individuals’ metaperceptions are (i.e., meta-accuracy). Substantial research
shows that meta-accuracy is fairly high in general (Kenny, 1994; Levesque,
1997), and is especially high in certain circumstances. In particular, meta-
accuracy tends to be quite high among well-acquainted individuals (e.g.,
family members and long-term friends; Carlson, Vazire, & Furr, 2011;
Levesque, 1997; Malloy, Albright, Kenny, Agatstein, & Winquist, 1997). In
addition, metaperceptions seem to be more accurate when people are delib-
erately attempting to create a desired impression. Speciﬁcally, Albright and
colleagues (2001) found that meta-accuracy can be very high among unac-
quainted people when individuals deliberately use strategies to inﬂuence
other people’s impressions of them.

The above ﬁndings potentially have signiﬁcant implications for the use
of performance feedback and also for understanding the mechanisms that do
or do not transmit its potentially beneﬁcial effects. In the following para-
graphs, we borrow from the metaperception research in proposing if and
when meta-accuracy might be higher or lower, and, by implication, when the
usefulness of performance feedback for engendering self-awareness may be
greater or lesser.

Metaperceptive Accuracy for Job Performance

In general, we would expect meta-accuracy with regard to performance
ratings to be fairly high. As discussed above, empirical evidence indicates
that people generally are quite proﬁcient in determining how they are judged
by others, especially during long-term relationships and when people have
the intention of impacting others’ impressions.

For the most part, both of these conditions should hold with regard to
employee–supervisor relationships. That is, most employees spend at least a
moderate amount of time behaving around their supervisors (Mintzberg,
1990) and also often behave in deliberate ways to create favorable supervisor

impressions in others (e.g., their supervisors; Harris, Kacmar, Zivnuska, &
Shaw, 2007). Creating desired images requires attending to one’s own
behaviors as well as to others’ reactions to those behaviors to determine
effectiveness in creating that desired image. Thus, based on the above
discussion of metaperception formation and meta-accuracy, employees
should develop metaperceptions that achieve fairly high levels of meta-
accuracy.

One area of organizational research that directly considers the relation
between employee and other’s agreement relating to performance domains is
that of multisource performance feedback or 360° feedback systems (Atwater
& Yammarino, 1995). In this form of feedback, employees examine ratings
from not only their supervisor but also their coworkers, subordinates, and
customers. Typically, the literature on 360° feedback focuses on discrepan-
cies between self- and other ratings (Atkins & Wood, 2002). From a meta-
perception perspective, these discrepancies are no longer considered a nui-
sance, because they could be reconciled by considering metaperception
ratings instead of self-ratings. Consistent with these ideas, Schoorman and
Mayer (2007), in one of the few studies looking at performance-related
metaperception (metaperceptive ratings of overall job performance and 10
managerial roles), found a higher level of self–supervisor rating correspon-
dence when employees were asked to adopt their supervisor’s perspective
than when making self-ratings.

Metaperceptive Accuracy Across Performance Dimensions

Despite this conclusion that meta-accuracy should be fairly strong in
general, metaperception research also suggests that meta-accuracy will differ
as a function of the behaviors (i.e., type of performance) being evaluated. In
the present study, we examine three particular aspects of job performance,
namely, task, contextual, and innovative performance. We chose these three
performance dimensions because they differ in ways that should translate into
greater or lesser meta-accuracy. Below, we ﬁrst brieﬂy describe these dimen-
sions and subsequently discuss proposed (differences in) meta-accuracy for
the three dimensions.

Task, Contextual, and Innovative Performance

A considerable amount of research documents that job performance is
more than just task performance (e.g., Borman, White, & Dorsey, 1995;
Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994; Van Scotter & Motowidlo, 1996). The

distinction between task performance and contextual performance made by
Borman and Motowidlo (1993) has received widespread acceptance in the
organizational literature (e.g., Conway, 1999; Van Scotter & Motowidlo,
1996). Borman and Motowidlo (1993) deﬁned task and contextual perfor-
mance based on characteristics of the constituent behaviors. Task perfor-
mance refers to core technical behaviors that are involved in creating prod-
ucts or services (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993). In contrast, contextual
performance refers to non-job-speciﬁc behaviors that support the social
environment in which technical activities are performed (Borman & Moto-
widlo, 1993). Examples of contextual performance include helping cowork-
ers in their work and working for extra hours without being asked.

A third dimension of job performance is innovative performance. The
recent focus on innovative performance has coincided with the increasing
(recognition of the) importance of innovation for organizational survival and
success (e.g., Janssen, van de Vliert, & West, 2004; Woodman, Sawyer, &
Grifﬁn, 1993). Innovative performance involves generating, promoting, and
implementing novel and practical ideas for products and services, and these
behaviors are viewed as being directly related to the work outcome (Ander-
son, De Dreu, & Nijstad, 2004; Janssen, 2001; West & Farr, 1990). Common
examples of innovative performance include developing new work methods
and applying new technologies at work.

Worth noting is that innovative performance may overlap with both task
performance and contextual performance. For example, the current research
focuses on R&D (i.e., research and development) employees whose jobs
necessitate innovation in successful task completion (Oldham & Cummings,
1996; Thompson & Heron, 2006). For these employees, their innovative
performance is likely to overlap with their task performance. In addition,
given that innovative performance includes promoting and advocating new
ideas (Anderson et al., 2004; Janssen, 2001), employees’ innovative perfor-
mance may help build a creative work environment and therefore can be seen
as a form of contextual performance. Although innovative performance is not
a completely separate performance dimension, we examine it here in addition
to the other two performance dimensions for two reasons. First, previous
research (e.g., Janssen, 2001) shows that innovative job performance only has
modest correlation with task performance, suggesting that they reﬂect dif-
ferent aspects of job performance. Second, we expect that employees have
higher meta-accuracy for innovative performance compared with the other
two types of performance. Our general prediction is that meta-accuracy
should be higher for innovative than for task performance, which, in turn,
should be higher than that for contextual performance (i.e.,
innovative
performance ⬎ task performance ⬎ contextual performance). We begin by
discussing meta-accuracy for contextual performance, the dimension for
which we propose meta-accuracy should be lowest.

Metaperceptive Accuracy for Contextual Performance

We anticipate meta-accuracy being lowest for contextual performance
for several reasons. First, employees’ contextual performance may be less
obvious to supervisors than are task and innovative performance. Certain
contextual behaviors are not very observable (e.g., cheerleading, peacekeep-
ing; Organ, Podsakoff, & MacKenzie, 2006) and thus supervisors are un-
likely to notice much of this prosocial behavior. Subordinates, meanwhile,
should be less aware of exactly which or how much of their contextual
behavior is apparent to their supervisors. In many cases, supervisors primar-
ily may learn about their subordinates’ contextual performance through
indirect means (e.g., information from other employees). According to the
direct observation model of metaperception (Albright & Malloy, 1999),
employees’ lack of knowledge regarding the behaviors that are available to
supervisors will hinder the employees’ capacity to generate accurate meta-
perceptions.

Second, even when employees’ contextual performance is easily observ-
able, supervisors may not attend to, and take account of, these contextual
behaviors, a fact that employees may or may not be aware of. Indirect support
for this notion comes from Conway’s (1999) ﬁnding that supervisors paid
less attention to contextual behaviors than did colleagues. This lack of
supervisory recognition may be a result of supervisors simply not caring as
much about these behaviors (Borman et al., 1995; Conway, 1999). Although
some supervisors do seem to heavily weigh and consider these behaviors,
others do not (Borman & Motowidlo, 1997). In addition, Morrison (1994)
found that employees and supervisors hold different views of what consti-
tutes extrarole performance. Thus, even if employees know which contextual
behaviors are accessible to their supervisors, the employees may have difﬁ-
culty in trying to infer the extent to which supervisors take account of these
behaviors. Based on the direct observation model of metaperception (Al-
bright & Malloy, 1999), this lack of knowledge of how others will react to
ones’ behaviors will further limit meta-accuracy. Related to this idea, em-
ployees are less likely to receive explicit feedback on contextual performance
compared with core job performance. Thus, according to the feedback model
of metaperception, this relatively small amount of feedback about past
contextual performance should further weaken meta-accuracy. Taken
together, because contextual performance is oftentimes less observable,
and is formally recognized and rewarded less (Smith, Organ, & Near,
1983; Van Scotter, Motowidlo, & Cross, 2000), we expect, on the basis
of the direct observation and feedback models of metaperception, that
employees should have inaccurate metaperceptive ratings for contextual
performance.

Metaperceptions of Job Performance

37

Before offering a formal hypothesis about this notion, a brief explanation
of the present index of meta-accuracy is warranted. In the current study, we
operationalize meta-(in)accuracy as the paired mean difference between
metaperceptions and the supervisors’ ratings. According to this operational-
ization, a smaller difference between metaperception ratings and supervisory
ratings is indicative of greater meta-accuracy. This discrepancy approach is
one of the two most common methods of assessing agreement in studies of
self– other agreement of performance ratings, the other being computing the
correlation between self- and supervisor ratings (see the meta-analytic review
by Heidemeier & Moser, 2009).

We chose this discrepancy approach because the dyads in the current
study were independent, in that each supervisor rated only one employee, and
each employee made metaperception ratings about that unique supervisor’s
view of him or her. Because neither rater in each dyad was necessarily using
the other employees in the sample as a referent in making ratings, using the
correlation coefﬁcient does not seem justiﬁed, given that it is based on rank
order. Instead, an approach that compares absolute (vs. relative) judgments of
performance seems more appropriate. With this point in mind, we offer the
ﬁrst hypothesis following from the rationale above.

Hypothesis 1: For contextual performance, employees’ metaperception
ratings will be signiﬁcantly different from supervisor ratings.

Meta-Accuracy of Task and Innovative Performance Compared With That

of Contextual Performance

In contrast to contextual performance, meta-accuracy for task and inno-
vative performance should be relatively strong, for at least two reasons. First,
because task and innovative performance entail more explicit expectations
and are associated with more observable behaviors and outcomes (Katz &
Kahn, 1966; Woodman et al., 1993) compared with contextual performance,
employees should be aware of the information that others (supervisors in the
current study) will utilize in making their ratings. As discussed above, the
direct observation model of metaperception suggests that the derivation of
metaperceptions entails the two stages of determining which information
(e.g., behavior) is available to others and then determining how others will
interpret and react to that information (Albright & Malloy, 1999). Because
employees’ effectiveness in their core job tasks and in generating innovative
solutions should be relatively salient to both employees and their supervisors,
both members of the dyad should use very similar information in making
ratings, manifesting in greater meta-accuracy.

Second, performance on these two dimensions, and especially task
performance, is linked to prior feedback and personnel decisions (Ilgen &
Davis, 2000). Thus, compared with contextual performance, employees
should have more access to their supervisors’ past judgments of their effec-
tiveness on these two performance dimensions and of how the supervisor
makes these ratings (e.g., which behaviors the supervisor weighs more or less
heavily). Thus, consistent with the feedback model of metaperception, meta-
accuracy should be higher because employees know how their supervisors
have judged them in the past. Based on these ideas, the following predictions
seem warranted.

Hypothesis 2: Employees’ meta-accuracy on task performance will be
higher than that on contextual job performance.

Hypothesis 3: Employees’ meta-accuracy on innovative performance
will be higher than that on contextual performance.

Meta-Accuracy of Task Versus Innovative Performance

As noted, past research shows that innovative job performance is mod-
estly correlated with task performance, indicating that they reﬂect different
elements of job performance (Janssen, 2001). In terms of meta-accuracy, we
expect that employees should have more accurate metaperceptive ratings for
innovative performance than for task performance. Among all three perfor-
mance dimensions, innovative performance should be the dimension for
which behavioral cues are most salient to both the employee and supervisor.
As such, employees and their supervisors should rely on largely the same
discrete, although limited, pieces of information in making their respective
ratings (Ashford & Northcraft, 1992; Rotundo & Sackett, 2002). According
to the direct observation model of metaperception, use of the same behavioral
information should result in relatively high levels of meta-accuracy. Indirect
support for this prediction comes from Furnham and Stringﬁeld’s (1994)
ﬁnding that, among the six managerial performance dimensions, innovation
has the highest self–supervisor agreement and subordinate–supervisor agree-
ment. Based on this ﬁnding and the rationale above, we offer the following
hypothesis.

Hypothesis 4: Employees’ meta-accuracy on innovative performance
will be higher than that on task performance.

Metaperceptions of Job Performance

39

METHOD

Participants

To test these hypotheses, we conducted a ﬁeld study in which supervi-
sor–subordinate dyads were recruited to provide performance ratings. A total
of 169 supervisor–subordinate dyads from a Chinese high-tech company
responded to a survey containing measures of three types of job performance.
The surveys were directly distributed by the research team. All participants
were working in the company’s research and development department.
Subordinates’ main job duty was to design new high-tech products. Although
their supervisors also need to engage in research and development, they were
mainly responsible for overseeing their direct reports. The subordinates and
their supervisors worked together closely and interacted frequently.

During the recruiting process, we ﬁrst contacted all supervisors in the
department and asked whether they would like to participate in our research.
Then, we randomly located one subordinate for each supervisor and asked
this subordinate whether he or she would be willing to participate. Partici-
pants completed surveys during normal work hours in their own ofﬁces or
cubicles without other people being present. Then they returned the surveys
to the researcher, who was waiting in the conference room. This data
collection effort was permitted in the organization because of one research-
er’s personal connection with the company.

The overall response rates were 87.6% for supervisors and 95.3% for
subordinates. Given that the analyses required ratings from both parties, we
discarded cases in which only one individual in the dyad provided responses.
Doing so resulted in a total of 140 usable supervisor–subordinate dyads. Of
these 140 subordinates, 34 (24.3%) were women. With respect to the age of
these subordinates, 47 (33.6%) were under 30 years old, 84 (60.0%) were in
their 30s, eight (5.7%) were in their 40s, and one (0.7%) was above 50. All
participants were Chinese.

Measures

Subordinates indicated how they thought their supervisor would rate
them on three types of job performance: task performance, contextual per-
formance, and innovative job performance. The instructions for metapercep-
tion ratings were, “The following items can be used to describe your view of
your direct supervisor’s assessment of your job performance. Please rate the
degree to which they correctly reﬂect your actual view of your supervisor’s
evaluation of your work performance.”

Supervisors were asked to rate their subordinates on the same three
performance measures. They were informed that the ratings were solely for
research purposes and would be conﬁdential (i.e., not shared with subordi-
nates). All participants were unaware of the purpose of the study. All
measures used a 6-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to
strongly agree.

Back-translation was used to ensure equivalence of the measure in
Chinese and English languages (Brislin, 1980). That is, all scales were
translated into Chinese and then translated independently back into English.
In addition, expert judges checked all measures for their interpretability in
Chinese.

Task Performance

Podsakoff and MacKenzie’s (1989) ﬁve-item measure was used to assess
task performance (e.g., “This worker fulﬁlls all responsibilities required by
his or her job”). This scale measures employees’ in-role performance (Jans-
sen, 2001) and shows satisfactory discriminant validity with measures as-
sessing contextual performance (Podsakoff & MacKenzie, 1989). The coef-
ﬁcient alpha for this scale was .85 for both metaperception ratings and
supervisor ratings.

Contextual Performance

Motowidlo and Van Scotter’s (1994) 16-item measure was used to
evaluate contextual performance. Aryee, Sun, Chen, and Debrah (2008)
validated this measure in the Chinese population, so we used the Chinese
version of this measure. This scale assesses two subdimensions of contextual
performance: interpersonal facilitation (e.g., “support or encourage a co-
worker with a personal problem”) and job dedication (e.g., “put in extra hours
to get work done on time”). This measure has demonstrated satisfactory
construct validity in previous research (e.g., Motowidlo & Van Scotter,
1994). For example, contextual performance assessed by this measure pre-
dicts overall performance above and beyond task performance (Motowidlo &
Van Scotter, 1994). In addition, contextual performance measured by this
scale correlates with personality variables more highly than does task per-
formance (Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994). In the current study, coefﬁcient
alphas for these two subdimensions were .84 and .88 for metaperception
ratings, and .85 and .91 for supervisor ratings, respectively.

Metaperceptions of Job Performance

Innovative Job Performance

Scott and Bruce’s (1994) nine-item measure was used to assess innova-
tive job performance. This measure assesses three subdimensions of innova-
tive job performance: idea generation (e.g., “creating new ideas for improve-
ments”), idea promotion (e.g., “mobilizing support for innovative ideas”),
and idea realization (e.g., “evaluating the utility of innovate ideas”). Each
subdimension is measured by three items. Scott and Bruce (1994) showed
that innovative performance assessed by this scale is related to leadership,
support for innovation, managerial role expectations, career stage, and prob-
lem-solving style. In this study, coefﬁcient alphas for each subdimension of
the scale were .89, .85, and .84 for metaperception ratings, and .89, .89, and
.85 for supervisor ratings, respectively.

RESULTS

Because the two subdimensions of contextual performance were highly
correlated (metaperception ratings: r ⫽ .61, p ⬍ .01; supervisor ratings: r ⫽
.65, p ⬍ .01), and the pattern of the following results was identical for the two
subdimensions, we combined the two dimensions in conducting the primary
analyses. The same was true for innovative job performance (metaperception
ratings: correlations among the three subdimensions are .63, .67, .74, p ⬍ .01;
supervisor ratings: correlations among the three subdimensions are .66, .62,
.69, p ⬍ .01). Table 1 contains the means, standard deviations, and correla-
tions for the study variables.

As shown in Table 1, for both metaperception ratings and supervisor
ratings, the three performance dimensions demonstrated relatively high in-
tercorrelations. Therefore, conﬁrmatory factor analysis was conducted to
assess the discriminant validity of these performance dimensions. We com-
pared the three-factor model with a one-factor model for the two types of
ratings, respectively. Results showed that the three-factor model ﬁt the data

signiﬁcantly better than the one-factor model for both types of ratings
(metaperception: ␹2[3]⫽ 487.47, p ⬍ .001; supervisor: ␹2[3] ⫽ 814.99, p ⬍
.001), indicating the distinctiveness of these three performance dimensions.
Hypotheses 1 concerned meta-accuracy for contextual performance.
Paired sample t tests were conducted to test this hypothesis. Hypothesis 1
predicts that employees’ metaperception ratings for contextual performance
should be signiﬁcantly different from supervisors’ ratings. This prediction
was supported, as metaperception ratings on contextual performance were
signiﬁcantly lower than supervisory ratings, t(139) ⫽ 2.71, p ⬍ .01, average
mean difference ⫽ .17. Although we did not offer corresponding hypotheses
about the other dimensions, we also conducted t tests comparing the two
types of ratings for task and innovative performance. Similar to contextual
performance, results showed that supervisory ratings were signiﬁcantly
higher than metaperception ratings for task performance, t(139) ⫽ 3.37, p ⬍
.01, average mean difference ⫽ .21. In contrast, the means for the two sets
of ratings were extremely similar for innovative performance, t(139) ⫽ .60,
p ⬎ .05, average mean difference ⫽ .00. This ﬁnding is consistent with our
prediction that innovative performance should demonstrate the highest meta-
accuracy.

Hypotheses 2 to 4 were direct tests of the notion that meta-accuracy
would vary across the different performance dimensions. Although the above
results are suggestive of such differential meta-accuracy, analyses speciﬁ-
cally testing this issue provide for stronger conclusions. To test Hypotheses
2 to 4, we compared mean difference scores across the performance dimen-
sions using paired sample t tests. Contrary to Hypothesis 2, meta-accuracy
did not signiﬁcantly differ for task performance versus contextual perfor-
mance, t(139) ⫽ .80, p ⬎ .05. However, results did reveal that meta-accuracy
on innovative job performance was higher than meta-accuracy on contextual
performance, t(139) ⫽ 3.09, p ⬍ .05, and on task performance, t(139) ⫽
2.02, p ⬍ .05. Thus, Hypotheses 3 and 4 were supported. These ﬁndings
clearly show that meta-accuracy was strongest for innovative performance.

DISCUSSION

This research examined the degree to which employees have accurate
views of how they are viewed at work and, by implication, how useful efforts
to increase that meta-accuracy, such as performance feedback, really might
be. In our view, perhaps the most striking ﬁnding from this study was that
employees generally demonstrated lower levels of meta-accuracy than antic-
ipated, especially on those performance dimensions that oftentimes are the
most signiﬁcant—task and contextual performance. As shown in Table 1, the

Metaperceptions of Job Performance

magnitude of the discrepancies between metaperception and supervisory
ratings for these dimensions was sizable, approaching one-third standard-
deviation difference in the two sets of ratings. Contrary to our prediction,
these ﬁndings suggest that employees generally may have poor insight into
other people’s opinions about their work-related performance.

We based our prediction that employees generally would demonstrate
high meta-accuracy on metaperception research from social psychology.
Although we only can speculate about why meta-accuracy in the current
study was lower than that generally reported in social psychology studies,
one reasonable explanation pertains to differences in the content of the
metaperceptions in these two domains.

The more basic social psychology research has primarily focused upon
metaperceptions regarding personality traits and interpersonal liking (e.g.,
how much people think others like them; Carlson, Furr, & Vazire, 2010;
Kenny & DePaulo, 1993). In contrast, performance ratings, at least in part,
reﬂect employees’ discrete behaviors (Borman, White, Pulakos, & Oppler,
1991). Work on self– other agreement in these ratings suggests that employ-
ees and their supervisors often differentially consider and/or weigh speciﬁc
behaviors and have different views regarding what constitutes effective
performance (Conway, 1999). To the extent that the same phenomena operate
with respect to metaperceptions of performance, meta-accuracy will suffer
and be lower than that for other types of judgments.

The present ﬁndings regarding the differential meta-accuracy for the
various performance dimensions are consistent with this rationale. These
results demonstrated that meta-accuracy was higher for innovative perfor-
mance than for task or contextual performance. Consistent with the notion
presented above, a likely explanation for this ﬁnding is that speciﬁc examples
of innovation are especially obvious and accessible to both subordinates and
supervisors as they provide their ratings, thereby leading the ratings to be
more similar. If this rationale is correct, it implies that supervisory ratings of
innovation are also more accurate in an absolute sense (i.e., are “truer”). This
notion that mutual observation of salient events largely drives meta-accuracy
has several implications. Although such meta-accuracy generally is desirable,
the greater salience of discrete (innovative) events also suggests that super-
visors may rely too heavily on particular discrete events when providing
ratings (Lee & Dalal, 2011). Future work on this possibility seems warranted.
In addition, this notion implies that meta-accuracy will increase with the
number of opportunities for employees and their supervisors to observe the
same salient events. Put differently, meta-accuracy should be especially high
for the jobs in which the frequency and criticality of discrete events and
outcomes is relatively high and central to the job. In the current study,
innovation was an integral job component, given that these were research and
development workers (Yuan & Woodman, 2010). In jobs for which innova-

tion is less important, we would expect meta-accuracy to be lower than it was
here. Along a similar vein, for jobs in which other performance dimensions
with discrete behaviors—such as counterproductive behaviors (Borman et al.,
1991) or detection of threats (Kaplan, Stachowski, Hawkins, & Kurtessis,
2010)—are more central, meta-accuracy should be higher for those dimen-
sions.

Clearly, though, this theoretical account for the present ﬁndings is
speculative, and the study did not address it directly. Several alternative
theoretical explanations for these ﬁndings exist. For example, instead of the
results (only) being due to differences on the concreteness of the respective
behaviors, employees and their supervisors may hold different expectations
about, or motivations for, their ratings in the three dimensions. For instance,
employees may be most motivated to attend to supervisors’ reactions for
tasks most central to their job (creative tasks here) and on which their
performance is formally evaluated. Another explanation is that correspon-
dence is highest for tasks on which employees receive the most concrete
feedback—which may be creative ones. Yet another possibility is that con-
vergence is greatest for narrower categories of behavior. Again, this result
would seem consistent with the stronger correspondence for innovative
versus task or contextual performance. As this sampling of explanations
make clear, the present results should stimulate further inquiry on underlying
metaperception mechanisms, rather than be seen as providing conclusive
answers about them.

Beyond recommending studies on metaperception development, we also
would call, more generally, for research integrating metaperceptions into
established management topics and frameworks. To date, metaperception
research in the organizational domain is limited in amount and focus (the few
existing article we could locate include King, Kaplan, & Zaccaro, 2008, and
Schoorman & Mayer, 2007). However, metaperception research potentially
could stimulate new questions and insights into topics including impression
management, feedback seeking, applicant behaviors and reactions, coworker
and leader–member relations, and performance appraisal. In addition, as
noted in the beginning of the article, integrating metaperceptions into 360°
feedback research and practice would seem especially useful. The current
analysis showing employees’ task performance metaperceptions differ from
their supervisors’ perceptions provides compelling evidence for the existence
of diverging self- versus supervisory views. As such, these results point to the
need to try to reduce these discrepancies through practices like 360° feed-
back.

In addition to these conceptual contributions, the present ﬁndings also
have some practical implications. The relatively low levels of meta-accuracy
indicate that self-awareness of performance could be increased. Consistent
with the rationale for its use (Smither, London, & Reilly, 2005), performance

feedback may be one strategy to enhance that awareness. The current results
also speak to when performance feedback may be of greatest use in achieving
that goal. Speciﬁcally, these ﬁndings suggest that it would be especially
beneﬁcial for task and contextual performance. Another limitation of the
present ﬁndings is in respect to the sample of research and development
employees. Although we found high levels of meta-accuracy for innovative
performance for these employees, this performance dimension is highly
salient to these employees and their supervisors. Future research should
determine whether these ﬁndings are generalizable to other job types. A ﬁnal
point that warrants mention with regard to these results is that the sample for
this study was composed of non-Western employees from China. In our view,
this is more of a potential boundary condition than a limitation, given that
China is a crucial part of the global economy and that understanding orga-
nizational phenomena in China is becoming increasingly important (Ralston,
Gustafson, Elsass, Cheung, & Terpstra, 1992). In addition, from an interna-
tional business perspective, there is an emerging research focus on “how to
operate and compete in China” (Luo & Nord, 2005), seeing as it is the
world’s largest host of foreign direct investment. A sufﬁcient understanding
of Chinese employees’ perceptions and behaviors is crucial for foreign
company’s success in China (Wu, 2008). Although we cannot deﬁnitively
conclude to what degree these ﬁndings will generalize to a Western context,
we would expect that the desire for, and process of, forming metaperceptions
is largely universal. Consistent with this assertion is a recent study using
Chinese samples that revealed similar metaperception patterns as those
identiﬁed by Western researchers (Ho & Chau, 2009).

In sum, this study demonstrated that employees have relatively low
meta-accuracy for task and contextual performance, and, by implication, that
efforts to increase this meta-accuracy (such as performance feedback) are
warranted. However, the current ﬁndings also show that employees have
accurate metaperceptive ratings for innovative performance, indicating that
performance feedback may only have limited use for the type of performance
that consists of discrete and salient events.
