Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the value-relevance of corporate reputation during times of crisis. The paper seeks to extend the
view beyond the traditional focus on the cognitive component of reputation, shed light on its affective component, and integrate the perceptions of
different stakeholder groups.
Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses two large-scale surveys, one from before and one from after the ﬁnancial crisis year of 2008, to
ascertain the reputation evaluations of the largest publicly listed corporations in Germany. The paper employs a model augmented with standard
accounting variables (i.e. sales, return on assets, etc.) to analyse the link between corporate reputation as noted by different stakeholder groups and
future ﬁrm value.
Findings – Even though corporations are not able to elude the overall negative impact of an economic crisis, the magnitude of inﬂuence depends on
the individual ﬁrm dynamics as related to the ﬁrm’s reputation. In particular, ﬁrm value dynamics are signiﬁcantly associated with a reputation’s
affective component as perceived by the general public and its cognitive component as perceived by opinion leaders.
Research limitations/implications – The paper analyses only very large corporations in Germany over a limited period of time.
Practical implications – Managers cannot inﬂuence the course of a trans-national crisis, but they can immunise their company against its impacts by
managing ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial drivers of ﬁrm reputation within the various stakeholder groups.
Originality/value – The paper extends previous research on the value-relevance of corporate reputation by exploring the roles of different stakeholder
groups’ perceptions of the affective and cognitive component of reputation.

Financial crisis 5 reputation crisis?

The ﬁnancial crisis that began in 2008 had many unforeseen
consequences for stock markets all around the world. In
particular, we ﬁnd evidence that companies’ market values
were substantially less reliant on intangible assets during the
start of the ﬁnancial crisis. While the percentage of intangible
assets in terms of market capitalisation (proxied by the
market-to-book ratio of, for example, Germany’s top publicly
listed corporations) was about 70 per cent between 1990 and
2007, it fell to less than 40 per cent in 2008 (Schwaiger et al.,
2009). This is a strong indication of how investors’ credit in
the future proﬁt and growth potential of companies has
suffered. These concerns about the stability and magnitude of
future cash ﬂows may have been caused by events like the
Lehman Brothers collapse, the Madoff investment scandal, or
the sales collapse in the car sector, which have severely
damaged trust in top executives and their ability to manage
their companies clear-sightedly (Podolny, 2009).

Against

this backdrop,

the research question arises of
whether corporate reputation – generally understood as the
overall evaluation by various stakeholders (Fombrun, 1996)
and assumed to be an intangible asset crucial
the
performance and long-term success of a corporation (Hall,
1992) – may help to explain this destruction of the intangible
value of corporations. In particular, companies who were able
to protect their corporate reputation from erosion or even
improve their reputation level might have been less affected by
the negative impact of the ﬁnancial crisis on ﬁrm value
(Sarstedt, 2009). Using a sample of the largest publicly listed
corporations in Germany pooled in the DAX as a leading
stock market index (see www.dax-indices.com/EN), this study
examines the value-relevance of corporate reputation during
the climax of the ﬁnancial crisis in 2008.

However, this task raises some issues concerning the
operationalisation of corporate reputation. Many corporate
reputation measures have limitations. Often,
they are
predominantly focused on the cognitive aspects of corporate
reputation and correspondingly suppress its affective aspects
(Fryxell and Wang, 1994). Additionally, many measures
overweight a limited respondent pool, relying solely on experts
(Fombrun et al., 2000). To shed some new light on these issues,
we apply a measurement approach that considers both the
cognitive and the affective component of corporate reputation

including analysts, journalists, politicians, economic leaders,
economists, and representatives of NGOs/NPOs.

First, we introduce our conceptual framework and derive
our hypotheses. Then, we present our model and discuss the
results obtained. We ﬁnish this article by presenting
managerial
implications and providing our perspective on
future research directions.

2. Theoretical background

2.1 Impact of corporate reputation
Firms compete for reputation because of its strong signalling
effect, which inﬂuences the attitudes, decisions and behaviours
of stakeholders (Frooman, 1999; Shapiro, 1983). A good
reputation can serve as a signal of the superior quality and
reliability of products or services and improve the efﬁciency of
marketing efforts. Perceived risks associated with customer
buying decisions are reduced, which positively inﬂuences buying
intentions (Yoon et al., 1993). An excellent reputation can
increase customer trust in buying decisions made, which
reduces post-purchase dissonance and leads to increased
customer satisfaction and loyalty (Lafferty and Goldsmith,
1999). Simultaneously, the ﬁrm should be able to sell services
and products with price premiums (Klein and Lefﬂer, 1981;
Shapiro, 1983). In the recruiting market, potential employees
will be much more attracted to ﬁrms with a good reputation
(Caminiti, 1992); later, they may even be willing to work harder
for a lower amount of compensation and less prone to
enticement efforts on the part of competitors (Roberts and
Dowling, 2002). In supplier markets, negotiation, contracting,
and monitoring costs may be lower for either party. Additionally,
access to capital markets can be easier when investors’ belief in
the reliability and creditworthiness of ﬁrms with a good
reputation is stronger (Beatty and Ritter, 1986). This attracts
investors and enables a ﬁrm to charge higher issue prices (Sobol
et al., 1992).

Reputation is extremely difﬁcult

to imitate because it
cannot be bought like patents or copyrights (Caruana, 1997;
Hunt and Morgan, 1995). It takes a long time to build up a
good reputation, but such a reputation is very fragile because
it can be damaged very easily overnight (Hall, 1993).
Therefore,

Hence, a good corporate reputation should increase
competitiveness. In fact, researchers such as Dunbar and
Schwalbach (2002), Eberl and Schwaiger (2005), Fombrun
and Shanley (1990), Luchs et al. (2009), McGuire et al.
(1990), and Roberts and Dowling (2002) have shown how
persistent and superior ﬁnancial performance among ﬁrms is
created through good reputation in terms of, for instance,
higher returns on assets, net income or quality of earnings.

scarce

If a better reputation creates incremental cash ﬂows,
investors can be assumed to reward ﬁrms with a superior
reputation. This means that they should buy their stocks
based on their predictions regarding which ﬁrms will be
capable of converting their better reputation into incremental
cash ﬂows in the future.

capitalisation (i.e. market value), is a representation of the
ﬁnancial market’s (i.e. investors’) expectations regarding the
sum of the ﬁrm’s discounted future cash ﬂows (Mizik and
Jacobson, 2003). Because these heterogeneous expectations
are not stable and change over time, market values (i.e. stock
prices) and market-to-book ratios increase or decrease. The

(Greyser, 2009)

For example, such a relevant event might occur when a car
manufacturer calls for taxpayer money during a ﬁnancial crisis
in order to prevent its collapse because it is not able to handle
the requirements of a changing environment. Stakeholders
might interpret this as a kind of corporate misbehaviour
alongside product

customers’ belief
they are buying superior-quality
products and services. Consequently, we should observe the
negative effects on corporate reputation driven by product
quality among other
things (Schwaiger, 2004). Because
customers refrain from doing business with these less
reputable enterprises,
these
companies will become much more vulnerable. Investors
can be assumed to anticipate these kinds of effects and adapt
their expectations about future ﬁrm value accordingly.

the future cash ﬂows of

that

Additionally, if a ﬁrm is able to protect its corporate reputation
from erosion (e.g. during a crisis) or even improve its level of
reputation, this ﬁrm should be rewarded by investors because
they should use reputation as a risk-reducing signal and
anticipate the positive effects of a better reputation (Sarstedt,
2009). Thus, a good reputation can serve as a “kind of buffer in
times of crisis” (Jones et al., 2000), and the loss of ﬁrm value
caused by the ﬁnancial crisis is lower in magnitude than that
experienced by companies that have not previously been able to
build up that kind of reputational cushion.

However, it is impossible to collect information about all
reputation-relevant events and measure their direct effect on
ﬁrm value. Therefore, we use the differences between levels of
corporate reputation before and after the ﬁnancial crisis year
of 2008 as an aggregate measure of the combined effect of all
events that might have had either a positive or a negative effect
on perceived corporate reputation. We assume that
this
aggregated measure (and thus corporate reputation) is value-
relevant and adds incremental information beyond traditional
measures like top- and bottom-line ﬁnancial performance,
which are also linked to the expected future ﬁrm value.
Hence, we assume that changes in corporate reputation are
positively linked to changes in expected future ﬁrm value
during the same period. This assertion leads us to the
following central research hypothesis:

2.2 Investors’ expectations of future ﬁrm value
Consequently, corporate reputation should be positively
linked to the (expected) future value of a ﬁrm. Against this
backdrop, we focus on the ratio of market value to book value

H1. Corporate reputation is value-relevant — i.e. corporate
reputation explains a signiﬁcant proportion of the
variance in investors’ expectations about future ﬁrm
value.

3.1 Components of reputation
Even though there is a widely accepted view of corporate
reputation as “a global perception of the extent to which an
organisation is held in high esteem or regard” (Weiss et al.,
1999, p. 75), the concrete deﬁnitions of the construct of
corporate reputation vary considerably (Schwaiger, 2004;
Walker, 2010; Walsh and Beatty, 2007). This fact creates a
major problem for measurement. To avoid drawing the wrong
conclusions
corporate
reputation, we must consider this debate to assure the
appropriate conceptualisation and operationalisation of
corporate reputation. At ﬁrst, it is important to distinguish
corporate reputation from other
related constructs like
identity and image. Brown et al. (2006) provide clear
terminology for the concepts that we will refer to in this study:
.
“Identity” can be deﬁned as the internal view – the
organisation’s
reputation
comprises the external view – the stakeholder’s (actual)
view of the organisation in question.
“Image” can be seen as an intended or desired external
view: how the company wants to be perceived by its
stakeholders.

self-perception – whereas

.

Therefore, reputation is based on external perceptions over
time and resembles what Balmer (2002) calls “conceived”
identity.

that

Most of the popular measures are not based on scientiﬁcally
well founded operationalisations of corporate reputation as a
latent variable and over-weight the cognitive aspect (Fombrun
et al., 2000; Sobol et al., 1992). These approaches mainly rely
on ﬁnancial components, ignoring other potential aspects of
corporate reputation (e.g. Fombrun et al., 2000; Fryxell and
Wang, 1994; Hutton, 1986). The associated competence or
“expertise” of a company is indubitably one important
component of corporate reputation. However, people tend to
anthropomorphise organisations (Fombrun, 1996). Findings
from consumer research reveal
in many situations,
people’s “feeling-right experience” causes them to attribute
higher value to anthropomorphised objects, and therefore
affects their attitudes towards these objects (Wang and Lee,
2006). Even though the management’s expertise at a
company might be outstanding, stakeholders might have a
gut feeling that there is something “bad” associated with the
ﬁrm. This may create dislike or discomfort and, consequently,
challenge the effort to build up a close relationship between
the stakeholders and the ﬁrm. Therefore, reputation must be
assumed to be an attitudinal construct
in the sense of
Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) – i.e.
the
stakeholders
the organisation and attitudinal
constructs generally are assumed to have an affective and
a cognitive component (Schwaiger, 2004). Consequently,
corporate reputation is formed by the emotions and the
knowledge of individuals. Corporate communications and
corporate behaviour, as well as the individuals’ direct personal
experiences,
inﬂuence these aspects. Consequently, we
conceptualise corporate reputation as a construct consisting
of an affective component (hereafter,
likeability) and a
cognitive component (hereafter, competence) (Schwaiger,
2004). Thus, our research extends the results of the majority
of previous studies, which have usually seen corporate
reputation as a unidimensional construct.

becomes more differentiated:

H1a. The cognitive component of corporate reputation
(competence) is value-relevant – i.e. competence is
positively associated with investors’ expectations
about future ﬁrm value.
The affective component of corporate reputation
(likeability) is value-relevant – i.e.
likeability is
positively associated with investors’ expectations
about future ﬁrm value.

H1b.

3.2 Stakeholder speciﬁcity
Practitioner reputation ratings like the Fortune reputation
rating or the German Manager Magazine reputation rating are
also criticised because they frequently use a limited
respondent pool relying solely on the perceptions of experts.
There exist only rare examples of reputation measurement
approaches surveying other stakeholder groups like,
for
example, customers or the general public (Fombrun et al.,
2000; Fryxell and Wang, 1994; Walsh and Beatty, 2007).

However, different stakeholder groups have different views
on the reputation of a ﬁrm. For instance, customers can be
assumed to be much more able to evaluate the quality of a
company’s products and services than the use of its assets
(Walsh and Beatty, 2007). In the same way, events and
personal experiences with the ﬁrm affect the stakeholder
groups’ perceptions of corporate reputation in different ways.
Thus, a ﬁrm can have “multiple reputations” (Zyglidopoulos,
2001). Each of
these stakeholder groups inﬂuences the
performance of a company differently (Dowling, 2006).

As

far as we know,

there has been no research
simultaneously examining the multiple reputations of a ﬁrm
and their respective levels of value-relevance – i.e. whether
reputation perceptions held by different
dynamics of
stakeholder groups are different
in terms of how they
indicate value-relevance. Though the same set of events has
different

groups
(Zyglidopoulos, 2001), we conclude:

H2. The value-relevance of corporate reputation as
perceived by different stakeholder groups varies
signiﬁcantly – i.e. these “multiple reputations” have
different predictive abilities concerning investors’
expectations about future ﬁrm value.

4. Empirical study

4.1 Model
From a methodological point of view, levels of ﬁrm value and
levels of market-based assets are highly auto-correlated (Mizik
and Jacobson, 2009). Rose and Thomson (2004) provide
empirical evidence to support this assertion using reputation
rankings and levels of market-to-book ratios in a Danish ﬁrm
sample over a fvie-year period. Taking ﬁrst differences of
model variables is a well established method that “solves”
autocorrelations, controls for
latent heterogeneity, and
removes time-invariant, ﬁrm-speciﬁc effects (Greene, 2008;
Maddala, 2001; Mizik and Jacobson, 2009). This robust
approach estimates the parameters of time-varying variables
consistently and is especially recommendable in the two
period panels (Greene, 2008) that we encounter in this study.
Because we do not assume a linear trend in the levels model,

Even if ﬁrst differencing might worsen the measurement
error, this approach is preferable because we are interested in
whether reputation contains value-relevant information (i.e.
whether changes
in that metric contain information
signiﬁcantly associated with ﬁnancial market outcomes)
(Mizik and Jacobson, 2009). Thus, we formulate the
following model:

2008 (before and after the ﬁnancial crisis year of 2008). The
global market research agency TNS Infratest conducted
computer-aided telephone interviews with representative
samples of the German general public. The sample sizes
were 2,423 (2007) and 1,830 (2008). The interviewers asked
respondents to provide reputation ratings for four randomly
selected companies (at least known by name). The applied
selection rule assured that we obtained a minimum of 100
ratings per company. Additionally, TNS Infratest conducted
266 computer-aided personal interviews with representatives
of German opinion leader groups in December 2007 and
2008. Every respondent had to evaluate all companies. The
sample size for each of the opinion leader subgroups (ﬁnancial
analysts,
leaders,
economists, and representatives of NGOs/NPOs) ranged

We measured the indicators on seven-point Likert scales
and aggregated them to factor scores by applying principal
component analysis after we had made sure that all
requirements with regard to the both reﬂective measurement
models (Hair et al., 2006) had been met. To ensure reliability,
we separately computed the Cronbach’s a coefﬁcients for the
two components
for all
stakeholder groups. The coefﬁcients range from 0.753 to
0.956, proving high reliability of the measurement models in
all groups. Furthermore, all factor loadings lie above the
threshold of 0.7, and therefore, all values of average variance
extracted (AVE) are also very satisfactory (see Table II).

(competence and likeability)

Subsequently, we obtained an aggregated competence and
likeability score by taking the average of the general public
and opinion leader scores. To make sure that all stakeholder
group models were comparable in terms of the companies
evaluated, we excluded all companies that had too many
missing values (less than 30 ratings) for more than one
stakeholder group. Hence, we had available 28 complete
company datasets indicating the competence and likeability
perceptions of all stakeholder groups. We obtained the
ﬁnancial market data for these securities from the ﬁnancial
database Datastream.

4.3 Results
Table III shows the descriptive statistics for the model
variables. While the level of market-to-book ratio declined
substantially (2 1.23), there is no such unambiguous pattern
for levels of competence/likeability as noted by the different

4.2 Data
The securities market being examined consists of “blue chip”
stocks that were members of
the Deutsche Aktienindex
(DAX; see www.dax-indices.com/EN) between 31 December
2007 and 31 December 2008. The reputation data used in
this study is based on a measurement model developed by
Schwaiger (2004). This approach has been validated in
different countries (Eberl, 2009; Zhang and Schwaiger,
2009), frequently applied in diverse research studies (Eberl
and Schwaiger, 2005; Sarstedt et al., 2008; Sarstedt and
Schloderer, 2009), and successfully adapted by several
multinational companies as a metric of corporate reputation
management (European Centre for Reputation Studies,
2010). Furthermore, Wilczynski et al. (2009) show that
Schwaiger’s (2004) approach outperforms other approaches
such as the AMAC (Hutton, 1986) or RQ (Fombrun et al.,
2000), inter alia, in terms of criterion validity.

Table I shows the six items used in that reputation metric to
measure the competence and likeability component. The
reputation measurements are culled from two consecutive
survey waves analysed in December 2007 and December

The value-relevance of corporate reputation during the ﬁnancial crisis

Journal of Product & Brand Management

stakeholder group, some companies were able to improve
their reputation, while others showed a decline in their
reputation scores. In particular, in analysing the changes in
the respondents’ perceptions of the companies between 2007
and 2008, we ﬁnd only three companies that do not show any
signiﬁcant changes
likeability and
competence scores across all stakeholder groups. Although
the concept of corporate reputation generally includes a
stable, long-term evaluation of a corporation, this ﬁnding is
an indication that the relative short period of one year is
sufﬁcient for one to observe signiﬁcant changes in corporate
reputation and, thus for one to analyse its impact on changes
in ﬁrm value. Even though the correlations between the
various stakeholder groups’ perceptions of the affective and
cognitive
reputation vary
considerably (ranging from 2 0.25 to 0.89), the correlations
between these variables and the market-to-book ratio are,
with one exception, positive – though the amplitude of these
correlations is quite large (2 0.08 to 0.54). In particular, the
correlations between the market-to-book ratio and the across-
stakeholder-groups aggregated competence as well as
likeability scores are positive and highly signiﬁcant (0.52
each with p , 0:01). Additionally, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant positive
correlations between the market-to-book ratio and likeability
(0.54 with p , 0:01) as well as competence (0.43 with
p , 0:05) as perceived by the general public and competence
as perceived by opinion leaders (0.45 with p , 0:05). We also
observe positive correlations – but correlations that are
weaker
in magnitude – between the two reputation
components in some of the opinion leader subgroups and
the market-to-book ratio. These ﬁndings provide us with
preliminary indications supporting our research hypotheses.

of

Before model estimation, multicollinearity checks gave no
cause for concern. However, the results of Breusch-Pagan-
tests showed that the assumption of homoscedasticity is
violated. Therefore, we used the generalised regression
approach with robust estimation of the variance-covariance
structure, which allowed for a more ﬂexible error structure
and more efﬁcient estimation (Greene, 2008).

Table IV shows the results for all stakeholder group-speciﬁc
models, including the null model, with omitted likeability and
competence covariates. The null model ﬁts the data quite well
(adjusted R2 ¼ 0:370). The coefﬁcient of top-line ﬁnancial
performance (D ln Sales) does not differ signiﬁcantly from
zero, while the coefﬁcients of bottom-line ﬁnancial
performance (DRoA) and the size variable (D ln TotalAssets)
are quite large (0.555 and 2 0.816) and highly signiﬁcant,
with the expected signs. However, in four cases, the ﬁt of this
null model can be considerably improved by augmenting the
model with the corporate reputation components. The
likelihood ratio x2 test shows that a model augmented with
the competence and likeability scores aggregated across all
stakeholder groups signiﬁcantly outperforms the null model
(p , 0:01). The adjusted R2 (0.527) of
is
substantially higher. Consequently, we can conﬁrm our ﬁrst
research hypothesis, especially when considering the results of
the correlation analyses, which revealed positive relationships
between ﬁrm value and the reputation components.
Consequently, we are able to state that corporate reputation
is value-relevant, though its dynamics and association with
ﬁrm value depend on the focused stakeholder group. While
the economist model, the opinion leader model (p , 0:10 in
both cases) and especially the general public model (p , 0:05)

indicate that competence and likeability as noted by these
groups include value-relevant information beyond standard
accounting variables, all the other stakeholder group-speciﬁc
models (those for analysts, journalists, politicians, economic
leaders, and representatives of NGOs/NPOs) cannot
outperform the null model.

However, in all stakeholder group-speciﬁc models, signs of
coefﬁcients of the two reputation components are positive
with two only exceptions. Looking in greater detail at the
components of corporate reputation, we observe that the
coefﬁcient of the affective component in the aggregated model
is clearly larger than zero (0.349 with p , 0:01), while we ﬁnd
the coefﬁcient of the cognitive component to be slightly lower
(0.230) and only signiﬁcant at p , 0:10. Another interesting
ﬁnding is

components varies in particular between the general public
and the opinion leader groups. While the coefﬁcient of the
likeability component is positive and highly signiﬁcant solely
in the general public model (0.438 with p , 0:01),
the
coefﬁcients of the competence component are (more weakly)
positively associated with the market-to-book ratio in the
opinion leader model (0.345 with p , 0:05), the economic
leader model (0.252 with p , 0:10), and the economist model
(0.368 with p , 0:05). Hence, we ﬁnd support for hypotheses
H1a and H1b suggesting that both likeability and competence
are value-relevant. However, these results clearly show that
the stakeholder speciﬁcity is considerable.

Looking at the adjusted R2 and the information criteria, we
ﬁnd that the general public model is the best-ﬁtting model
and outperforms all other stakeholder-group models at least
by trend. To further validate this stakeholder speciﬁcity, we
compared the different non-nested stakeholder group models
using Vuong’s Z-test (Vuong, 1989). We observe that the
general public model outperforms ﬁve out of seven competing
stakeholder group-speciﬁc models, namely those of
the
analysts,
journalists, politicians, economic leaders, and
NGOs/NPOs, but only at a 10 per cent signiﬁcance level.
The general public model does not statistically signiﬁcantly
outperform the opinion leader model or the economist model,
although adjusted R2 values vary considerably between
models: 0.555 (general public) versus 0.424 (opinion
leaders) and 0.423 (economists). Another interesting ﬁnding
is that the aggregated model does not signiﬁcantly outperform
any of
In
summary, we ﬁnd support for hypothesis H2, indicating that
the value-relevance of corporate reputation is stakeholder
group-speciﬁc. This is particularly true with regard to the
value relevance of the cognitive and affective component of
corporate reputation.

Corporate reputation possesses
captures aspects of ﬁnancial market dynamics that cannot
be fully explained by standard accounting metrics.
In
particular, our results show that corporate reputation is
value-relevant during an economic shock. Even though the
corporations were not able to elude the overall negative
impact of the ﬁnancial crisis, the magnitude of this inﬂuence
depended for a single corporation on the individual dynamics
of reputation. Companies that were able to protect their
reputation from damages or were even able to improve their
reputation were rewarded because investors anticipate that

The value-relevance of corporate reputation during the ﬁnancial crisis

reputation management

such companies are less negatively affected by a trans-
like the ﬁnancial crisis. This
national, negative event
exempliﬁes
is
marginalised companies not only put one of
their most
valuable intangible assets (and, consequently, their long-term
performance) at risk (Hall, 1992) but also are directly
“punished” by investors. Even though managers cannot
inﬂuence the course of a trans-national crisis,
they can
immunise their company from its impacts by managing the
ﬁrm’s reputation (Sarstedt, 2009).

Our results extend previous research because we are able to
show that the affective component of corporate reputation is
at least as important as the cognitive component. This calls
into question many measurement approaches focusing on the
cognitive component of corporate reputation and its ﬁnancial
strategy focusing
drivers. A reputation management
additionally on “non-ﬁnancial” drivers
like perceived
corporate social responsibility or a ﬁrm’s attractiveness as an
employer can be much more promising (Schloderer et al.,
2009; Schwaiger, 2004).
In particular, considering the
emotional aspects of reputation might hold great potential
for additional differentiation in competitive industries and
markets.

Another interesting ﬁnding is – as the model with the
aggregated perceptions of the general public and opinion
leaders shows – that perceptions of corporate reputation
revealed by more broadly based groups tend to be more
indicative than the perceptions of more homogeneous groups.
If we assume that there is one “true” but unknown “overall”
corporate reputation composed of the perceptions of the
various stakeholder groups, we might argue that the combined
dynamics of the perceptions of all stakeholders are much
more representative of the multitude of effects of events that
shape “overall” corporate reputation than are the dynamics of
the perceptions of a single stakeholder group (“the wisdom of
the crowd”; Schwaiger et al., 2009). Moreover, investors are
more likely to pay attention to all reputation-relevant events
that can have a differential impact on the perceptions of the
various stakeholder groups, and thus ﬁrm value; they are less
likely to be focused on the dynamics of reputation as
perceived by a small group of stakeholders. This ﬁnding is in
line with the efﬁcient market hypothesis assuming that
investors incorporate all available information about value-
relevant events into their expectations about future ﬁrm value
(Fama, 1970).

Our ﬁndings’ generalisability is limited by the fact that we
have analysed only very large corporations over a limited
period of time. Individuals can be assumed to have signiﬁcant
knowledge about these large ﬁrms and to be consistently
exposed to relevant information by the media. Moreover,
involvement is likely to be higher for these well-known ﬁrms.
However, based on our
results, we would currently
recommend surveying corporate reputation as perceived by
a broad base of stakeholders to measure “overall” corporate
reputation more exactly and capture more accurately the
“full” value-relevance of corporate reputation.

Analysing the results in detail, we observe that the value-
likeability and competence varies across the
relevance of
different stakeholder groups: likeability as perceived by the
general public is signiﬁcantly associated with ﬁrm value,
whereas we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant link between competence as
perceived by opinion leaders and ﬁrm value. Assuming that
many opinion leaders have considerably more knowledge

their

rather

about ﬁrms, their perceptions regarding reputation are likely
to be much more strongly affected by drivers of the cognitive
like past ﬁnancial performance, management
component,
expertise, or
the management’s vision and leadership
(Schwaiger, 2004). The general public might be less
informed about company facts;
reputation
perceptions may be much more strongly fed by emotional
appeals or social and environmental responsibility. These
drivers of reputation are signiﬁcantly associated with the
affective component of reputation (Schwaiger, 2004). In this
capacity, our results seem to be plausible. However, we would
expect NGO and NPO representatives to pay much more
attention to the affective component of
reputation.
Nevertheless, our model is not able to test this hypothesis;
rather, our model tests how investors weight the perceptions
of different stakeholder groups. Consequently, our results
imply that, for instance, likeability as perceived by the general
public is signiﬁcantly linked to immediate investor behaviour,
while likeability as perceived by NGOs/NPOs is not. This
does not mean that the perceptions of NGOs/NPOs do not
affect ﬁrm value at all but rather indicates that associated
effects might be much more long-term by nature. Such long-
term effects could be revealed, for example, by portfolio
studies (Srinivasan and Hanssens, 2009), so this opens an
avenue for further research.

In summary, it might be useful to weight the perceptions of
individuals differently depending on the stakeholder group
with which they are afﬁliated. Considering this could greatly
improve the predictive power of the models and help ﬁrms to
better anticipate and manage the reputation-relevant effects of
events it
the allocation of communications
resources to different stakeholder groups) and those triggered
by a third party (e.g.
the corporate misbehaviour of a
competitor, which could also affect the reputation of the focal
ﬁrm).

Executive summary and implications for
managers and executives

This summary has been provided to allow managers and executives
a rapid appreciation of the content of the article. Those with a
particular interest in the topic covered may then read the article in
toto to take advantage of the more comprehensive description of the
research undertaken and its results to get the full beneﬁt of the
material present.

The reputation of any company is perceived as an intangible
asset that plays a crucial part in performance and sustained
achievement. Researchers propose that corporate reputation
is the outcome of
the “overall evaluation by various
stakeholders” whose “attitudes, decisions and behaviours”
are inﬂuenced as a result. The potential beneﬁts to a ﬁrm able
to boast a positive reputation are numerous and include:
. A belief that the company’s products or services are of

superior quality and more reliable.

399

. Customers perceive fewer risks and greater trust with their
purchase decisions, and buying intention increases as
a result. This in turn stimulates greater customer
satisfaction and loyalty.
Scope to charge premium prices for products and services.
. Positive impact on the recruitment of talented employees
who will subsequently be less susceptible to competitor
attempts to entice them away.

.

. Lower costs within the supplier market.
. Higher creditworthiness and easier access to capital.

That reputation is almost impossible to imitate enhances its
value as a differentiator even further. Its fragility should not
be ignored though. While a good reputation will only emerge
over a long period of time, destruction of the asset can occur
almost instantly.

Many analysts have also noted the strong link between good
reputation and superior ﬁnancial performance, reﬂected in
such as higher earnings and returns on assets. The resulting
increase in attractiveness to investors allows the ﬁrm to issue
stocks at a higher price. In addition, investment in companies
with a positive reputation is based on anticipation that the
ﬁnancial value of the organisation will increase even more in
the future. The reverse is also true, and investors will avoid
companies whose reputation has been tarnished by such as
inferior product quality on the assumption that business
volume will fall and the ﬁnancial performance will suffer
accordingly.

Evidence shows that various deﬁnitions of corporate
reputation prevail. Given that
represents an external
perspective, scholars differentiate the concept from identity
and image. They point out that identity relates to how the
organisation perceives itself from within, whereas image is
taken to reﬂect how the company desires to be viewed by its
stakeholders.

it

Methods used to measure corporate reputation are also
subject to some debate. In particular, accusations abound that
the approaches are disproportionately weighted towards
ﬁnancial competence of the company to the expense of
other valuable indicators. Although the importance of
perceived expertise is acknowledged, total reliance on such
cognitive aspects may produce an incomplete picture.
Analysts claim that people also trust things such as gut
feelings about a company and consequently believe that
attitude towards an organisation has an affective dimension as
well as a cognitive one. It is therefore believed that corporate
communication and behaviour, along with individual
experiences of the ﬁrm, construct reputation through their
respective impact on people’s knowledge and emotions.

Several researchers have argued that a similarly narrow
approach pervades the choice of respondents to evaluate
corporate reputation. The charge here is that most exclusively
seek expert opinion and fail to survey other stakeholder
groups such as customers or
the wider public. Each
stakeholder group will relate differently to the ﬁrm, and that
uniqueness of experience will shape their perceptions of it.
For instance, it is suggested that customers will feel much
more equipped to evaluate a company’s product quality than
how it deploys its assets. Each stakeholder group can
effectively ascribe its own reputation to a company and
simultaneously develop its own expectation about the current
and future value of the ﬁrm.


The value-relevance of corporate reputation during the ﬁnancial crisis

Research and ﬁndings
In the current study, Raithel et al. focus on these issues and
also examine the possibility that a sound reputation may
protect companies against
the full effects of a serious
economic downturn, such as the one that commenced
during 2008. The authors examine the performance of
various blue chip stocks on the German stock market between
31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008. The established
approach used incorporated six items to measure the
competence and likeability reputation components based on
data obtained from surveys conducted at the beginning and
end of this period. Surveys consisted of computer-aided
telephone interviews with the German public and computer-
aided personal interviews with members of German opinion
leader groups, which included ﬁnancial analysts, politicians,
economists, NGOs
others.
Competence and likeability ratings obtained from the
general
samples were
subsequently aggregated to produce complete datasets for
28 ﬁrms.

and

The ﬁndings revealed that:

. Apart from three companies, the reputation improved for
some companies and declined for others. The authors
conclude that one year may be sufﬁcient to measure
changes in corporate reputation, even though the concept
is generally seen as a longer-term phenomenon.

. The inﬂuence of corporate reputation on investor

expectation about ﬁrm value is considerable.

. Both the cognitive and affective components of corporate
reputation are positively correlated with investor
anticipation about the future value of the company.

However, it is important to note that the degree of predicted
impact of corporate reputation on future ﬁrm value appears
subject to variation between different stakeholder groups. The
likelihood that the general public would be less knowledgeable
about issues like ﬁnancial performance and expertise is one
reason why Raithel et al. had expected such a ﬁnding. This
variation of
the reputation components was particularly

evident when comparing the general public and opinion
leader groups. In line with the belief of certain scholars, the
likeability component was positively associated with the
general public and the competence component with different
opinion leader groups. The connection was markedly stronger
in the general public sample though.

Conclusions
This study provided evidence that ﬁrms able to maintain or
even improve their corporate reputation are viewed by
investors as a more attractive proposition than other
organisations during global crises like a major economic
downturn. Companies are therefore reminded about
the
importance of managing their reputation in order to protect a
priceless asset that is vital to remaining successful. The results
also reveal a need to consider both corporate reputation
components in the knowledge that a focus limited to ﬁnancial
drivers of reputation may prove inadequate. Management
should therefore attend to emotional aspects of reputation
that might include corporate social responsibility and how the
ﬁrm appeals as an employer. The authors also believe that the
combined perceptions of all stakeholders provide a more
accurate depiction of corporate reputation and advocate an
approach that considers all such perceptions and events rather
than those pertaining to a limited number of stakeholder

value and consequences of this approach could be investigated
