ABSTRACT. This article examines whether the likeli-
hood and amount of firm charitable giving in response to
catastrophic events are related to firm advertising inten-
sity, and whether industry competition level moderates
this relationship. Using data on Chinese firms’ philan-
thropic response to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, we find
that firm advertising intensity is positively associated with
both the probability and the amount of corporate giving.
The results also indicate that this positive advertising
intensity-philanthropic giving relationship is stronger in
competitive industries, and firms in competitive industries
are more likely to donate. This study thus provides evi-
dence suggesting that even in the wake of catastrophic
events, corporate philanthropic giving is strategic.

Introduction

Recent catastrophic events, such as the 9/11 New
York terrorist attacks in 2001, the South Asian tsu-
nami in December 2004, Hurricane Katrina in the
southern U.S. in August 2005, the Kashmiri earth-
quake in October 2005, and China’s Sichuan
earthquake in May 2008 were all devastating and
spurred philanthropic actions by individuals, cor-
porations, nongovernmental organizations,
and
government agencies. In particular, many companies
responded by giving donations (e.g., cash, goods,
and employee voluntary efforts) as part of
their
corporate social responsibility (CSR). Carroll (1979)
argues that CSR has four intimately related facets –
economic,
and philanthropic –
with organizations striving to achieve all the four

ethical,

legal,

simultaneously. On the bases of these components, a
socially responsible ﬁrm ‘‘should strive to make a
proﬁt, obey the law, be ethical, and be a good
corporate citizen’’ (Carroll, 1991, p. 43).

This research focuses on one special class of CSR –
corporate philanthropic giving (CPG). Although
corporate philanthropic response is not enforced as
are economic and legal responsibilities, it is increas-
ingly practiced by companies and is generally viewed
as a sign of good corporate citizenship. Previous
research (e.g., Chapple and Moon, 2005; Katz et al.,
2001; Kolk, 2005; Muller and Whiteman, 2009;
Shen, 2004; Welford, 2005) suggests that companies
worldwide react and respond differently to natural
disasters, and their philanthropic donations can be
motivated by a variety of factors, including cultural,
institutional (e.g., stakeholder conﬁgurations), orga-
nizational, economic, and geographic. The motiva-
tion for corporate giving is not inherently altruistic.
Corporate giving is a reaction to seismic shifts in the
environmental landscape, and it represents a reactive
strategy crafted to counter pressures such as stake-
holder demands, threats of government intrusion into
industry’s freedom, and escalating public expectations
(Campbell et al., 1999; Gardberg and Fombrun, 2006;
Patten, 2008).

In today’s global business, CPG is becoming more
strategic, as has been indicated by Brammer and
Millington (2006), Saiia (2002), and Sa´nchez (2000).
Ever-increasing global competition requires
that
ﬁrms establish their competitive advantage from
various sources. Corporate philanthropy may help a
ﬁrm establish reputation, brand recognition, and
loyalty; promote itself as a ‘‘socially responsible’’ ﬁrm,
or attract and maintain a work force (Sa´nchez, 2000).

the company forge a relationship with the customer
and build loyalty. From a marketing perspective, it is
also common for companies to invest in advertising to
achieve the common goals of building stronger rela-
tionships with customers and enhancing customer
loyalty (Dick and Basu, 1994). For example, adver-
tising inﬂuences the attitude–behavior relationship
through its
impact on accessibility (Berger and
Mitchell, 1989). The underlying mechanism may be
explained as follows: repeated advertising exposure
can potentially enhance consumers’ conﬁdence by
allowing them to process more information, repeat-
ing attitudinal decisions, and providing more oppor-
tunities
for brand-relevant cognitive elaboration
(Berger and Mitchell, 1989; Oliver, 1999). As in most
cases both corporate philanthropy and advertising
serve the common purpose of building customer
loyalty, we predict that ﬁrms with large advertising
expenses will tend to have higher likelihood of giving
and to donate larger amounts.

The relationships between advertising expenses
and philanthropy in different
industries are not
actually the same. Amato and Amato (2007) ﬁnd that
industry effects explain between 20 and 22% of the
total variation in donation ratios of the ﬁrms. Peer
pressure may create an environment that requires
ﬁrms to meet or exceed competitor philanthropy to
maintain customer and community goodwill. In this
study, we investigated whether charitable donation
amounts and the likelihood of ﬁrm response to
catastrophic events relate to ﬁrm advertising inten-
sity, and how this relationship varies with industry
competition levels, a topic that has not been previ-
ously discussed in the CPG literature.1

The context of our study is the Sichuan earthquake
in China, which took place in May 2008. Anecdotal
evidence indicates that Chinese companies quickly
and effectively responded to the call for donations and
disaster response efforts, and that corporate donations
were signiﬁcant. We identiﬁed 703 Chinese listed
ﬁrms that engaged in CPG through outright cash
donations and/or in-kind donations with the value
released by the donor ﬁrm in May and June 2008. We
ﬁnd that the likelihood and extent of corporate
contributions are positively related to ﬁrms’ adver-
tising intensity. We also document the moderating
effect of industry competition level on the relation-
ship: the positive relationship between CPG and
advertising intensity is signiﬁcantly strengthened in

more competitive industries. Our ﬁndings are robust
when we use a different measure of competition levels
or examine only ﬁrms that made donations. Besides
that, the decision to engage in CPG and the amount
of donations are positively associated with ﬁrm size,
proﬁtability, and cash available. Geographic location
(in the earthquake province) is positively related to
ﬁrm total donation amount. The decision to engage
in CPG is negatively correlated with ﬁrm leverage.
Results suggest that CPG decisions and the extent of
donations are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by industry
type, substantially motivated by strategic consider-
ation, and greatly constrained by economic factors in
emerging markets such as China.

This study contributes to the literature in several
ways. First, using a unique research setting provided
by the Sichuan earthquake, we investigate the link
between CPG and advertising intensity. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst empirical study
explicitly addressing such an association. Second, we
provide evidence of positive association between
advertising intensity and CPG. We also ﬁnd a medi-
ating effect of industry competition on this relation-
ship. These ﬁndings are consistent with previous
research in that CSR activities are driven by strategic
motivation and constrained by economic consider-
ations. Our results add to our understanding of the
motivations behind CPG and carry important
implications for practice. Third, we contribute to the
literature on sustainability, performance, and CSR by
investigating the association between corporate
philanthropy (donations) and ﬁrm characteristics.
Finally, while the issue of CPG has attracted growing
research interest in recent years, most empirical results
are based on U.S. data, and this article is one of the few
empirical studies in emerging markets using a large
research sample. This article adds
to a growing
number of non-U.S. studies by investigating the link
between ﬁrm advertising and CPG in China, the
largest developing economy in the world.

Background and hypotheses development

Background

The 2008 Sichuan earthquake, which registered 8.0
on the Richter scale, occurred on the afternoon of
May 12, 2008.2 As of September 11, 2008, ofﬁcial
ﬁgures stated that 69,226 people were conﬁrmed
dead and 374,643 injured; 17,923 were still listed as
missing (Xinhua Net, 2008a). Approximately 45.5
million people lived in the affected area (Xinhua
Net, 2008b). The earthquake left about 4.8 million
people homeless, though the number could be as
high as 11 million (Hooker, 2008). It was both the
strongest and the deadliest earthquake to hit China
the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which
since
claimed the lives of at
least 240,000 (Spignesi,
2005). The direct economic loss is estimated as
high as 123 billion U.S. dollars (Shanghai Daily,
2008).

Research indicates

such as hurricanes will

that climate-related natural
disasters
likely increase
(Emanuel, 2005; Webster et al., 2005), and the
aggregate social and economic costs of such events
have been rising steadily since the 1960s (Muller and
Whiteman, 2009). This
increasing propensity to
natural disasters calls for more ﬁnancial and social
disaster relief efforts by the government, individuals,
and corporations
in the future. As Muller and
Whiteman (2009) suggest, such corporate activities
include donations in cash and in kind, as well as
employee volunteer jobs. In recent years, with the
economic development of emerging markets, listed
ﬁrms in those markets have been more and more
involved in corporate social activities. After the 5/12
Sichuan earthquake, almost half of the ﬁrms listed on
the Chinese stock market made relief efforts.3
According to the Deputy Secretary-General of the
China Charity Foundation (CCF), both the number
of companies participating and the size of the gifts
were extraordinary (Wang, 2008).

Seifert et al. (2003) provide comprehensive outlines
of empirical research studies, critiques, and reviews
that have examined motivations for CPG. Speaking
in general,
four possible
motivations for CPG: strategic, political, altruistic,
and managerial utility.

Strategic motivations
Saiia et al. (2003, p. 170) deﬁne strategic philan-
thropy as
‘‘giving of corporate
resources to address non-business community issues
that also beneﬁt the ﬁrm’s strategic position and,
ultimately, its bottom line.’’ According to this deﬁ-
nition, ﬁrms ‘‘do good in order to do well,’’ and
corporate philanthropy appears to be consistent with
the concept of the proﬁt-maximizing model of a
business. Hess et al. (2002), Smith and Stodghill
(1994), and Vidaver-Cohen and Altman (2000)
argue that ﬁrm philanthropic

activities

Political motivations
As Sa´nchez (2000) states, the political perspective is
also strategically motivated. This view posits that
ﬁrms engage in philanthropy to maximize beneﬁts,
but not in the form of an economic return on
investment (ROI). Rather, philanthropy is used to
maximize a ﬁrm’s political ROI. Corporate philan-
thropy builds image and furthers corporate political
interests ‘‘for the purpose of securing rewards and
reducing penalties from signiﬁcant external publics’’
(Neiheisel, 1994, p. 42). Community recognition
for CSR is important to corporations with local
community roots, particularly for non-state-owned
corporations to build political ties.

Motivations for CPG

The motivations for CPG have been documented
extensively in the literature (Brammer and Milling-
ton, 2005, 2006; Campbell et al., 2002; Saiia et al.,
2003; Seifert et al., 2003). Campbell et al. (2002) and

Altruistic motivations
Some scholars view corporate philanthropy as a
practice of good citizenship, an obligation to maxi-
mize public welfare, and giving with nothing
expected in return; thus, they interpret corporate
philanthropy as altruism (Campbell et al., 1999;
Cowton, 1987; Shaw and Post, 1993).


42

Ran Zhang et al.

Managerial utility motivations
This view uses agency theory (deeply rooted in
economic literature and developed in ﬁnance liter-
ature) to explain motivations for CPG. From an
agency theory perspective, scholars argue that cor-
porate philanthropy is likely to enhance the CEO’s
self-interests, but unlikely to maximize shareholder
wealth (e.g., Atkinson and Galaskiewicz, 1988).
Corporate philanthropy is viewed as an attempt by
executives to enhance their social standing in the
community, self-image, or personal prestige at the
expense of the company (Galaskiewicz, 1997; Haley,
1991).

(2000).

and Sa´nchez

One notable trend of CPG is

that corporate
charity giving is becoming more strategic, as indi-
cated by Brammer and Millington (2006), Saiia
(2002),
In recent years,
increased global competition has required that ﬁrms
establish their competitive advantage from various
sources. Corporate philanthropy may help a ﬁrm
establish brand recognition and loyalty, promote it-
self as a ‘‘socially responsible’’ ﬁrm, or attract and
maintain a work force (Sa´nchez, 2000). As Brammer
and Millington (2006) suggest, strategy plays a sig-
niﬁcant role in determining how ﬁrms manage their
philanthropy. Our study thus focuses on the strategic
motives for giving and its relationship with ﬁrm
advertising intensity, while taking into account
industry competition level.

CPG and ﬁrm characteristics

Numerous studies have documented ﬁrm charac-
teristics that affect donation decisions, i.e., whether
or not to donate, and the amount of donations
(Brammer and Millington, 2004, 2005; Campbell
and Slack, 2006; Coffey and Wang, 1998; Wang
and Coffey, 1992). Speaking in general, ﬁrm size,
proﬁtability, cash resources available, geography,
leverage, and industry have been found to be
correlated with ﬁrm CPG decision and amount.

Firm size, reﬂecting and embodying a diverse
range of ﬁrm attributes, has been documented to be
positively correlated to CPG decision and donation
amount (Amato and Amato, 2007; Brammer and
Millington, 2006; Muller and Whiteman, 2009).
Economic causes for this correlation might include
large ﬁrms’ greater absolute levels of resources,

possible economies of
scale in CSR activities,
and the fact that larger ﬁrms are likely to be more
mature and, therefore, are unlikely to face a signif-
icant number of attractive alternative investments
(Orlitzky, 2001).

Proﬁtability and cash resources available have also
been found to be positively related to CPG (Adams
and Hardwick, 1998; Crampton and Patten, 2008;
Galaskiewicz, 1997; Useem, 1988). Useem (1988,
p.78) argues that ‘‘the single most important market
factor underlying corporate giving is the traditional
measure of company success,
income.’’
Crampton and Patten (2008) ﬁnd that differences
in the extent of corporate giving following the
9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 were positively and
signiﬁcantly associated with differences
in ﬁrm
proﬁtability. The other measure of ﬁrm resources is
cash available. Seifert et al. (2003) show a positive
relationship between a ﬁrm’s available cash resources
and cash donations.

its net

Geography could be another factor that affects
ﬁrms’ CPG decisions and variations in donation
amounts. Muller and Whiteman (2009) ﬁnd a ‘‘home
region effect’’ and a ‘‘local presence effect’’ in CPG:
ﬁrms are more attentive to disasters that are closer to
home or in areas where they have a local presence.

Previous studies have found that leverage is neg-
atively related to CPG, as ﬁrm donation is restricted
by resources available and ﬁrms with more debt have
more pressure to pay off their debt, which reduces
available resources. Adams and Hardwick (1998)
ﬁnd that the decision to contribute is negatively
related to leverage, and Brammer and Millington
(2005) show that among givers, the rate of giving is
related negatively to ﬁrm indebtedness.

CPG, advertising intensity, and industry competition
level: hypothesis development

According to Nelson’s (1970, 1974) view, advertis-
ing provides consumers with information to distin-
guish among different kinds of products. In order to
successfully differentiate from their counterparts,
ﬁrms may invest more in advertising. McWilliams
and Siegel (2001) suggest that companies can also
adopt CSR as a differentiation strategy because CSR
helps a ﬁrm to build its reputation as being reliable
and honest. Indeed, studies show that consumers


Corporate Philanthropic Giving and Advertising

43

assume the products of a reliable and honest ﬁrm will
be of high quality (Brammer and Millington, 2005;
Fisman et al., 2006). A survey of 463 U.S. companies
found that companies taking a more businesslike
approach to charity reported a better image, increased
employee loyalty, and improved customer
ties
(Schwartz and Smart, 1995). Another survey by
Walker Information Inc., a research and consulting
company that tracks customer satisfaction and busi-
ness ethics, found that 47 percent of consumers would
be more likely to buy from a ‘‘good’’ company that
was socially responsible (Sato, 1998).

Prior literature has documented the relationship
between advertising and provision of CSR. Navarro
(1988) concludes that ﬁrms that spend more on
advertising tend to give more to charity. McWil-
liams and Siegel (2000) ﬁnd that advertising is an
element of a differentiation strategy, and it is posi-
tively correlated with corporate social performance.
Fisman et al. (2006) ﬁnd that CSR is more prevalent
in advertising-intensive (consumer-oriented) indus-
tries. Brown et al. (2006) support the theory that
charitable giving enhances shareholder value, and
within an industry, advertising intensity is positively
related to companies’ giving.

As a special class of CSR, CPG is also similar to
other classes of CSR. For example, Crampton and
Patten (2008) ﬁnd that CPG is constrained by similar
economic concerns. We posit that ﬁrms view CPG
strategically, and ﬁrms with more market investments
are more likely to give and give more in response to
the Sichuan earthquake. Accordingly, we hypothesize
that

H1: There is a positive relation between CPG

and the extent of advertising intensity.

Previous research also indicates that industry com-
petition inﬂuences CSR. For example, Fernandez-
Kranz and Santalo (2004) provide evidence that
product market competition is positively associated
with widely used CSR measures. Their estimates
suggest that if all else were constant, doubling the level
of competition in the marketplace would increase the
CSR ratings of an average company by almost 2–8
times. Fisman et al. (2006) ﬁnd that CSR expendi-
tures are more positively correlated with proﬁts in
more competitive industries, owing to the greater
signal value of such expenditures in competitive

environments. Neville et al. (2005) show that the
positive relationship between corporate reputation
and a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance strengthens as
competitive intensity increases. Thus, a ﬁrm in a
highly competitive industry should have more
incentives to use CSR to differentiate itself from its
competitors. Accordingly, we propose the following
hypothesis:

Sample and descriptive analysis

In order to explore the potential relationship between
CPG and advertising intensity, and the moderating
effects of industry competition level, we collected
data on donation amounts and donation characteris-
tics for all companies listed on the Chinese stock
market. In accordance with previous research (e.g.,
Muller and Whiteman, 2009), our investigation is
based on ﬁrm self-reporting and draws from infor-
mation disseminated through the ofﬁcial information
disclosure website appointed by the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC), corporate web-
sites and press releases, and information located by
search queries via Lexis Nexis China and Google
China News.4 We conducted our search in the period
of May–June 2008, as the requirement for a dated
press release increases the likelihood that the con-
tributing ﬁrm is seeking strategic value for its giving
(Patten, 2008).

In total, we identiﬁed 703 companies, about 47%
of the total number of ﬁrms listed in the Chinese
stock market, with an earthquake relief-oriented
press release issued within the time frame of interest.
We measured corporate contributions as (1) outright
cash donations and/or (2) in-kind donations with
the value released by the donation ﬁrm. The an-
nounced contributions for the 703 ﬁrms ranged from
8,000 Yuan to 60,210,000 Yuan with a mean
(median) of 3,086,688 (1,001,000) Yuan. Similar to
Tian and Estrin (2008), we obtained our ﬁrm
ﬁnancial data from the Peking University CCER
Sinoﬁn database. Eighteen ﬁrms had missing ﬁnancial
data, which reduced our giver sample size to 685

ﬁrms. Those ﬁrms are distributed in almost all kinds of
industries, and are mixed B2C (Business to Cus-
tomer), B2B (Business to Business), and B2G (Busi-
ness to Government). According to Tian and Estrin
(2008) Table II, only 5.1% of ﬁrms listed in China are
owned by foreign investors; the rest are Chinese
ﬁrms, owned by family, other domestic industry,
ﬁnancial companies, or the Chinese government.

in the low competition group, and ﬁrms in industries
with HHI < 0.1 (or HHID = 1) are deemed to be
in highly competitive industries. We use t-tests to

examine the differences across the two subsamples.5
The mean of the advertising expense for the low
HHI subsample (0.037), or ﬁrms in more competi-
tive industries, is signiﬁcantly higher than that for the
high HHI subsample (0.030), or ﬁrms in less com-
petitive industries (p < .05). This shows that ﬁrms in
more competitive industries spend more on adver-
tising than ﬁrms in less competitive industries. The
average HHI for the HHID = 1 group of ﬁrms is
0.030, versus 0.249 for the HHID = 0 group of
ﬁrms. Firms in more and less competitive industries
do not differ in size. In less competitive industries,
ﬁrms enjoy higher ROA (return on assets) and more
cash available, which is consistent with the eco-
nomic theory that ﬁrms
in more competitive
industries are less proﬁtable. Almost 5.8% of ﬁrms in
our sample are located in Sichuan province, and the
composition in terms of Sichuan ﬁrms and non-
Sichuan ﬁrms does not differ for high and low HHI
groups. The average leverage ratio, deﬁned as total
debt divided by total assets at the beginning of the
year, is 0.559, and ﬁrms in less competitive industries
seem to have relatively more debt than ﬁrms in more
competitive industries. The signiﬁcant differences in
advertising expense, ROA, cash resources available,
and leverage emphasize the importance of control-
ling for these variables when modeling the rela-
tionship between ﬁrm advertising intensity, industry
competition level, and CPG.6

model. The variable donation, which includes both
cash and in-kind donations, is positively related with
ﬁrm size, ROA, and cash available. This is consistent
with the literature and our conjecture that larger, more
proﬁtable ﬁrms and ﬁrms with more cash resources
available donate more than other ﬁrms. The donation
dummy is positively related to ﬁrm advertising
intensity, size, ROA, and cash available, and nega-
tively related to HHI and leverage. On the one hand,
this is consistent with our main expectation that ﬁrms
spend more on advertising and ﬁrms in competitive
industries are more likely to donate. On the other
hand, this also indicates that larger, more proﬁtable
ﬁrms, as well as ﬁrms with more cash resources, are
more likely to be involved in CPG activities, and ﬁrms
with more debt are less likely to donate after the cat-
astrophic event. Firm advertising intensity is negatively
related to HHI, which is consistent with our previous
ﬁnding that ﬁrms in more competitive industries spend
more on advertising. HHI is positively related to ROA
and cash available, which indicates that ﬁrms in less
competitive industries are more proﬁtable.

other factors also have important effects on the
decision about CPG, such as ﬁrm size (Adams and
Hardwick, 1998; Waddock and Graves, 1997),

order to formally investigate our research questions,
we employ the logistic regression model in equation

Table III shows the results of the logistic regression
models. We use two industry competition variables,
the original HHI and HHID, the HHI dummy
variable, to capture the effect of industry competi-
tion level on ﬁrm CPG behavior. The Cox & Snell
and Nagelkerke pseudo R2 values, developed to
approximate OLS-type R-square functions, show
that both models capture a good proportion of the
variance in the data. In both regressions, the coef-
ﬁcients of advertising intensity are signiﬁcantly
positive (p < .01). These results are consistent with
our expectations that ﬁrms with higher advertising
expenses are more likely to donate in response to the
Sichuan earthquake. The coefﬁcient of HHI is
negative and signiﬁcant, which indicates that ﬁrms in
more competitive industries are more likely to
donate.

Firm size is positively related to ﬁrm donation
dummies, showing that large ﬁrms are more likely to
donate after catastrophic events. This is consistent
with Brammer and Millington’s assertion that large
ﬁrms are more visible to the public and they may
have greater incentives to donate to increase ﬁrm
reputation. Firm cash resources available are also
positively related to ﬁrm donation decisions, in line
with the ﬁnding in the literature that ﬁrms with

higher cash resources are more likely to be involved
in CPG activities
(Crampton and Patten, 2008;
Seifert et al., 2003). The coefﬁcient of ROA is
positive but not signiﬁcant; this is not consistent
with our expectation that more proﬁtable ﬁrms are
more likely to donate (Useem, 1988). Leverage is
found to be negatively correlated to ﬁrm CPG
decisions, and this demonstrates, once again, what
Adams and Hardwick (1998) found, that the deci-
sion to contribute is negatively related to leverage, as
heavily indebted ﬁrms may face more pressure to pay
off debts and thus may have fewer resources to
donate.

Advertising intensity, industry competition level,
and donation amount

While equation (1) tests the likelihood of ﬁrms
donating, in this section, we are interested in seeing
whether the same independent variables inﬂuence
the donation amount. Speciﬁcally, we examine the
relationships of ﬁrm advertising intensity, industry
competition level, and CPG amount
in a more
comprehensive view by considering other factors
that may affect ﬁrm donation amount. Our regres-
sion model is illustrated in equation (2).

including both cash and in-kind donations. As noted
in the table, both models are highly signiﬁcant (based
on the model F-statistics) with adjusted R2s of 0.223
and 0.224. The coefﬁcient on Advert in Reg1 is
positive and signiﬁcant, which indicates that the
advertising intensity is positively associated with
donation amount in response to the Sichuan earth-
quake. The result conﬁrms our hypothesis 1. The
interaction ‘‘Advert  HHI’’ is negatively associated
with differences in the extent of charitable giving in
response to the Sichuan earthquake (p < .05). This
result is consistent with our expectation that the

In accordance with previous ﬁndings

in the
literature, ﬁrm size is positively correlated with the
total amount of giving. Firm proﬁtability and cash
resources available are positively related to ﬁrm
donation amount, suggesting that even in times of
heightened social pressure following catastrophic
events, corporate philanthropy is constrained by
economic concerns (Crampton and Patten, 2008).

located in other provinces after other factors that
affect donation amount are controlled. Leverage is
not signiﬁcant in either of the two models, even
though previous studies show that the extent of
giving is negatively associated with ﬁrm leverage
(Brammer and Millington, 2005).

Further analysis – givers only

Crampton and Patten (2008) suggest that including
zero-Yuan givers may cause potential bias. In order
to verify the robustness of our results, we repeated
our regression analyses of equation (2) using sample
ﬁrms with actual philanthropic giving in response to
the Sichuan earthquake, following Crampton and
Patten’s (2008) procedure. Thus, we separate the
choice of how much to donate from the choice of
whether to make a contribution.

giving are positively associated with ﬁrms’ advertis-
ing intensity. The ﬁndings are consistent with the
strategic view of CPG, in that managers use phil-
anthropic giving as part of the ﬁrm’s strategy. Firms
are not purely altruistic when making philanthropic
donations. Instead ﬁrms utilize CPG as a marketing
strategy to differentiate themselves from their com-
petitors with the intent to establish ﬁrm reputation
and create economic value for shareholders. As a
result, ﬁrms with higher advertising intensity are
more likely to donate and donate more. More
interestingly, we ﬁnd that the positive relationship
between CPG and advertising intensity is stronger in
competitive industries. This
that ﬁrms
in more competitive industries work harder at
differentiating themselves from their competitors.

suggests

This study also ﬁnds that ﬁrm size, proﬁtability,
geography, cash resources, and leverage are signiﬁ-
cantly associated with the CPG decision. These

results are consistent with major ﬁndings in the lit-
erature related to other natural disasters such as the
South Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, and the
Kashmiri earthquake (Crampton and Patten, 2008;
Muller and Whiteman, 2009).

Our ﬁndings offer useful implications for future
research. Although the strategy literature (e.g., Fry
et al., 1982) suggests that advertising and charitable
contributions are complementary inputs in devel-
oping the ﬁrm’s reputation, this perspective has not
been tested previously in an emerging country. As
there are important differences in cultural, institu-
tional,
legal, economic, and ethical backgrounds
between developed and developing countries (Ge
and Thomas, 2007; Lam and Shi, 2008; Whitcomb
et al., 1998), our ﬁnding that ﬁrms in an emerging
market use CPG as a marketing strategy is an
important contribution to the CPG literature.
Moreover, our ﬁnding that industry characteristics

signiﬁcantly affect the relationship between CPG
and advertising intensity suggests that CPG cannot
be viewed in isolation from other corporate behavior
or the economic environment. It is appropriate in
future research to consider CPG as part of both the
economic and the cultural environments.

Our study also has implications for managers and
governors. In view of rising natural catastrophes in
recent years, corporate philanthropic disaster response
is playing a growing role in helping societies recover
from the disasters. Although governments and other
non-proﬁt organizations are major relief sources,
corporate giving plays a major complementary role.
Our results indicate that ﬁrms may not be purely
altruistic when making donations, which is under-
standable because corporations have the objective to
make proﬁts for shareholders. Therefore, the gov-
ernment and its regulatory bodies should consider
designing mechanisms that motivate ﬁrms to make


50

Ran Zhang et al.

more donations and create a win–win situation for all
related parties.

Although this study sheds new light on CPG, it
has several limitations that may be addressed in fu-
ture research. First, our research focuses only on the
CPG behavior of listed ﬁrms in China. While China
is an important emerging market, which provides a
worthwhile research environment, our results may
not generalize to other countries because institu-
tional structure and national culture can affect ﬁrms’
CSR behavior (Furrer et al., 2004). Future research
could compare the strategic use of CPG in different
markets to better understand the roles of institutional
structure and national culture. Second, data avail-
ability limited our sample to listed ﬁrms, while
nonlisted ﬁrms may also donate. Examining the
CPG behavior of nonlisted ﬁrms is promising, as
listed ﬁrms’ donation decisions may be affected by
investor sentiment
in the stock market. Finally,
although we show robust evidence that ﬁrms stra-
tegically use CPG, we did not investigate the deci-
sion process and the determinants of the strategic
decision. It would be a fruitful area to investigate
how ﬁrms plan their CPG strategies and their
antecedent factors.

Notes

1 Although several articles have discussed the relation-
ship between advertising and provision of CSR (Brown
et al., 2006; Fisman et al., 2006; McWilliams and Sie-
gel, 2000; Navarro, 1988), none of those articles docu-
ment whether charitable donation amounts and the
likelihood of ﬁrm response to catastrophic events relate
to ﬁrm advertising intensity, and how this relationship
varies with industry competition levels.

6 Our advertising expense data are from the Sinoﬁn
database. In China, ﬁrms report selling expense in their
income statements and Sinoﬁn provides ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial
data for Chinese listed ﬁrms as Compustat does in the
U.S. Selling expense mainly includes advertising expen-
ditures, salesperson salaries, and commissions. All these
fees are related to activities aimed at promoting sales of
merchandise. For example, if a ﬁrm uses a TV adver-
tisement to promote its products, then the fee will be
recognized as advertising expenditures. If a ﬁrm uses
doorstep selling to promote its products, then the fee
will be recognized as sales salaries. Thus, selling expense
is an appropriate measure of ﬁrms’ advertising intensity.
