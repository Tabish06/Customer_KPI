Abstract

In the present competitive environment, corporate reputation and corporate image are acknowledged as having the potential to
impact on customer loyalty toward the "rm. However, the literature reveals that the precise nature of the relationships that exist
between reputation and image and the understanding of their e!ect on customer behaviour remains a key challenge for both academia
and management alike. With data collected in three service industries, namely 222 consumers in the retail sector, 171 clients of a major
long-distance company and 395 students of a faculty of business administration, this study contributes to the body of knowledge by
empirically testing the nature of the relationship between corporate reputation and corporate image and their e!ect on the customers'
retention decisions. The results of the study reveal that the degree of customer loyalty has a tendency to be higher when perceptions of
both corporate reputation and corporate image are strongly favourable. Moreover, the addition of the interaction between both
constructs contributes to better explain customer loyalty. The implications of the study are discussed from both the research and
managerial perspectives.  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Keywords: Corporate image; Corporate reputation and customer loyalty

Numerous researchers in marketing have recognized
the critical roles of corporate image and corporate repu-
tation in customer's buying behaviour (Barich and
Kotler, 1991; Zeithaml, 1981). These two constructs are
particularly important in developing and maintaining
a loyalty on the part of customers (Dick and Basu, 1994;
Porter, 1985; Raj, 1985; Reynolds et al., 1974}1975). In
other respects, corporate image and corporate reputation
are generally considered as two distinct constructs which
may be strongly related. This relationship is intuitively
appealing given the idea that image and reputation are
two socially constructed entities and derived essentially
from the customer's perception of a "rm. Most of the
studies have analysed corporate image and corporate
reputation separately. At a most guarded level, some
authors have expressed a potential link between the two
concepts (Porter, 1985; Schmitt et al., 1995). More to the
point, we observe a certain overlap between the measure-
ment scales of image and reputation used in these studies.

A recent corporate image scale, for example, developed in
marketing (Javalgi et al., 1994) and the Fortune's corpo-
rate reputation scale (Fryxell and Wang, 1994) share at
least four items. These concepts are extensively used in
practice as positioning instruments to maintain or mod-
ify customer behaviour. A review of the research to date,
however, reveals little empirical evidence to support the
relationship between corporate image and corporate
reputation, as well as the widely shared beliefs regarding
the in#uence of these constructs on customer loyalty.

With this in mind, the objective of this study is to
investigate, within the services industry, the relationship
between corporate image and corporate reputation in the
customer's retention decision. Service loyalty in itself
represents the customer's rejection of competitive o!er-
ings aimed at changing buying habits and constitutes one
of the most reliable overall indicators of the service "rm's
success. The understanding of these relationships con-
tributes to establish the distinction between image and
reputation and to help management use them more e!ec-
tively in its communication strategy, thereby enhancing
the "rm's positioning. Moreover, because corporate
image and corporate reputation are considered as the
global outcomes of
legitimation or
the credentialing mechanism (Rao, 1994), their level of

abstraction may be high; consequently, they are complex
to conceptualize and di$cult to measure. Analysing these
concepts is, therefore, a challenging task, particularly in
the context of service "rms whose the products are essen-
tially intangible.

The study consists of four parts. We will present, in the
"rst instance, an overview of corporate image and corpo-
rate reputation, and their links with customer loyalty.
Secondly, the model and the methods used to investigate
the relationships between these concepts will be de-
scribed and explained. Thirdly, the results of the invest-
igation are presented and analysed. Finally, a discussion
of managerial implications concerning the use of image
and reputation as positioning tools, and future researches
related to these concepts will be provided.

Although various propositions are found in the litera-
ture as to how image is formed in people's minds, MacIn-
nis and Price (1987) report that researchers in the "eld
agree that corporate image is the result of a process. This
sensory process arises from ideas, feelings, and previous
experiences with a "rm that are retrieved from memory
and transformed into mental
(Yuille and
Catchpole, 1977). As a rule, people are exposed to reali-
ties created by the "rm and may consciously or uncon-
sciously select facts which are compatible with their
con"guration of attitudes and beliefs. These facts are
retained and thereafter retrieved from memory to recon-
struct an image when the "rm is brought to mind.

1.2. Corporate reputation

1. Literature review

1.1. Corporate image

Corporate image is described as the overall impression
made on the minds of the public about a "rm (Barich and
Kotler, 1991; Dichter, 1985; Finn, 1961; Kotler, 1982). It
is related to the various physical and behavioural at-
tributes of the "rm, such as business name, architecture,
variety of products/services, tradition, ideology, and to
the impression of quality communicated by each person
interacting with the "rm's clients. As such, corporate
image has two principal components: the functional and
the emotional (Kennedy, 1977). The functional compon-
ent is related to tangible characteristics which can be
easily measured, while the emotional component is
associated with psychological dimensions which are
manifested by feelings and attitudes towards a "rm.
These feelings are derived from individual experiences
with a "rm and from the processing of information on the
attributes that constitute functional indicators of image.
Corporate image is, therefore, the result of an aggregate
process by which the public compares and contrasts the
various attributes of "rms.

A company does not project a unique image. Rather, it
may possess various images which di!er according to
a speci"c group, such as clients, employees, and share-
holders, each of whom has di!erent types of experiences
and contacts with the company (Dowling, 1986, 1988;
Gray, 1986; Kotler, 1982). Since incongruent perceptions
can counteract favourable impressions related to a "rm's
image, the harmonization of activities is consequently
important. Often related to symbols and values, the
building of corporate image is a lengthy process which
can be improved rapidly by technological breakthroughs
and unexpected achievements or, conversely, destroyed
by neglecting the needs and expectations of the various
groups who interact with the "rm (Dichter, 1985; Herbig
et al., 1994).

`

The concept of corporate reputation has been studied
by researchers in the "elds of economics, organizational
theory and marketing. Economists analyse issues of
reputation in relation with product quality and price
(Shapiro, 1983; Wilson, 1985). Organizational
re-
searchers examine reputation as being a social identity
and portray it as an important and intangible resource
which may signi"cantly contribute to an organization's
performance, and even to its survival (Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990; Hall, 1993; Rao, 1994). Authors in market-
a
ing study reputation under the rubric of
brand equity
(Aaker, 1996) and associate it with the credibility of the
"rm (Herbig et al., 1994). Although the vocabularies
di!er making terms di$cult to de"ne (Dowling, 1986),
one can observe the consensus on the essence of the
concept of corporate reputation: it is a result of past
actions of a "rm. Corporate reputation may be viewed as
a mirror of the "rm's history which serves to communic-
ate to its target groups information regarding the quality
of its products or services in comparison with those of its
competitors (Yoon et al., 1993). Herbig and Milewicz
(1993, p. 18) de"ne reputation as
an estimation of the

can have, therefore, numerous reputations * one for
each attribute such as price, product quality, innovative-
ness, management quality * or a global reputation.
According to Wartick (1992), corporate reputation is an
`
aggregation of a single stakeholder's perceptions of how
well organizational responses are meeting the demands
a
and expectations of many organizational stakeholders.
This de"nition includes also the focal group's perception
of the "rm's ability to meet the expectations of groups
other than itself. A "rm's reputation may not be common
among all the groups. Thus, the "rm can have multiple
reputations de"ned according to each combination of
attribute and stakeholder. According to Herbig and
Milewicz (1993), corporate reputation is formed as a pro-
cess that accumulates the judgments over time of the
various groups who interact with the "rm. To better
understand this process, it is suggested to analyse the

`

229

concept of corporate reputation in association with
credibility. The credibility of a "rm is viewed as the
`
a
believability
of its stated intentions. Credibility is de-
termined by contrasting what a "rm says it will do and
what it actually does. In other words, credibility is related
to the congruence between message and action at a par-
ticular moment in time. The reputation of a "rm is built
through its credible actions. It is also fragile because the
impact of a bad action on the customer is much stronger
than that of a good action (Herbig and Milewicz, 1994).
The building of a "rm's reputation needs many good
transactions over time, while its destruction can be easily
caused by a mixed signal to markets or a bad action
directed at a particular group. The nature of a "rm's
reputation depends on the results of its perceived actions
in this period. If the "rm repeatedly succeeds to ful"ll its
promises, it should have a favourable reputation; and
inversely, the "rm's failure to respect its expressed inten-
tions may create a negative reputation (Herbig and
Milewicz, 1993).

1.3. Customer loyalty

While products have been the focus of attention in
research aimed at de"ning and measuring customer
loyalty, the construct is also of importance for services
(Dick and Basu, 1994). In the literature, brand loyalty has
many de"nitions and related measurements. Indeed,
Jacoby and Chesnut (1978), in their review of the litera-
ture, report 53 di!erent de"nitions of the construct. Even
though the typically loyal customer can be described as
the one who repeats purchases, brand loyalty cannot
always be measured by purchase behaviour since the
decision to buy a brand can be in#uenced by other
moderating variables such as social norms (Ajzen and
Fishbein, 1980) and situational
factors (Smith and
Swinyard, 1983). Similarly, a psychological dimension
expressed in the form of an attitude or preference must
also be included within the concept. In so doing, this
yields a more comprehensive view of loyalty. Indeed,
Dick and Basu (1994), in their conceptual framework of
customer loyalty, propose that loyalty is greatly a!ected
by the relative strength of the relationship between atti-
tude and behaviour. According to Sheth and Park (1974)
it is preferable to analyse purchase behaviour that is
repeated in contexts where the customer experiences
competitive pressures aimed at changing buying habits.
From this perspective, loyalty truly exists when the cus-
tomer resists pressures to switch to another brand
(Newman and Werbel, 1973; Woodside et al., 1980).

1.4. Relationship between corporate image and corporate
reputation, and their ewect on customer loyalty

How is corporate image related to corporate reputa-
tion? A review of the past research in the "eld shows little

empirical results except for some general statements. For
example, Porter (1985) suggests that a good reputation
may help a pioneer "rm building an innovative image in
the industry, while Franklin (1984) proposes that corpo-
rate reputation is a global and "nal outcome of the
process of building a corporate image. However, based
on the meaning generally accepted for each concept, one
observes that both corporate image and reputation are
the external perceptions of the "rm. The former is the
"rm's portrait made in the mind of a consumer, while the
latter is the degree of trust (or distrust) in a "rm's ability
to meet customers' expectations on a given attribute.
Corporate image and reputation are thus the results of an
aggregation process which incorporates diverse informa-
tion used by the consumer to form a perception of the
"rm. Even for a consumer who has not yet had experi-
ence with the "rm, these perceptions may be formed from
other sources of
information such as advertising or
word-of-mouth. In our opinion, the emotional compo-
nent of corporate image and corporate reputation may
share a close relationship because of the psychological
dimensions which contribute to their formation. These
dimensions are manifested by the consumer's attitudes
and beliefs which rely on past actions of the "rm or
previous experiences with the "rm. In the case of services
that are categorized as experience products whose qual-
ity can only be evaluated after consumption, given their
intangibility, corporate image and reputation both can
be used as e!ective means of predicting the outcome of
the service production process and, perhaps, considered
as the most reliable cues which signal the ability of
a service "rm to satisfy the customer's desires.

From the perspective of marketing, the impact of cor-
porate image and reputation on consumer behaviour is
well recognized in spite of the lack of empirical evidence.
Numerous authors assert that a good corporate image or
reputation helps to increase the "rm's sales and its mar-
ket share (Shapiro, 1982), and to establish and maintain
a loyal relationship with customers (Andreassen and
Lindestad, 1998; Robertson, 1993; Yoon et al., 1993).
A favourable store image can in#uence repeat patronage
(Dick and Basu, 1994). In an investigation on service
quality and customer loyalty in the commercial airline
industry, Ostrowski et al. (1993, p. 22) "nd that
a passen-
ger's image of the carrier which is based on long-term
experiences encompassing many service encounters is
more important in explaining customer loyalty than is
a
the evaluation of the current, single #ight.
They also
argue that the consumer may consider a bad experience
as an exception to his whole impression of the service
provider. In addition, this study suggests a consistent and
signi"cant relationship between the reputation of the
carrier and customer loyalty. Corporate reputation is
viewed in the study as a dimension of corporate image.
Since the exact relationship between image and repu-
tation is still unknown, it is relevant to examine the

`


230

interactions between the constructs. Despite the fact that
the formation of both corporate image and corporate
reputation is essentially based on extrinsic cues and that
both constructs are the results of an aggregation process
by which customers describe their perceptions of the "rm,
the hypothesis that corporate reputation has an impact
on corporate image appears consistent with the meaning
of these constructs. In our opinion, there are more intan-
gible and complex dimensions in the formation of a "rm's
image; therefore, the construct of image should have
a higher level of abstraction than reputation which relies
upon speci"c actions of the "rm. Moreover, the estima-
tion of a "rm's reputation may be generally more per-
sonal and more reliable regarding the past experiences of
customers with the "rm. In this context, the formation of
the concept of corporate image may require more time in
its formation and may be more di$cult to measure than
the concept of corporate reputation.

The lack of empirical results combined with the con-
#icting propositions on the relationships between reputa-
tion and image as well as their impact on consumer
loyalty justify, therefore, the current research.

2. Methods

2.1. The model

We propose to assess at the aggregate level, the main
e!ects of corporate image and reputation as well as the
in#uence of their interaction on customer loyalty. The
analysis * taking into consideration the conceptual-
ization of corporate image and corporate reputation as
level of aggregation * is carried out by means of the
following model:
CRL"♢

IMAGE#♢

REPUTATION

#♢


#♢

INTERACTION,

(1)

where CRL is the customer retention likelihood used as
an assessment of customer loyalty toward the service
"rm, IMAGE is the customer's perceptions of the image
of the service "rm, REPUTATION is the customer's
perceptions of the reputation of the service "rm, and
INTERACTION is the interaction between IMAGE and
REPUTATION.

As has been pointed out by Taylor and Baker
(1994), there is no empirical di!erence in the analysis
procedure used for the model
(1) whether image or
reputation is chosen as the moderator variable. The
advantage of this model relies on its ability to compare
the interaction e!ect with the main e!ects. Due to
multiple levels of aggregation of corporate image and
reputation, the interactions between the two constructs
may be able to explain increasing customer retention
likelihood.

The use of the moderator regression analysis allows to
test the signi"cance of the interaction term in the model
(1). In other words, it is possible to demonstrate if a vari-
able (image or reputation) as the moderator variable
interacts with the other variable as the predictor variable
to jointly a!ect customer retention likelihood. However,
the analysis used here is unable to specify the type of
moderating relationship. As has been suggested by
a number of authors (Aiken and West, 1991; Taylor,
1997; Taylor and Baker, 1994), the analysis procedure
employed here consists of estimating three regression
equations and evaluating the change in the coe$cient of
determination (R) in an hierarchical manner conforming
to the apparition order of the independent variables as
speci"ed in the model (1). Since the independent variables
are closely related, the centered data have been used to
attenuate the error caused by the potential problem of
multicollinearity (Aiken and West, 1991; Cronbach,
1987). The variance in#ation factor (VIF) of the indepen-
dent variables is used to detect the multicollinearity.
Table 3 shows the results of regression analysis and the
VIF values (varying from 1.09 to 3.34) estimated with the
various models. The values exceed the tolerance level but
they are far below 10, the critical value for a serious
problem of multicollinearity (Neter et al., 1983).

2.2. The sample

The data was collected in three service industries: retail
services, telecommunication services and educational ser-
vices by using convenience samples. In the retail sector,
222 consumers were intercepted in shopping malls
located in a mid-size city in Eastern Canada. The selec-
tion of these customers was based on their answers to
a question regarding the most visited store. The focal
store was chosen among "ve well-known companies in
the area. In all, three quarters of the respondents parti-
cipating in the survey said they shopped at least once
a month at this store. For the telecommunication servi-
ces, the data was collected by personal interviews via
telephone with a sample of 171 clients of a major long-
distance telephone company selected among four well-
known companies o!ering similar services. Also, three
quarters of the customers interviewed in telecommunica-
tion services said that they were frequent users of long-
distance telephone, using services at least six times per
month with the same company. In the educational sector,
questionnaires were distributed to a sample of 395 fresh-
men and seniors of a faculty of business administration.
These students were chosen because they could switch
faculty or even university, or continue to do business
with the same service provider (enter in a graduate pro-
gram) shortly in the future. In each service industry, the
majority of respondents were customers who had main-
tained a stable relationship with the service provider over
a relatively long period of time. As such, this element may


N. Nguyen, G. Leblanc / Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services 8 (2001) 227}236

231

be determinant on their perception of corporate image
and reputation, and their buying behaviour. The ques-
tionnaire used in the surveys was designed to obtain
individual perceptions and intentions toward the focal
company in each service industry.

2.3. The measurement

To operationalize corporate image and corporate
reputation as presented in the model (1), we propose to
use direct measures in the absence of a consensus on the
valid scales for these constructs. The operationalization
is based on three direct measures for each construct.
Regarding the measure of customer retention likelihood,
four behavioural intentions items were used as measures
of loyalty, namely the customer's intention to consider
the company his "rst choice for this service, the cus-
tomer's intention to continue to do business with the
company, the customer's intention to recommend the
company as the best in the area, and his intention to
encourage friends and relatives to do business with the
company. These four items are similar to those used by
Zeithaml et al. (1996) in a study of four companies which
provide services to end or business customers. These
direct measures are not made up by intrinsic descriptors
of the constructs. However, the advantage of the ap-
proach taken in this study lies on the utilization of indices
formed from multiple indicators that are summed and
averaged rather than the single-item measures. All of the
aforementioned constructs were measured with the use of
a seven-point Likert-type agreement scale with anchors
of strongly disagree (1) and strongly agree (7). The items
used for corporate image, corporate reputation and cus-
tomer retention likelihood are presented in the appendix.
The correlation matrix of these items obtained from the
pooled data is presented in Table 1. The purpose of the
correlation analysis is to assess the convergent validity of
three indices representing corporate image, corporate
reputation and customer retention likelihood, as well as
the discriminant validity between the "rst two constructs.

As can be observed in Table 1, the coe$cients of correla-
tion within indices (varying from 0.60 to 0.87) are gener-
ally greater than those between indices (varying from 0.39
to 0.66). These coe$cients of correlation show that the
validity of these measures is relatively acceptable. More-
over, Table 2 reveals that the reliability of the mea-
sures used in the model is also adequate according to
Nunnally's rule of interpretation (1978), with coe$cients
alpha varying from 0.76 to 0.93.

3. Results and discussion

Before estimating the model (1), a tipping analysis was
performed on each of the three service settings. This type
of analysis helps to compare respondents having extreme
evaluations of corporate image and reputation and to
predict whether these variables are related to customer
retention likelihood (McClelland, 1998). The sample of
respondents in each service sector is segmented by corpo-
rate image and reputation following three levels: high,
medium and low. These levels correspond to opinions
expressed by respondents on the seven-point scale used
to measure corporate image and reputation: where
high"6 or 7, medium"3, 4 or 5 and low"1 or 2. The
partition of respondents obtained by this criterion may
di!er from sample to sample. However, as shown in
Fig. 1, the results of the partition are close to the distri-
bution suggested for tipping analysis: high"top 20% of
respondents, medium"mid 60% and low"bottom
20%.

In order to test the dependency between corporate
image and corporate reputation, a ♻ test was performed
in each service sector. In telecommunication and retail
services, because of the insu$cient number of respon-
dents in high-low cells, a series of ♻ test was performed
only on high-medium cells and medium-low cells. The
results indicate a signi"cant interdependence between
corporate image and corporate reputation on these
two level combinations (p(0.001 for all ♻ test). In

educational services, the data are available for a unique
♻ test and the results are also very signi"cant (p(0.001).
Fig. 1 also reveals that customer retention likelihood
seems to be signi"cantly associated with the levels of
evaluation of corporate image and reputation. Indeed,
the more the perception of corporate image and reputa-
tion is favourable the higher are the retention likelihood
scores. For example, Fig. 1(A) shows that in telecommu-
nication services the average retention likelihood de-
creases from 27.46 to 24.96, (di!erence between means
signi"cant at p(0.001), as the perception of corporate
image decreases from the high to medium level with the
perception of corporate reputation maintained at the
high level. The decrease in the retention likelihood scores
is also observed from a higher cell to a lower cell in all
three service industries. This tendency is more important
when changes in evaluations of both perceived corporate
image and reputation occur. In Fig. 1, this decrease in the
retention likelihood scores can be observed on the
diagonals. These scores correspond to the high}high,
medium}medium and low}low cells formed by corporate
image and reputation assessments where the average
retention likelihood scores are, respectively, 27.46, 23.38
and 15.40 in telecommunication services; 24.80, 17.09 and
12.52 in retail services; and 26.03, 20.47 and 13.83 in
educational services. It is recognized that not all cus-
tomers retained have a very high corporate image and
a very favourable reputation of a "rm. Likewise, not all
customers lost view the "rm negatively on its image and
reputation. However, these results allow us to predict
a strong relationship between customer loyalty and cor-
porate image and reputation.

The regression analysis performed here attempts to
test statistically the signi"cance of the interaction term
representing the cross-product of two variables, corpo-
rate image and corporate reputation in the model (1). The
test is able to con"rm if a moderating relationship exists,
but its exact form is not known given the exploratory
nature of this research as well as the lack of consensus in
the literature regarding the relationship image-reputa-
tion.

Table 3 reveals that the regression coe$cients asso-
ciated with the image/reputation interaction term is sig-
ni"cant in the three service industries tested. However,
because of the small magnitude of these coe$cients and

the exploratory nature of the study, the interpretation of
these results should be made with caution. In spite of this,
the signi"cance of the interaction term found in all three
industries is worth noting given the di$culty to detect
statistically reliable interactions as reported by numerous
researchers in the "eld (McClelland and Judd, 1993;
Taylor and Baker, 1994). Consequently, based on the
statistical results, we propose that the addition of the
interaction between corporate image and corporate
reputation contributes to explain better a customer's
retention decision. In other words, it is suggested that
one variable (corporate image or corporate reputation)
intervenes as a moderator variable to enhance the impact
of the other variable on customer loyalty. In addition, the
results in Table 3 show also that the beta coe$cients
representing the direct e!ect of corporate image and
corporate reputation on customer retention likelihood
are strongly signi"cant. These two constructs, along with
their interaction, are the only independent variables used
in our regression model in order to explain customer
retention likelihood. Thus, the results obtained here
reveal the novel nature of the current study which as-
sesses extrinsic cues exclusively in the explanatory model
of customer loyalty, given the fact that the previous
research has demonstrated largely that the intrinsic char-
acteristics of the service in#uence especially customer
loyalty (Cronin and Taylor, 1992; Fornell, 1992). Both
constructs of corporate image and corporate reputation
are derived essentially from extrinsic characteristics of
the service such as price, contact personnel, and physical
environment.

Since the regression coe$cients for the interaction
term are all positive in the three industries, this indicates
that the degree of customer loyalty has a tendency to be
higher as the perceptions of both corporate image and
corporate reputation are strongly favourable. This is not
a surprising revelation, but it is empirical evidence which
supports the widely shared beliefs about the causal rela-
tionship between corporate image and corporate reputa-
tion.

The nature of the results does not allow us to go
further regarding the exact form or type of the moderat-
ing relationship between corporate image and corporate
reputation. However, based on their meanings generally
acceptable in the literature, we might hypothesize that

corporate reputation is an antecedent of corporate
image. This argument is also in agreement with the re-
sults observed in a very few studies on the subject. For
example, Ostrowski et al. (1993) have considered the
reputation of a commercial airline company as a dimen-
sion of its corporate image. If both corporate reputation
and corporate image are formed as a process which
accumulates judgments over time, the former is usually
referred to as a speci"c action or transaction with a "rm,
while the latter is used as an instrument of identi"cation
or comparison of a "rm to others. For example,
in
a context of imperfect information, the customer has
tendency to use corporate reputation to infer the quality
of a speci"c product or service o!ered by a "rm or to
predict its future action (Herbig and Milewicz, 1993;
Wartick, 1992; Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). The same

customer considers corporate image as a global impres-
sion of the "rm regarding its ability to meet his or her
needs (Barich and Kotler, 1991).

Several potential limitations of this study should be
noted before discussing the research and managerial
implications. First and foremost, the e$cacy of the direct
measures used to assess corporate image and reputation
must be considered (Peterson and Wilson, 1992). The
reliability and, especially, the discriminant validity of the
measures in this study are not as strongly conclusive as
expected. However, at this stage, the identi"cation of the
indicators that best represent these two constructs con-
tinues to challenge researchers in the "eld. Second, by
ignoring higher-order terms in the model (1), the inter-
pretation of regression coe$cients may be subject to
substantial errors (Aiken and West, 1991). In this regard,

Taylor (1997) has proposed an alternative approach that
consists of an assessment of the apparent prevalence of
higher order and interaction e!ects in various models
relating predictor variables (corporate image and reputa-
tion) to dependent variable (customer retention likeli-
hood). Nonetheless,
the complexity of regression-based
models capturing higher order and interactive terms
grows exponentially with an increasing number of inde-
a
pendent variables
(Taylor, 1997, p. 154). As the purpose
of the current study was to investigate the interaction
between corporate image and reputation, the traditional
approach of regression with moderator variable seems to
be appropriate. Third, the variations in the values of the
coe$cient of determination regarding the interaction term
are statistically signi"cant but relatively weak. This may
also result in a limitation of the contribution of the current
study. Finally, the data were collected from a convenient
sample of consumers and students. As such, the study does
not allow for the generalization of the "ndings across the
services industry or even for the studied sectors.

4. Implications and conclusion

The present research contributes to the body of know-
ledge by testing the moderating relationship between
corporate image and corporate reputation. However,
given the great diversity of service industries, it would be
helpful to realize similar studies in other service settings.
An interesting extension would be to include other
moderating in#uences which may be determinant in the
relationship between corporate image, corporate re-
putation and customer loyalty. For example, tangible
elements, such as contact personnel and physical envi-
ronment, might be used given their e!ect on corporate

image. In other respects, the "ndings in the current study,
added to the confusion between corporate image and
corporate reputation as we have pointed out in reviewing
the literature, express perhaps the need for an assessment
of the redundancy in these two constructs by using a sys-
tematic approach suggested by Singh (1991). Regarding
methodology, it should be more e$cient to perform the
moderator regression analysis by using a valid scale for
each of the two constructs of corporate image and corpo-
rate reputation. It is thus justi"ed to have a full under-
standing of the meaning of these constructs from the
point of view of consumers in order to identify the realis-
tic and relevant dimensions that constitute both con-
structs. For example, such dimensions may be identi"ed
by means of focus group or in-depth interviews with
consumers chosen in various sectors of services. These
methods would allow the gathering of information perti-
nent to the components of corporate image and corpo-
rate reputation as social entities. The identi"cation
of these components is a part of the building process
of measurement scales for these constructs.

Regarding managerial implications, an important rev-
elation of this study is the in#uence of extrinsic character-
istics of the service o!ering on the customer's retention
decision. This result suggests that managers of service
organizations should not consider exclusively intrinsic
attributes in their communication strategy. These at-
tributes are usually translated into customer satisfaction
(Anderson and Sullivan, 1993; Oliva et al., 1992; Wood-
side et al., 1989) or service quality (Bitner, 1990; Dick and
Basu, 1994; Fornell, 1992) which are considered the pre-
dominant antecedents of customer loyalty. In service
industries, the association between corporate image or
corporate reputation and a company's o!ering is much
more di$cult to pin-point because of the intangibility of

235

the service. From this perspective, other tangible charac-
teristics, such as those of the service provider, may be
used to make its image more easily discernible. In order
to in#uence consumer behaviour, service organizations
should employ arguments based on contact personnel
and physical environment, the hope being that, in the
eyes of the consumer, these elements constitute the bene-
"ts promised in the service transaction. For example, an
airline company would emphasize the competence of its
#ight attendants or seat comfort as service quality indices
in a strategy to create a favourable image. Service organ-
izations should exploit the presence of contact elements
in its advertising to make the intangible tangible. This is
also an e$cient way to create a more compelling image.
In numerous services provided by banks, insurance com-
panies, educational or professional institutions, the mer-
chandise component is not a part of the service act.
Moreover, the client's presence and participation are
often required in the service delivery process. Therefore,
contact elements may be considered as critical factors
which determine the client's perception of the image or
reputation of service organizations. Regarding corporate
communication, the results of the study suggest that
marketing managers should emphasize and coordinate
elements of corporate reputation which is strongly signif-
icant in the creation of a favourable image.

The lack of evidence and research on the causal
relationship between corporate image and corporate
reputation initiated this exploratory study on interaction
image/reputation in certain service settings. The results
show a signi"cant relationship between the two concepts
and should encourage us to pursue additional studies in
order to determine the exact nature of this relationship.
