This study extends the developing body of literature on supply chain integration (SCI), which is the
degree to which a manufacturer strategically collaborates with its supply chain partners and
collaboratively manages intra- and inter-organizational processes, in order to achieve effective and
efﬁcient ﬂows of products and services, information, money and decisions, to provide maximum value to
the customer. The previous research is inconsistent in its ﬁndings about the relationship between SCI
and performance. We attribute this inconsistency to incomplete deﬁnitions of SCI, in particular, the
tendency to focus on customer and supplier integration only, excluding the important central link of
internal integration. We study the relationship between three dimensions of SCI, operational and
business performance, from both a contingency and a conﬁguration perspective. In applying the
contingency approach, hierarchical regression was used to determine the impact of individual SCI
dimensions (customer, supplier and internal integration) and their interactions on performance. In the
conﬁguration approach, cluster analysis was used to develop patterns of SCI, which were analyzed in
terms of SCI strength and balance. Analysis of variance was used to examine the relationship between SCI
pattern and performance. The ﬁndings of both the contingency and conﬁguration approach indicated
that SCI was related to both operational and business performance. Furthermore, the results indicated
that internal and customer integration were more strongly related to improving performance than
supplier integration.

1. Introduction

Researchers have long articulated the need for a close,
integrated relationship between manufacturers and their supply
chain partners (e.g., Lambert et al., 1978; Armistead and Mapes,
1993). However, only recently has there been a call for a systematic
approach to supply chain integration (SCI), as increasingly global
competition has caused organizations to rethink the need for
cooperative, mutually beneﬁcial supply chain partnerships (Lam-
bert and Cooper, 2000; Wisner and Tan, 2000) and the joint
improvement of inter-organizational processes has become a high
priority (Zhao et al., 2008).

The existing research on SCI, however, is characterized by
evolving deﬁnitions and dimensions (Van der Vaart and van Donk,
2008). While some focuses on the individual dimensions of SCI
(Cousins and Menguc, 2006; Homburg and Stock, 2004; Koufteros
et al., 2007), in particular customer and supplier integration, others
use various omnibus deﬁnitions (Armistead and Mapes, 1993;
Rosenzweig et al., 2003), examining SCI as a single construct. In
addition, many conceptualizations of SCI are incomplete, leaving
out the important central link of internal integration.

These incomplete and evolving conceptualizations have led to
inconsistent ﬁndings about the relationship between SCI and
performance (e.g. Devaraj et al., 2007; Germain and Iyer, 2006; Das
et al., 2006; Stank et al., 2001a). In order to fully understand SCI and
its relationship to performance, there is a need to examine both
how individual dimensions of SCI are related to different
dimensions of performance, as well as how patterns of SCI are
related to different dimensions of performance. This suggests
taking both a contingency and a conﬁguration approach to
studying SCI, echoing the appeal of Harland et al. (2007). In
particular, it is important to apply both approaches within a single

study, in order to determine whether the ﬁndings are due to the
relationship between SCI and performance or are an artifact of the
data collection and survey design.

We build on this foundation, applying a contingency approach
to examine the relationship between internal, customer and
supplier integration and both operational and business perfor-
mance. We suggest that customer and supplier integration
moderate the relationship between internal
integration and
performance, building upon its foundation. We then apply a
conﬁguration approach to delve more deeply into how the
dimensions of SCI work together, in order to continue to learn
about how various SCI patterns are related to performance. In
relating SCI patterns to performance, we examine both operational
and business performance measures, which allows drawing more
comprehensive conclusions.

An important question that this allows us to consider is whether
SCI patterns that are either strong or balanced are more strongly
related to speciﬁc performance measures, or whether organizations
that have supply chains that are well integrated (strength) across the
board (balance) will have better performance on all dimensions.
These questions are important to decision makers because they
provide insights about strategies for pursuing SCI.

2. Theoretical background

2.1. Deﬁnition of SCI

The SCI construct is relatively new as an area of research,
although there is an extensive body of research on unidimensional
supply chain relationships, examining collaborative relationships
between a manufacturer and either its customers or suppliers
(Paulraj et al., 2008; Mabert and Venkataramanan, 1998; Spekman
et al., 1998; Fawcett and Magnan, 2002). While some focus on dyadic
relationships with supply chain partners (Lee and Whang, 2001),
others focus on managing a supply chain as a single system, rather
than attempting to individually optimize fragmented subsystems
(Vickery et al., 2003; Naylor et al., 1999; Bowersox and Morash,
1989; Hammer, 1990; Stevens, 1989). While some SCI deﬁnitions
emphasize ﬂows of materials and parts, others focus more on ﬂows
of information, resources and cash. Although these descriptions
touch many of the critical elements of SCI, they are broad in focus. In
addition, most fail to consider the strategic nature of SCI.

We build upon the existing literature on the SCI construct,
including the manufacturer (internal integration) and extending
from it both directions (customer and supplier integration), and
building upon its gaps to develop a parsimonious deﬁnition of SCI.
The term ‘‘integration’’ is deﬁned as ‘‘the uniﬁed control of a
number of successive or similar economic or especially industrial
processes formerly carried on independently’’ (Webster’s 1966, p.
1175). Applying this in a supply chain context, we deﬁne SCI as the
degree to which a manufacturer strategically collaborates with its
supply chain partners and collaboratively manages intra- and
inter-organization processes. The goal is to achieve effective and
efﬁcient ﬂows of products and services, information, money and
decisions, to provide maximum value to the customer at low cost
and high speed (Bowersox et al., 1999; Frohlich and Westbrook,
2001; Naylor et al., 1999).

This deﬁnition includes several important elements. First, we
highlight the importance of strategic collaboration, which is an
ongoing partnership to achieve mutually beneﬁcial strategic goals.
It engenders mutual
increases contract duration and
encourages efﬁcient conﬂict resolution and sharing of information,
rewards and risks (Ellram, 1990; Heide and John, 1990; Poirier and
Reiter, 1996). While operational coordination can only lead to
operational beneﬁts, strategic coordination provides both opera-
tional and strategic beneﬁts (Sanders, 2008). This deﬁnition also

trust,

emphasizes intra- and inter-organization processes, since SCI is
comprehensive and encompasses a variety of activities, including
many that are focused on materials, transportation and admin-
istrative tasks (Bowersox and Morash, 1989; Hillebrand and
Biemans, 2003). Finally, we emphasize the customer-facing nature
of SCI, stating that its primary objective is to provide maximum
value for the customer.

2.2. Dimensions of SCI

Consideration of the dimensionality of SCI is important in
understanding the way that the individual dimensions operate, as
well as how they function jointly. Appendix A contains a summary of
important previous studies investigating various dimensions of SCI.
While some authors investigated SCI as a unidimensional construct
(Armistead and Mapes, 1993; Marquez et al., 2004; Rosenzweig
et al., 2003), others have broken SCI into internal and external
integration (Campbell and Sankaranl, 2005; Morash and Clinton,
1998; O’Leary-Kelly and Flores, 2002; Pagell, 2004; Petersen et al.,
2005; Ragatz et al., 2002; Stank et al., 2001b; Stanley and Wisner,
2001; Zailani and Rajagopal, 2005), and some have taken an even
broader perspective, including multiple dimensions (Droge et al.,
2004; Gimenez and Ventura, 2005; Koufteros et al., 2005;
Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Stank et al., 2001a; Vickery et al.,
2003). While each of these dimensions represents an important
aspect of SCI, there is a great deal of overlap between them, making it
difﬁcult to untangle their relationships.

We argue that the diverse dimensions of SCI can ultimately be
collapsed into three dimensions: customer, supplier and internal
integration. Customer and supplier integration are commonly
referred to as external integration, which is the degree to which a
manufacturer partners with its external partners to structure
inter-organizational strategies, practices and processes into
collaborative, synchronized processes (Stank et al., 2001b).
Customer integration involves core competencies derived from
coordination with critical customers, whereas supplier integration
involves core competencies related to coordination with critical
suppliers (Bowersox et al., 1999). In contrast, internal integration
focuses on activities within a manufacturer. It is the degree to
which a manufacturer structures its own organizational strategies,
practices and processes into collaborative, synchronized processes,
in order to fulﬁll its customers’ requirements (Cespedes, 1996;
Kahn and Mentzer, 1996; Kingman-Brundage et al., 1995) and
efﬁciently interact with its suppliers.

Internal integration and external integration play different roles
in the context of SCI. While internal integration recognizes that the
departments and functions within a manufacturer should function
as part of an integrated process, external integration recognizes the
importance of establishing close, interactive relationships with
customers and suppliers. Both perspectives are important in
allowing supply chain members to act in a concerted way, to
maximize the value of the supply chain.

2.3. Contingency approach to SCI

Contingency theory (Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967; Thompson,
1967) argues that no theory or method can be applied in all
instances, in other words, that there is no one best way to design an
organization (Scott and Cole, 2000). It employs a reductionist
approach, treating an organization as decomposable into inde-
pendent elements (Sinha et al., 2005). The environment that an
organization operates within shapes its structures and processes.
This suggests that organizations should match their structures and
processes to their environment, in order to maximize performance
(Donaldson, 2001; Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967), and customers and
suppliers are an important part of a manufacturer’s environment.

B.B. Flynn et al. / Journal of Operations Management 28 (2010) 58–71

Structural contingency theory (Chandler, 1962; Lawrence and
Lorsch, 1967; Galbraith, 1973) suggests that how well an
organization performs depends on the extent to which the strategy
that it seeks to pursue is aligned with its design. This alignment
between strategy and performance is described as ‘‘ﬁt’’ in the
strategic management literature (Drazin et al., 1985; Venkatraman
and Prescott, 1990; Milgrom and Roberts, 1995). Applied to SCI,
structural contingency theory suggests that
the individual
dimensions of SCI should be aligned, in order to achieve the best
performance.

2.3.1. Relationship between internal integration and performance

Just as internal ﬁt indicates consistency among structural
characteristics within an organization (Drazin et al., 1985; Venkatra-
man and Prescott, 1990; Milgrom and Roberts, 1995), internal
integration recognizes that different departments and functional
areas within a ﬁrm should operate as part of an integrated process.
Because internal integration breaks down functional barriers and
engenders cooperation in order to meet the requirements of
customers, rather than operating within the functional silos
associated with traditional departmentalization and specialization,
it is expected to be related to performance. Although manufacturers
may maintain a functional organization structure, customer orders
ﬂow across functions and activities. When an order is delayed,
customers do not care which function caused the delay; they simply
want to know whether the order has been fulﬁlled. This calls for an
integrated customer order fulﬁllment process, in which all involved
activities and functions work together. Information sharing, joint
planning, cross-functional teams and working together are impor-
tant elements of this process.

Selecting the appropriate performance measures is challenging,
due to the inherent complexity and interdependence of supply
chains. While Chen and Paulraj (2004a) argued that ﬁnancial
performance should be the main measure of SC performance
because of the shareholder proﬁt motive, others have described the
limitations of relying solely on ﬁnancial measures of performance
(Dixon et al., 1990; Eccles and Pyburn, 1992; Hall, 1983; Johnson
and Kaplan, 1987; Skinner, 1971). Van Hoek (1998) and Beamon
(1999) suggested that SC performance measurement should
include operational indicators, such as customer service and the
ability to respond to a changing environment. Neely et al. (1995)
listed cost, time, quality, delivery and ﬂexibility as important
measures of operational performance.

Although some authors found no direct relationship between
internal integration and operational performance (Koufteros et al.,
2005; Gimenez and Ventura, 2005), others found a positive
relationship between internal integration and operational perfor-
mance, including process efﬁciency (Saeed et al., 2005) and logistics
service performance (Germain and Iyer, 2006; Stank et al., 2001a,b).
We argue that internal integration is the base for SCI and will be
positively related to operational performance. Thus, we propose:

H1a. Internal integration is positively related to the operational
performance of the manufacturer within a supply chain.

Stank et al. (2001b) described internal and customer integration
as the most signiﬁcant differentiators of overall ﬁrm performance,
and although the literature on the relationship between SCI and
business performance is quite extensive (e.g. Droge et al., 2004;
Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001, 2002; O’Leary-Kelly and Flores,
2002; Rosenzweig et al., 2003; Swink et al., 2007; Zailani and
Rajagopal, 2005), it is inconclusive. For example, while Droge et al.
(2004) found that both internal and external integration were
related to ﬁnancial performance and market share, Swink et al.
(2007) found that the individual dimensions of SCI had differing
impacts on business performance. More typical are studies that

indirectly link SCI to business performance, for example, through
improved product innovation (Koufteros et al., 2005) or opera-
tional performance, or through a mediated or moderated relation-
ship (Vickery et al., 2003; Rosenzweig et al., 2003; O’Leary-Kelly
and Flores, 2002). Thus, we propose:

H1b. Internal integration is positively related to the business
performance of the manufacturer within a supply chain.

2.3.2. Relationship of customer and supplier integration to
performance

According to structural contingency theory, external ﬁt
indicates consistency between an organizational structure and
the strategy it pursues in response to its external environment. As
its external environment (in a supply chain, the characteristics of
its customers and suppliers) changes, a manufacturer should
respond by developing, selecting and implementing strategies to
maintain ﬁt, not only among internal structural characteristics, but
also with its external environment (Hambrick, 1983; Kotha and
Nair, 1995; Tushman and Nadler, 1978). Thus, customer and
supplier integration build on a manufacturer’s internal integration
to form an important element of SCI.

A close relationship between customers and the manufacturer
offers opportunities for improving the accuracy of demand
information, which reduces the manufacturer’s product design
and production planning time and inventory obsolescence,
allowing it to be more responsive to customer needs. Because
customer integration generates opportunities for leveraging the
intelligence embedded in collaborative processes,
it enables
manufacturers to reduce costs, create greater value and detect
demand changes more quickly. Customer integration has been
found to be related to customer satisfaction, both directly
(Homburg and Stock, 2004) and indirectly, through its relationship
to product development and innovation (Koufteros et al., 2005;
Song and Di Benedetto, 2008).

In an integrated supply chain, development of a strong strategic
partnership with suppliers will facilitate their understanding and
anticipation of the manufacturer’s needs, in order to better meet its
changing requirements. This mutual exchange of information
about products, processes, schedules and capabilities helps
manufacturers develop their production plans and produce goods
on time, improving delivery performance. By developing a good
understanding of the manufacturer’s operations, suppliers achieve
a high level of customer service, which,
in turn, helps the
manufacturers improve their customer service. Supplier integra-
tion has been found to be related to product development
performance (Petersen et al., 2005; Koufteros et al., 2007; Ragatz
et al., 2002) and supplier communications performance (Cousins
and Menguc, 2006). Others, however, have found no relationship
between supplier integration and operational performance (Stank
et al., 2001b) or a negative relationship (Koufteros et al., 2005;
Stank et al., 2001a; Swink et al., 2007).

The work of stage theorists suggests that internal integration is
a prerequisite for both customer and supplier integration (Morash
and Clinton, 1998). Their argument rests on the notion that
external uncertainties and linkages must be internally absorbed
into the proper places in an organization and that the primary
impediment to achieving the beneﬁts of external SCI is intraorga-
nizational barriers to internal integration. Customer and supplier
integration extend internal integration’s elimination of functional
silos to span across organizational boundaries. Thus,

H2a. Customer and supplier integration are positively related to
the operational performance of the manufacturer within a supply
chain, given the relationship between internal integration and
operational performance.

H2b. Customer and supplier integration are positively related to
the business performance of the manufacturer within a supply
chain, given the relationship between internal integration and
business performance.

2.3.3. Moderating effects

Contingency theory also suggests that individual dimensions of
SCI will interact to affect performance. A manufacturer’s efforts in
external supplier and customer integration help it take full
advantage of its internal integration, in order to achieve better
operational performance.

Germain and Iyer (2006) found that the interaction between
internal
integration and customer integration was related to
logistics performance, which in turn was related to ﬁnancial
performance. Droge et al. (2004) found that internal integration
moderated the effect of external integration on performance, and
Devaraj et al. (2007) found that customer integration moderated
the relationship between supplier integration and performance.
We hypothesize two- and three-way interactions between the
dimensions of SCI.

H3a. Customer and supplier integration will moderate the rela-
tionship between internal integration and operational perfor-
mance.

H3b. Customer and supplier integration will moderate the rela-
tionship between internal integration and business performance.

2.4. Conﬁguration approach

Although the perspectives provided by the contingency
approach contribute to the knowledge about SCI, this approach
is somewhat limited. While it allows detailed examination of the
relationship between the dimensions of SCI and performance, its
reductionism causes it to be unable to handle complicated
organizational phenomena from a holistic perspective. Because
an organization is composed of many contingencies (Siggelkow,
2001; Sinha et al., 2005), drawing conclusions about speciﬁc
contingent relationships can be challenging. Results from a
contingency approach can also be difﬁcult to interpret when
some of the interactions are nonsigniﬁcant. A third issue related to
the contingency approach is the multicollinearity between the
independent variables that comprise a related construct like SCI
that is often present.

This suggests that additional analysis, based on a conﬁguration
perspective, will be useful in analyzing the relationship between
SCI and performance. Conﬁguration theory describes an organiza-
tion as a set of interrelated activities. Rather than the pairwise
the contingency approach focuses on, a
relationships that
conﬁguration approach views ﬁt
‘‘gestalts’’ or
conﬁgurations of various elements and their relationships (Drazin
et al., 1985). The conﬁguration approach argues that, when
organizational elements are consistent with each other, a holistic,
rather than piecemeal, analysis should be applied (Miller, 1986;
Ward et al., 1996). This approach is very useful in handling the co-
alignment or ﬁt among multiple variables, such as the dimensions
of SCI, and it is appropriate for handling complex relationships.

in terms of

2.4.1. Conﬁgurations of SCI

The conﬁguration approach focuses on establishing patterns or
proﬁles. According to conﬁguration theory (Miller, 1986), the
alignment of strategy and systems or practices is reﬂected in the
patterns observed in practice. This suggests a need to articulate
emergent patterns of SCI. The inductive conﬁguration approach is
data driven, applying an analytical approach to empirically

develop a taxonomy. Taxonomies contribute to both theory and
practice by providing ‘‘parsimonious descriptions which are useful
in discussion, research and pedagogy’’ (Miller and Roth, 1994, p.
286) and revealing ‘‘insights into the underlying structures of
competition from the viewpoint of operations’’ (Zhao et al., 2006b,
p. 622). They allow for the possibility of other patterns, which may
have not been part of a theoretical typology, to emerge.

Frohlich and Westbrook (2001) developed a taxonomy of
different patterns or ‘‘arcs’’ of SCI and showed that they were
related to performance differences. Their taxonomy included ﬁve
types, including inward-, periphery- supplier-, customer- and
outward-facing SCI types. It was based only on customer and
supplier integration; it did not consider internal integration. In
addition, their cutoff points were based on quartiles, so there are
not necessarily signiﬁcant gaps between members of different
groups. This suggests that an analytical grouping approach that
develops groups based on signiﬁcant gaps between them, such as
cluster analysis, may lead to a better understanding of various SCI
patterns and how they are related to performance.

Since different companies may place differing degrees of
emphasis on the individual dimensions of SCI, various conﬁgura-
tions of SCI exist. These patterns can be described in terms of their
SCI strength and balance. SCI strength is the level or extent to which
SCI activities are carried out. Many previous studies (Frohlich and
Westbrook, 2001; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Petersen et al.,
2005; Devaraj et al., 2007) have measured the strength of SCI,
providing a benchmark for comparison. In contrast, SCI balance is
the extent to which a company pays equal attention to all three
dimensions of SCI. The literature indicates that manufacturers may
not place equal emphasis on every dimension of SCI. While some
may have well integrated internal systems, they may not have
extended this approach to customers and suppliers, while others
may be strong in customer or supplier integration and weaker in
their internal integration.

There is a need for a taxonomy which is based on signiﬁcant
gaps between the groups, in order to have better insights about the
relationship between SCI patterns and performance. In addition,
the literature is notably lacking a taxonomy of SCI
that
incorporates internal integration, as well as customer and supplier
integration. Thus, we propose:

H4. An emergent taxonomy of manufacturers can be developed,
based on their patterns of supplier, internal and customer inte-
gration.

2.4.2. Impact of SCI patterns on performance

Conﬁguration theory suggests that the emergent patterns of SCI
will be related to operational performance in different ways. It
argues that organizations perform better when they develop better
conﬁgurations of interconnected elements (Drazin et al., 1985;
Sinha et al., 2005). For example, a SCI pattern which is stronger in
customer integration is likely to have a stronger relationship to
customer satisfaction than a pattern which is stronger in supplier
integration. Furthermore, the relationship of SCI to performance
may be determined by the pattern SCI, in terms of the strength and
balance of the three dimensions. Therefore, we propose:

H5a. The patterns of SCI are related to the operational performance
of the manufacturer within a supply chain.

Adding internal integration to the dimensions that Frohlich and
Westbrook (2001) used in their taxonomy is expected to yield
similar results, in terms of their relationship with performance,
thus, we expect that manufacturers with the strongest overall SCI
will have the best business performance. Supplier and internal
integration help manufacturers reduce mistakes and waste,


62

B.B. Flynn et al. / Journal of Operations Management 28 (2010) 58–71

through information sharing and joint planning, which is directly
related to business performance. Customer integration will help
the manufacturer better understand customer requirements and
better forecast customer demand, thus allowing the manufacturer
to provide better quality products at lower cost and more ﬂexibly.
These will, in turn, lead to better ﬁnancial performance by the
manufacturer. Furthermore the effectiveness of SCI will be related
to conﬁguration of the three SCI dimensions. Thus, we propose:

H5b. The patterns of SCI are related to the business performance of
the manufacturer within a supply chain.

3. Research methodology

3.1. Questionnaire design and measures

We surveyed the literature to identify valid measures for
related constructs and adapted existing scales to measure internal
integration (Narasimhan and Kim, 2002), customer and supplier
integration (Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Morash and Clinton,
1998), operational performance (Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001;
Beamon, 1999; Vickery et al., 2003) and business performance
(Narasimhan and Kim, 2002). When there were no reliable and
valid existing measures, we developed new measures, based on our
understanding of the constructs and our observations during
company visits and interviews. The indicators were all measured
using a seven-point Likert scale, where higher values indicated
stronger integration or better performance. The complete scales
are listed in Appendix B.

Since the scales drawn from the literature were in English, the
initial questionnaire was developed in English, then translated into
Chinese by an operations management professor in China. The
Chinese version was then translated back into English by another
operations management professor, and the translated English
version was checked against the original English version for
discrepancies. In mainland China, we used the Chinese version of
the questionnaire.
In Hong Kong, a bilingual version of the
questionnaire was used.

There were two preliminary assessments of the questionnaire.
First, we submitted the questionnaire to academicians and supply
chain executives for their review. Next, we pre-tested it in a sample
of ﬁfteen companies, which we visited to conduct face-to-face

discussions. Based on the feedback, we modiﬁed the wording of
some questions and added or deleted some, in order to ensure that
the items were understandable and relevant to practices in China.

3.2. Sampling and data collection

Data were collected from manufacturing companies in China.
Because of China’s size and economic diversity (Zhao et al., 2006a),
we strategically selected ﬁve cities representing different stages of
economic development. Chongqing is in the early stages of
economic reform and market formation, while Tianjin reﬂects
an average level. Guangzhou and Shanghai have enjoyed a higher
degree of economic reform and marketization, and Hong Kong is
one of the freest economies in the world. Although most Hong
Kong companies house their manufacturing operations in main-
land China, they use Hong Kong as the hub from which to control
and direct the ﬂows of materials, ﬁnished goods, information,
logistics and money.

The research unit was the manufacturing company and its
supply chain. To obtain a representative sample, we used the
Yellow Pages of China Telecom in each of the four mainland China
cities and the directory of the Chinese Manufacturers Association
in Hong Kong as our sampling pool. For each randomly selected
manufacturer, we identiﬁed a key informant, who typically had a
title such as supply chain manager, CEO/president, vice president
or director, and was knowledgeable about the company’s internal
and external processes. We contacted the key informants by
telephone, in order to obtain their preliminary agreement to
participate.

We mailed the questionnaire, along with a cover letter
highlighting the study’s objectives and potential contributions.
Follow-up telephone calls and mailings were used to improve the
response rate (Frohlich, 2002) and address potential missing data
issues. Out of 4569 companies contacted, a total of 1356
questionnaires were distributed, and there were 617 usable
questionnaires returned. The response rate was 13.5% based on
the number of companies contacted via telephone and 45.5% based
on the number of questionnaires distributed, comparable to other
SCI studies (Devaraj et al., 2007; Koufteros et al., 2005; Rosenzweig
et al., 2003; Swink et al., 2007). A proﬁle of the respondents is
presented in Tables 1 and 2, indicating that they represent a variety
of

concentration of industries in the cities studied. Most of the
respondents have been in their position for more than three years;
thus, they should be knowledgeable about the information
requested.

To assess potential late response bias, we compared early and
late responses on their physical assets, annual sales and number of
employees (Armstrong and Overton, 1977), with a t-test showing
no signiﬁcant differences. Since there was a single informant per
organization, the potential for common method bias was assessed.
Analysis of Harmon’s single-factor test of common method bias
(Podsakoff and Organ, 1986; Podsakoff et al., 2003; Hochwarter
et al., 2004) revealed nine distinct factors with eigenvalues above
or near 1.0, explaining 72.1% total variance. The ﬁrst factor
explained 33.8% of the variance, which was not the majority of the
total variance. It is acceptable for a study such as this, where the
constructs are correlated, both conceptually and practically. To
further assess common method bias, conﬁrmatory factor analysis
was applied to Harman’s single-factor model (Sanchez and Brock,
1996). The model’s ﬁt indices of x2 (986) = 11690.67, NNFI = 0.85,
CFI = 0.86, RMSEA = 0.18 and SRMR = 0.13 were unacceptable and
were signiﬁcantly worse than those of the measurement model.
This suggests that a single factor is not acceptable, thus the
common method bias is small. As a third test of common method
bias, a measurement model including only the traits and one
including a method factor, in addition to the traits, were tested
(Widaman, 1985; Paulraj et al., 2008; Podsakoff et al., 2003;
Williams et al., 1989). The results of the method factor model
marginally improved model ﬁt (NFI by 0.01, NNFI by 0.01, CFI 0.01),
with the common method factor accounting for 10.2% of the total
variance. The path coefﬁcients of the trait factors and their
signiﬁcance were similar between the two models, suggesting that
they were robust, despite the inclusion of a method factor (Paulraj
et al., 2008). This provides further indication that the common
method bias is not a serious concern.

3.3. Reliability and validity

Each variable’s cumulative proportion was plotted against the
cumulative proportion for several test distributions, revealing that
the data appeared to be approximately normally distributed. The

scales were all reliable, with alpha values ranging from 0.84 to 0.94
(see Table 3). Appendix B reveals that all items had strong loadings
on the construct that they were intended to measure. The EFA
results also indicate that all items have lower loadings on the
constructs that they were not intended to measure. The results
demonstrate construct unidimensionality. Content validity was
established through a domain search of the literature, careful
synthesis and critical evaluation of existing constructs and an
iterative construct review by domain experts.

We ﬁrst used CFA to evaluate convergent validity as suggested
by O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka (1998). Each measurement item was
linked to its corresponding construct, and the covariance among
the constructs was freely estimated. The model ﬁt indices were x2
(976) = 4751.23, NNFI = 0.95, CFI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.090 and
SRMR = 0.070. Thus, the model was acceptable (Hu and Bentler,
1999), indicating convergent validity (O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka,
1998). Furthermore, all factor loadings were greater than 0.50, the
t-values were all greater than 2.0 (Droge et al., 2004; Koufteros
et al., 2007; Narasimhan and Kim, 2002; Vickery et al., 2003), and
each item’s coefﬁcient is greater than twice its standard error
(Anderson and Gerbing, 1988), further demonstrating convergent
validity. The estimates for the average variance extracted (AVE)
were higher than 0.50 for four constructs, and 0.46 for the ﬁfth
construct. While Fornell and Larcker (1981) suggested that the
minimum AVE should be 0.50 and one of our constructs fall slightly
below the minimum of 0.50, we satisﬁed the more detailed criteria
set by several other studies as indicated above. Therefore our
constructs have convergent validity.

In order to assess discriminant validity, we built a constrained
CFA model for every possible pair of latent constructs, in which the
correlations between the paired constructs were ﬁxed to 1.0. This
was compared with the original unconstrained model, in which the
correlations among constructs were freely estimated. The x2
difference demonstrated discriminant validity (Bagozzi et al.,
1991; Chen and Paulraj, 2004b; O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka, 1998).
Furthermore, the average variance extracted (AVE) for each
construct was greater than the squared correlation between that
construct and the other constructs as suggested by Fornell and
Larcker (1981), providing further evidence of discriminant validity.

business performance. The third step assessed the relationship
between two- and three-way interactions of internal, customer
and supplier integration and operational or business performance,
in order to determine whether there was a moderating effect.

The results of the hierarchical regression analysis for opera-
tional and business performance are contained in Tables 4 and 5.
Table 4 indicates that there is a signiﬁcant direct relationship
between internal integration and operational performance, sup-
porting H1a. Adding customer and supplier integration to the
model yielded a signiﬁcant change in R2, indicating that the
addition of customer and supplier
integration contributed
signiﬁcantly to the predictive power of the model. However, only
the coefﬁcient for customer integration was statistically signiﬁ-
cant, indicating that customer integration was directly related to
operational performance, given the relationship between internal
integration and operational performance, while supplier integra-
tion was not. Therefore, the results only partially supported
hypothesis H2a.

Adding the interaction terms further increased the predictive
power of the regression model, which was statistically signiﬁcant.
However, the interactions between customer or supplier integration
and internal integration were not statistically signiﬁcant, while
there was a signiﬁcant interaction between customer and supplier
integration. Therefore, neither customer integration nor supplier
integration moderated the relationship between internal integra-
tion and operational performance, and H3a was not supported.

Table 5 indicates that there is a direct positive relationship
between internal integration and business performance, support-
ing H1b. The addition of customer and supplier integration in step 2
added very little to the predictive power of the model, and the
change in R2 was not signiﬁcant. Similarly, the addition of the
interaction terms in step 3 had very little effect. Thus H2b and H3b
were not supported. Although internal integration was related to
business performance, customer integration, supplier integration
and their interactions were not.

4.2. Conﬁguration analysis of SCI

4.2.1. Emergent taxonomy of SCI

H4 posits that an emergent taxonomy can be developed, based
on the internal, supplier and customer integration of manufac-
turers. Cluster analysis was used to classify the respondents into
SCI patterns. Hierarchical clustering procedures determined the
number of clusters that should be formed, then non-hierarchical
clustering was applied to produce the ﬁnal clusters (Hair et al.,
1998). The percentage of change in the agglomeration coefﬁcient
was highest when the number of groups changed from ﬁve to four,
indicating that ﬁve clusters were sufﬁcient (Fig. 1). A random
sampling of dendrograms conﬁrmed that classiﬁcation using ﬁve
clusters represented the best solution.

In interpreting the results in Table 6 and Fig. 2, we examined SCI
strength and balance. Two of the SCI patterns were stronger in

internal and customer integration than they were in supplier
integration. We labeled these the Medium Customer Leaning and
High Customer Leaning SCI patterns and describe them as
unbalanced SCI patterns. The other three SCI patterns were
balanced, with similar levels of customer, supplier and internal
integration within each pattern. We labeled these the Low
Uniform, Medium Uniform and High Uniform SCI patterns,
reﬂecting their balance between customer, supplier and internal
integration. Canonical discriminant analysis was used to identify
the underlying dimensions which deﬁned the clusters. Table 7
shows that the ﬁrst two functions had eigenvalues larger than 1,
explaining 99.9% of the variance. Table 8 reveals that all three
dimensions of SCI were important in forming Function 1, which
divided the clusters into those with low (Low Uniform), medium
(Medium Customer Leaning and Medium Uniform patterns) and
high SCI (High Customer Leaning and High Uniform patterns).
Thus, Function 1 represents SCI strength, and it was the greatest
differentiator between the patterns.

Function 2 reﬂects SCI balance, indicated by the positive loading
of customer and internal integration and negative loading of
supplier integration. It divides the patterns into those with greater
(High, Medium and Low Uniform patterns) and less (High and
Medium Customer Leaning patterns) SCI balance. Although
statistically signiﬁcant, this difference between the patterns was

weaker than their difference in SCI strength. Fig. 3 indicates that
the clusters were differentiated from each other by the discrimi-
nant functions representing SCI strength and SCI balance. Between
96.3% and 98.7% of the respondents were correctly classiﬁed,
indicating very high predictive ability. Thus, these patterns of SCI
are independent and are not prone to misclassiﬁcation. We
conclude that manufacturers can be clustered into groups with
differing levels of SCI strength and balance, based on customer,
supplier and internal integration, supporting H4.

4.2.2. Relationship between SCI patterns and performance

Analysis of variance was used to test the relationship between
SCI patterns and performance. Table 9 indicates that there were
statistically signiﬁcant differences in operational performance
between the SCI patterns, supporting H5a. Scheffe post hoc analysis
was used to determine differences between speciﬁc patterns. The
High Uniform pattern had the best operational performance,
followed by the High Customer Leaning pattern. This indicates that
SCI strength was more strongly related to operational performance
than SCI balance.
Interestingly, there was not a signiﬁcant
difference in operational performance between the High Uniform
and High Customer Leaning patterns of SCI. Similarly, there was
not a signiﬁcant difference in operational performance among the
Medium Uniform, Low Uniform, and Medium Customer Leaning
patterns of SCI.

Table 9 also shows the relationship between SCI pattern and
business performance, revealing that the High Uniform and High

5. Discussion

We found that most of our hypotheses were supported or
partially supported, broadly indicating that SCI
is related to
performance. Speciﬁcally, by applying the contingency approach,
we found that internal integration was directly related to both
business and operational performance and that customer integra-
tion was directly related to operational performance. Although
supplier integration was not directly related to either type of
performance, the interaction of supplier and customer integration
was related to operational performance.

internal

When we compare our results with those from previous
research on SCI, our ﬁnding that
integration was
signiﬁcantly related to operational and business performance is
consistent with several studies (Droge et al., 2004; Stank et al.,
2001a,b; Germain and Iyer, 2006). Thus, our research reinforces the
importance of internal integration in improving performance. This
is an important ﬁnding, since much of the extant literature on SCI
does not include internal integration as a dimension of SCI. Our
ﬁnding that customer integration was signiﬁcantly related to
operational performance is consistent with the ﬁndings of several
previous studies (Germain and Iyer, 2006; Koufteros et al., 2005).
However, Devaraj et al. (2007) found that customer integration did
not have a signiﬁcant direct effect on operational performance, but
only moderated the effect of supplier integration on operational

Table 9
Analysis of variance.

performance. Our ﬁnding that supplier integration is not directly
related to operational performance is supported by Stank et al.
(2001a). In general, the literature on the relationship of supplier
integration with performance has very mixed ﬁndings. While some
studies (Koufteros et al., 2005; Swink et al., 2007) found that
supplier integration was negatively related to certain aspects of
operational performance, Devaraj et al. (2007) found a positive
relationship between supplier integration and operational perfor-
mance.

The comparison of our research ﬁndings with those of previous
studies indicates that examination of the effect of the individual
dimensions of SCI on performance was not sufﬁcient. The
relationship of SCI to performance can only be fully examined
when all three dimensions of SCI are considered together. Studies
which consider only one or two dimensions of SCI often lead to
confusing results. For example, our analysis showed that supplier
integration, in isolation, was signiﬁcantly related to operational
and business performance, however, this analysis did not consider
internal integration. The relationship between supplier integration
and operational and business performance became insigniﬁcant
when internal integration was added to the model. Furthermore,
supplier and customer integration often have different relation-
ships to performance. Therefore, studies that aggregate supplier
and customer integration in a single construct (external integra-
tion) may be drawing inaccurate conclusions.

Our ﬁndings indicate that supplier integration is important to
performance, but in a different way than internal and customer
integration are. While customer integration was signiﬁcantly related
to operational performance both directly and through its interaction
with supplier integration, supplier integration was only signiﬁcant as
part of the interaction term. Since the objective of SCI is to provide
maximum value to the customer, the measurement of operational
performance is necessarily customer-oriented. Supplier integration
may not contribute to operational performance directly, but instead
interacts with customer integration in improving operational
performance, reﬂecting the importance of manufacturers’ integra-
tion with both downstream and upstream supply chain partners. Our
study also indicates that, while internal integration was positively
related to business performance, supplier and customer integration
were not directly related to business performance. This may be
because customer and supplier integration are related to business
performance through operational performance.

Overall,

the contingency approach reveals that

internal
integration forms the foundation upon which customer and
supplier integration build. This suggests that companies should
begin SCI with internal integration, laying the foundation for
customer and supplier integration. This is a particularly important
ﬁnding, since much of the prior research has failed to include
internal integration, instead focusing only on customer and/or
supplier integration. This suggests that the best approach to SCI is
to start by developing internal integration capabilities and then to
build external customer and supplier integration capabilities.

The conﬁguration approach showed that the overall SCI
construct was related to both operational and business perfor-
mance. Because supply chain strength was more strongly related to
performance than supply chain balance, the best performance was

achieved by manufacturers which were strong across the board in
internal, customer and supplier integration. However, because the
High Customer Leaning pattern was indistinguishable from the
High Uniform Pattern, in terms of its relationship to performance,
this means that both patterns have a similar effect. Thus, if a
manufacturer has limited resources or is early in its SCI efforts, it
can start by establishing a foundation of internal integration, then
follow on by developing strong customer integration. The ﬁnding
that the emergent SCI patterns are related to different levels of
performance provides signiﬁcant implications for companies to
pursue the better performance through better SCI conﬁguration
(Das et al., 2006; Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001).

It is interesting to compare the results of our taxonomy, which
included internal
integration as a taxon, with Frohlich and
Westbrook’s (2001) taxonomy, which did not include internal
integration. Our High Uniform pattern is similar to their Outward-
Facing pattern, which included the upper quartile of both customer
and supplier integration, and our High Customer Leaning pattern is
similar to Frohlich and Westbrook’s (2001) Customer-Facing pattern.
Our Medium Uniform pattern is similar to their Periphery-Facing
pattern, which includes the medium quartiles of customer and
supplier integration, and our Low Uniform pattern is similar to their
Inward-Facing pattern. Only our Medium Customer Leaning pattern
did not correspond to any pattern in Frohlich and Westbrook’s (2001)
taxonomy. Similarly, we found that a pattern corresponding to
Frohlich and Westbrook’s (2001) Supplier-Facing pattern did not
emerge in our taxonomy. However, our ﬁndings about the relation-
ship between SCI patterns and performance generally support those
of Frohlich and Westbrook (2001).

insight

The conﬁguration approach also reveals that the effect of SCI is
cumulative, providing signiﬁcant
for companies in
implementing it. Improvements in SCI will not lead to improved
operational performance, when the level of SCI is relatively low
(from Low Uniform to Medium Customer Leaning or Medium
Uniform). However, once a threshold level of SCI has been
achieved, further improvements in SCI, even small improvements,
will be associated with signiﬁcantly improved operational
performance.

The ﬁndings from the contingency approach and those from the
conﬁguration approach are complementary. On one hand, the
contingency approach found that internal and customer integra-
tion are the differentiators of performance and that supplier
integration is not directly related to performance. The non-
signiﬁcant difference between the performance of the High
Uniform pattern and that of the High Customer Leaning pattern
in the conﬁguration approach echoes this contingent ﬁnding. On
the other hand, the contingency approach found that each
dimension of SCI and the interactions between them are related
to performance, which was overlooked by the conﬁguration
approach. However,
the conﬁguration approach found that
companies’ SCI pattern is related to performance and SCI capability
is cumulative in improving performance, which was not revealed
by the contingency approach. Thus, it is important that research on
SCI continue to apply both a contingency and a conﬁguration
approach to tease out all important relationships.

6. Conclusions and limitations

This study extends the existing research on SCI in several
important ways. First, it adds to the literature by empirically
testing the relationship between SCI and performance. In including
both internal and external integration and their interactions, and
incorporating both operational and business performance, this
study adds greater comprehensiveness and richness to the SCI
literature and enhances our understanding of the impact of SCI on
performance.

Second, this research describes SCI

in three dimensions:
internal, customer and supplier integration, ﬁnding that internal
integration forms the foundation upon which customer and
supplier integration build. It further develops a taxonomy of SCI
based on internal, customer and supplier integration. Although
Frohlich and Westbrook’s (2001) taxonomy identiﬁed ﬁve SCI
patterns based on customer and supplier integration, internal
integration was not included in their dimensions. Similarly,
Devaraj et al. (2007) considered only supplier and customer
integration, but did not include internal integration. Droge et al.
(2004) considered internal and external integration, but did not
break down external
integration into customer and supplier
integration, as we did. Our ﬁndings provide preliminary evidence
of the importance of including internal integration in developing
SCI patterns, as well as establishing a direct relationship between
internal integration and performance. Internal integration pro-
vides a vital link between customer integration and supplier
integration, without which companies are unable to reap the full
beneﬁts of their SCI efforts.

Our ﬁndings extend the SCI

literature by indicating the
importance of SCI practices across industries in China. Previous
related research has focused on other contexts, for example, the
North American automotive industry (Droge et al., 2004; Devaraj
et al., 2007). China has become a global manufacturing center and
an attractive target for outsourcing by Western ﬁrms. Effective SCI
can help make Chinese companies even more attractive supply
chain partners through reduction of transaction costs. Chinese
manufacturers can improve their business performance through
enhancing integration of their own internal processes and with
their customers and suppliers.

While our study makes a signiﬁcant contribution to the SCI
literature and has important implications for practice, there are
some limitations and opportunities for future studies. First, this
study uses a cross-sectional design. Because integration
between customers, suppliers and manufacturers is developed
over time, it will be fruitful for future research to examine the
evolution of SCI patterns in a longitudinal fashion. Second,
because the data were only collected from manufacturers, future
studies can broaden their scope by collecting data from all
supply chain partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and
customers. Third, although this research provided some inter-
esting ﬁndings about
the relationship between SCI and
performance in China, it is not clear whether these relationships
will be the same in other countries. Future research should
examine cross-cultural differences in the relationship between
SCI and performance. In particular, studies which compare SCI in
developed versus developing economies will be of interest.
Finally, by focusing on various industries, company sizes and
regions, we developed a broad picture of the relationship
between SCI pattern and performance. However, these relation-
ships may not be the same for all company sizes, industries or
regions. Future research should examine the impact of these
contextual factors on SCI patterns and their relationship with
performance.

Another interesting area of research is the factors that
supplier and internal
inﬂuence the degree of customer,
integration in the SCI patterns. These factors may include
factors such as the competitive environment, relationship
commitment, trust, organizational characteristics and national
culture. Likewise, the relationship between SCI and competitive
performance is another potentially interesting area for future
study. For example, Bowersox et al.’s (1999) work on the
importance of SCI as a differentiator of overall performance,
compared with other differentiating factors, could be extended
to incorporate our taxonomy of SCI. In a similar vein, this
taxonomy could be used to build on Swink et al.’s (2007) work to


68

determine whether different patterns of SCI have differing
impacts on competitive capabilities and performance.

SCI is an increasingly important area of research, as supply
chains become more widely dispersed across the globe. This
research addresses some fundamental issues in SCI, as well as
raising a number of critical research questions that remain to be
resolved.
