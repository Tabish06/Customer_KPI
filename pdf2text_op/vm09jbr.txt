The academic research on branding of consumer products and services is increasingly considering the degree of
connectedness between consumers and brands as a key issue of investigation. The literature in this area
investigates the nature and the strength of the relationship that consumers develop with brands, as well as the
trend of joining brand tribes or brand communities in order to demonstrate and share with others their feelings
towards and preference to brands. However, the impact of the overall perceptions of the brands in the form of
its reputation and brand tribalism on brand relationships is so far unexplored in the existing literature. Using
data collected from 912 respondents, this paper explores the importance of the long term brand reputation and
brand tribalism on the strength of brand relationships. The ﬁndings suggest that brand tribalism is a better
predictor of the strength of brand relationships than the long term brand reputation itself.

1. Introduction

It is appreciated that the relational approach is a feasible strategy
in mass consumer markets (Sheth and Parvatiyar, 1995; Christy et al.,
1996; O'Malley and Tynan, 1999, 2000), that the marketing mix could
be the base for relationship development with consumers (Coviello
and Brondie, 1998; Coviello et al., 2002; Lye, 2002) and that mental
images, “symbols and objects”, can be one of the many aspects that
can be used as a basis of a relationship (Gummesson, 1994).
Individuals may develop relationships with speciﬁc brands and to
reduce their choice set is possible (Sheth and Parvatiyar, 1995) and
consumers’ bonds with speciﬁc brands and services seem to be
somewhat similar in nature (Johnston and Thomson, 2003).

Consumers may form relationships with brands on the basis of
several characteristics of these brands and their perceptions and
behavior towards them. Having lost all faith in unity and totality of
achievement, postmodernism has reinforced the importance of living
and enjoying the fragmented moments of consumers’ life experiences
(Firat and Schultz, 1997). Consumers no longer consume products for
their utility, but because of their symbolic meaning, which represents
images. Postmodern researchers believe that image is not a priority
but a selling entity which the product tries to represent. The image
does not represent the product; it’s the product that represents the
image (Cova, 1999) and each consumer becomes an “illusion
consumer” that buys images not products (Elliot, 1999). However,

the existing research does not analyze the respective power of the
views consumers have on brands through their reputation and the
social inﬂuence they experience in terms of brand tribes when they
are forming relationships with brands.

Most research analyzing brand communities at present focuses on
luxury brands and/or products that consumers are highly involved with,
such as cars, motorbikes, jeeps, computers or personal digital assistants
(i.e. Muninz and O'Guinn, 2001; McAlexander et al., 2002; Algesheimer
et al., 2005; Muniz and Schau, 2005; Schouten and McAlexander, 2005),
and there is a very limited attempt to analyze products that target the
mass market, such as chocolate spread (i.e. Cova and Pace, 2006). Most
published research focuses on consumers who recognize their connec-
tion with a group of consumers who are also interested in a brand and
are members of the brand community. The purpose of this research is to
investigate the relative inﬂuence of the brand reputation and the
signiﬁcant others in the formation of strong consumer–brand relation-
ships, for a fast moving consumer goods product; soft drinks. The paper,
ﬁrst discusses the concept of brand reputation and the potential
contribution of brands in the development of relationships. It then
focuses on brand communities or tribes and their increasing role in the
formulation of brand reputation, proposes the research questions and
outlines the data collection methods. Finally,
it offers discussion,
conclusion and suggestions for managers and academia.

2. Brand reputation

Both academics and practitioners believe that brand reputation is
becoming increasingly important. To be successful and hence proﬁtable,
brands should have a positive reputation (Herbig and Milewicz, 1995).

The reputation is the aggregate perception of outsiders on the salient
characteristics of companies (Fombrun and Rindova, 2000), or brands.
The development of brand reputation means more than keeping
consumers satisﬁed, it is something a company earns over time and
refers to how various audiences evaluate the brand. Companies and
brands with a good reputation are likely to attract more customers and a
brand will
lose its positive reputation—and eventually develop a
negative reputation—if it repeatedly fails to fulﬁll its stated intentions
or marketing signals (Milewicz and Herbig, 1994).

The various audiences recognize brands as independent market
organisms. Consumers perceive them as characters, while both
managers and the environment sustain them (Jevons et al., 2005) and
consumers can perceive brands as characters. For example, research
indicates that consumers can think of brands as if they are celebrities
(Rook,1985), or as if they have a character of their own (Blackston, 1992,
1993). Brand reputation occurs primary through the signals that
producers send to the market and the degree that the organizational
tactics support the marketing signals establish it (Herbig and Milewicz,
1995). In this respect, it is an output of the brand identity that the
company proposes, the promises the company makes and the extent
that consumers experience the offer that the company promises. The
management of the brand reputation is continual. The brand’s concept
and the brand image, and as a consequence its reputation will be
managed over the brand’s life, via the selection of a brand expression, its
introduction in the market and its further expansion, defense and
enforcement over time (Park et al., 1986).

Reputation is one of the primary contributors to perceived quality of
the products carrying the brand name. Consumers expect that products
manufactured today have a similar quality as products manufactured in
the past, since the brand is adding credibility (Milewicz and Herbig,
1994). Individuals form positive views only for the brands they perceive
credible. They assess the incomplete brand information collected over
time and companies in order to secure the development of a sound
reputation, have to try to project consistent messages.

It is not easy to drastically alter a brand's reputation over a short
period of time. People tend to classify brands in categories and have a
speciﬁc opinion on these categories. In addition, there is always a time
lag effect (Shapiro, 1983), which is expected to inﬂuence the future
opinion that consumers form on the brand. The brand's current
reputation will inﬂuence the prediction for its actions. Customers
anticipate a brand will meet their expectations, formed by its existing
reputation. In this respect, the market expects consistency from the
brand, both in terms of its projected identity and the support of this
identity. Mixed signaling (saying one thing and doing another)
damages reputation. Customers will not perceive a brand as reliable
and credible when it does not deliver what it promises (Herbig and
Milewicz, 1995).

3. Brand relationships

The early academic relationship marketing literature did not clearly
recognize the role of brands as relationship builders, since it was arguing
that brands are primarily transaction facilitators (Grönroos, 1996;
Coviello and Brondie, 2001; Coviello et al., 2002). The literature at the
time was suggesting that producers have to decide on the emphasis
given to the brand element and the relationship element when
positioning their offerings, choosing from a continuum of low-high
emphasis for both elements (Palmer, 1996). However, popular press was
the ﬁrst to acknowledge the view that consumers develop relationships
with brands and latter the dominant view in the academic literature
accepted it. The researchers recognize that the brand relationship is
some sort of bond (ﬁnancial, physical or emotional) that brings the
brand seller and buyer together (Schultz and Schultz, 2004) and that
brands are entities having their own personality, which the customer
can relate to (i.e. Blackston,1992,1993; Fournier and Yao,1997; Fournier,
1998; Blackston, 2000; Pawle and Cooper, 2006). Buyers also develop

relationships with the product, the object (Saren and Tzokas, 1998; Lye,
2002) or with the service (Dall'Olmo Riley and de Chernatony, 2000) and
their knowledge and feelings about the brand,
inﬂuences their
evaluation of the products carrying this brand (Aaker and Keller, 1990;
Dacin and Smith,1994; Brawn and Dacin,1997). Other product or service
attributes can make the brand–consumer relationship stronger or
weaker, as—for example—the music played in a certain retail outlet
(Beverland et al., 2006).

It is now acknowledged that consumers create bonds with speciﬁc
brands, objects or ﬁrms (Daskou and Hart, 2002; Thomson et al., 2005)
to the extent that even store loyal consumers tend to switch stores as
much as the non-store loyal (opportunist) consumers when they
cannot ﬁnd the product brand they require (Verbeke et al., 1998).
Companies have realized the potential of relationships with con-
sumers and often develop relevant customer relationship strategies in
an attempt to develop an actively linked consumer base (Rowley and
Haynes, 2005).

Relationship marketing in the consumer product context consists
of the management of a network of relationships between a brand and
its customers (Ambler, 1997). Although some consumers might be
unwilling to accept that they form a relationship with brands when it
is described in these terms (Bengtsson, 2003), the literature suggests
that a brand can be treated as “an active contributing partner in a
dyadic relationship that exists between the person and the brand”
(Fournier, 1995). Recent research ﬁndings support that the positive
brand and personal interaction are central to the building of successful
brand relationships (O'Loughlin et al., 2004). For the brand to
transform to a legitimate relationship partner, it has to surpass the
personiﬁcation qualiﬁcation stage and behave as an active contribut-
ing member of the dyad (Fournier, 1998; Berry, 2000). It is important
for consumers to feel that brands have positive behavior and attitudes
towards them (Blackston, 1992, 1993). People want to deal with
companies they see as innovative, ambitious, ingenious and hard-
working (Blackston, 1993) and they expect emotional beneﬁts from
the brands they are purchasing (Pawle and Cooper, 2006). Research
suggests that the perceived personality of brands can inﬂuence the
strength of the relationship consumers form with these brands over
time (Aaker et al., 2004). It is also been proven that when consumers
feel a brand has the desired attitude towards the issues they perceive
as important to their system of values, they tend to support and buy it
(Kates, 2000).

According to the literature, such relationships exist in various
contexts. It is evident, especially in well-deﬁned groups of consumers
and sub-cultures. For example, gay men develop speciﬁc relationships
with their brands. They identify with some local retail businesses
(community members), they have positive emotions and reciprocity
towards some brands (political allies), while they have a negative
relationship with other brands (political enemies) (Kates, 2000). It has
also been suggested that even children develop relationships with
brands and the connections with brands are developing strong links
between middle childhood and early adolescence (Chaplin and John,
2005) and that childhood memories inﬂuence the manner in which
they relate to brands for life (Braun-La Tour et al., 2007).

The brand–consumer relationship might take a number of forms,
depending on the personality of consumers and the manner in which
these individuals develop relationships (Fournier, 1998). They describe
them as being in a point in a continuum, having as extremes the lower-
order relationships and in the other the higher-order (loyal) relation-
ships. Researchers identify ﬁve potential stages in the friendship, from
potential friends (brand trying), casual friends (brand liking), close
friends (multi-brand resurgent loyalty), best friends (brand loyalty) and
crucial friends (brand addiction) (Fajer and Schouten, 1995). A more
detailed study of the consumer’s perspective identiﬁes at least ﬁfteen
forms of relationship and their labels vary from an arranged marriage,
many types of friendships to enslavement, resulting in relationships
with different qualities (Fournier, 1998; Sweeney and Chew, 2002). The


316

association can be voluntary versus imposed, long term versus short
term, public versus private, formal versus informal and symmetric
versus asymmetric forming different types of relationships (Fournier,
1998). It can grow to a level where consumers may form a passionate
emotional attachment to brands, that some characterize brand love
(Carroll and Ahuvia, 2006). Brands are lovemarks that consumers are;
committed to, feel empathy and passion for as they love and respect
them (Pawle and Cooper, 2006). As in every relationship, the relation-
ship with brands can reach an end and its termination and the
dissolution of the person–brand relationship is examined (Fajer and
Schouten, 1995).

Customers may form attachments with more than one brand in the
same category (Fournier and Yao, 1997), as long as they are familiar with
them. As in the case for human relationships, bonds exist only with known
brands. Forward looking marketers and research agencies acknowledge
the importance of this approach and incorporate relationship based ideas
such as trust and bonds with brand management (Esch et al., 2006).

4. Brands and tribal behavior

Clearly, there is an interrelationship between brands and consumers
(Jevons et al., 2005). Symbols and signs are constantly changing in a
bricolage-manner to ﬁt each speciﬁc situation. Thus,
in a sense,
consumption becomes production (Christensen et al., 2005). Any
admirer that has a relationship with other admirers of a speciﬁc brand
is a member of a brand community. There are brand communities that
are very formal and structured and others that are informal and loose,
brand tribes. In certain occasions brand communities may take greater
control over the association that characterizes the brand rather than the
brand team (Muninz and O'Guinn, 2001), to the extent that some discuss
brand hijack (Wathieu et al., 2002; Cova and Pace, 2006). For example,
when loyal consumers of Crown Pilot crackers discovered that Nabisco
had ceased production of their beloved product, citizen lobbying began
to pressure the corporation to reverse its decision. This consumer
grassroots campaign is an embodiment of a “new social movement”.
While the passion of campaign organizers and consumers for the cracker
was of paramount importance, the analysis also shed light on a complex
interplay of factors that coalesced, saving this product from extinction
(Hart et al., 2001). Consumers supporting the Apple Newton when it was
discontinued (Muniz and Schau, 2005), as well as “Classic Coke” when
Coca Cola attempted to introduce the New Coke in 1985 (Harley, 1998),
to the extent that companies were forced to bring discontinued products
back on the market, are other examples of the same behavior. The use of
new communication technologies has helped create, sustain and
enhance the lobby efforts.

The recent academic literature theorizes consumer agency (Kozinets
et al., 2004) discuss how consumers and producers negotiate consump-
tion, when the exchange mutually serves their respective interests.
Powerful agents determine who takes access and has considerable
inﬂuence over what constitutes effective co-production. These are
critical social spaces in which consumer tribes play an important role.
Consumer desire is a passion, born within the consumption process.
Consumers may develop imagination of and cravings for consumer
goods and services not yet launched on the market. Some of these
products may seem to promise a magical measuring of life. Belk et al.,
(2003) analyze the “Fire of Desire” through a multisited inquiry into
consumer passion. The consumption and emotion in the light of new
intersections with sociological
issues of embodiment and study's
emotions (Boden and Williams, 2002). A variety of themes and issues
are raised: the persistence of mind/body, reason/emotion dualities in the
consumption literature, the importance of ‘disappointment’ in con-
sumer culture, external factors which mediate the consumption
experience, and ﬁnally the interpretation of both Romanticism and
romantic, interpersonal relationships. It analyzes a largely disembodied
and socially disembedded account of consumption and emotion. In
making these claims, they highlight the need for a ‘passionate’ sociology,

which would in turn integrate embodiment and emotions more fully
into the consumption agenda.

Speculation about the linkages between consumer products, con-
sumption-related attitudes, and subjective well-being is prominent in the
social sciences. Oropesa (1995) examines whether the accumulation and
anticipated accumulation of different types of consumer goods foster
subjective well-being, whether accumulation and anticipated accumula-
tion explained the well-established relationship between income and
subjective well-being and whether passions for the new were positively
or negatively related to subjective well-being. Although some results
indicate that the heavy theoretical emphasis on the importance of
consumer markets for subjective well-being and the income–subjective
well-being relationship was overdrawn, others provided weak support for
a market-centric perspective that emphasizes the positive consequences
of accumulating different types of consumer goods. Different types of
consumer goods ﬁll different niches in individuals’ lives as they age. Lastly,
the passion for new experiences in the marketplace and subjective well-
being have a positive link.

It is in the context of a postmodern society—and by opposition to
modern theories which conceived the society as joint social and
professional groups, categories and classes—emerges a network of
societal micro-groups (tribes) in which individuals share strong
emotional links, a common sub-culture and a vision of life. The impulse
to join others is universal and natural because we want to belong (McGee-
Cooper, 2005). The word “tribe” refers to the re-emergence of quasi-
archaic values: a local sense of identiﬁcation, religiousness, syncretism,
group narcissism (Cova, 1997). Postmodern communities are inherently
unstable, small-scale, and not ﬁxed by any of the established parameters
of modern society (Maffesoli, 1996). In contrast to a market segment, a
tribe is a network of heterogeneous persons, in terms of gender, age, sex
and income, who have a link because of a shared passion or emotion. Its
members are not just consumers but also advocates. From a modernist
mechanist perspective, neo-tribes no longer ﬁt into predeﬁned cate-
gories, which makes their behavior predictable (Cova, 1997). Tribes differ
from psychographic segments in their short life span and diversity,
diverging from reference groups because they do not focus on the
normative inﬂuences of the group nor do individual group members
focus on each other (Cova and Cova, 2002). Although conveying the same
characteristics as an “ethnic group”, tribes are of a smaller scale; however,
still greater than that of a clan.

Postmodern consumers use products and brands for their own
purposes as well as a medium to help them deﬁne themselves and
express their identities within society (Lannon, 1995). They develop
relationships between themselves, the brand, the ﬁrm, other consumers
and the product in use (McAlexander et al., 2002). They seek satisfaction
through emotions shared with others, through being with them, not
through consuming with them (Cova, 1997). The groups of consumers
created around one brand are the brand tribes or brand communities
(Cova and Pace, 2006) but some others seem to call them sub-cultures of
consumption (Fournier, 1998; Fournier and Yao, 1997; Schouten and
McAlexander, 2005). The difference between the meaning of these
terms as used in the literature is not is not always clear.

A brand community is a community of individuals formed on the
bases of emotional attachment to a product or a brand (Muninz and
O'Guinn, 1995, 2001). There is a strong connection between brand,
individual identity and culture. Therefore, and more precisely, a brand
community is as an enduring, self selected group of consumers, sharing
a system of values, standards and representations, who accept and
recognize bonds of membership with each other and with the whole.
The members of the community have some degree of awareness that
they belong to the group and a sense of obligation towards to the brand
community (Muninz and O'Guinn, 2001) and they inﬂuence each other
(Algesheimer et al., 2005). Some suggest that sub-cultural groups
based on ethnic origin can form brand communities (Quinn and
Devasagayam, 2005). Brand communities are forming not only in the
on line environment or for luxury brands but for all types of brand,


C. Veloutsou, L. Moutinho / Journal of Business Research 62 (2009) 314–322

317

even for fast moving consumer good products (Cova and Pace, 2006).
Because of the power brand communities have over the brand,
managers often try to create brand communities or to inﬂuence their
members (Cova and Cova, 2002).

Today consumers base their choices more on symbolic attributes.
The degree of trust the consumers feel towards the brand, rather than
assessment of its features and beneﬁts, will determine which brand
they will select. Tribalism can also be focused on “making and living
together” applied in a collaborative and participatory sense. We are
witnessing an attempt to refuge the symbiosis of communities and
commerce (Cova and Cova, 2001). Tribal brands evolve around
products with similar values. They are the emotional result of
personalization. The process of creating a tribal brand incorporates
thousands of social interactions amongst customers with various
facets of their preferred brand, taking an extended link of time to
attain a socialized expression that constitutes a tribal brand
(Moutinho et al., 2007). To succeed in the era of trust networks,
consumers have to think differently about brand-voice expression. A
tribal brand is a consequence of socialized expressions.

Individuals can belong to more than one neo-tribe. During their
existence tribes convey signs, visible and invisible, with which
members identify: moments and locals where members come
together for cult rituals that are part of that collective imagery. In a
tribe totally devoted to its passion, members are ready to sacriﬁce
time and money (Badot and Cova, 2003).

5. Hypotheses development

The brand image plays a key role in the development of brand
relationships (Esch et al., 2006). When the new active, knowledgeable
and demanding consumer is analyzed, it has been proven that the
product/service perceptions could inﬂuence the consumer relation-
ship quality (Stuart-Menteth et al., 2006) The two constructs have
been examined together in other studies, but their direct relationship
has not always been investigated (i.e. Veloutsou, 2006). However,
researchers recognize that consumers tend to be more loyal to brands
they have a good attitude towards. Brand reputation seems to be one
of the antecedents of brand loyalty (Chaudhuri, 1999; Gounaris and
Stathakopoulos, 2004). Given these related ﬁndings and the lack of
research in this area, the hypothesis is that:

H1. The more positive the brand reputation, the stronger the relationship
with the Brand.

Consumers share stories about brands, as powerful word-of-mouth
communications from inﬂuential or inspirational consumers passing
virally around communities (Pawle and Cooper, 2006). Even early
research suggests that other members of the social network they belong
to inﬂuences individuals. For example, an exploratory study on, if and
how informal social groups inﬂuence the brand preferences of their
members (Stafford, 1966) suggests that such groups and the informal
leader, rather than to the cohesiveness of the group,
inﬂuence
consumers. The way reference groups may inﬂuence other consumers
is not independent from to the proﬁle of the individuals, such as
housewives and students (Park et al., 1977). Other studies further
supported these ﬁndings (i.e. Bearden and Etzel, 1982; Childers and Rao,
1992). For example, in an examination of differences in perceptions of
reference group inﬂuence on 16 product and brand decisions, differences
in reference group inﬂuence between publicly and privately consumed
products and luxuries and necessities are evident (Bearden and Etzel,
1982). In a replication of this study in the US and Thailand, and after
introducing the inﬂuence of the family and inter-generational inﬂuences
across the two cultures, there is more evidence that differences exist is
produced (Childers and Rao, 1992). Research also suggests that the
preferences for Japanese-made cars are related to networks deﬁned
geographically and demographically (Yang and Allenby, 2003).

Recent somewhat more related research suggests that brand
relationships may be the result of imagination or actual participation
in brand communities (Fournier, 1998; Fournier and Yao, 1997) and that
brands and their associated meanings emerge from the interactions
brands have in consumers lives (Braun-La Tour et al., 2007). The degree
to which a brand communicates reference group identity may inﬂuence
the relationships individuals develop with this brand (Swaminathan
et al., 2007). Consumers report higher brand connections for brands
with images that are consistent with the image of ingroup and vice versa
(Escalas and Bettman, 2005). However, past research does not
investigate the effect of brand tribalism on the strength of the
relationship. Therefore the hypothesis is:

H2. The stronger the Brand Tribalism the stronger the Brand Relationship.

Fig. 1 illustrates the research model.

6. Methodology

The drafted questionnaire containing the developed statements
was pilot tested with a convenience sample of twenty individuals, a
mix of undergraduate and part-time MBA students in Scotland. The
developed ﬁnal instrument uses 5 point Likert type scales. More
speciﬁcally, the ﬁnal measures are as follows (see Appendix):

• Long Term Brand Reputation. This study uses two constructs to
measure the Long Term Brand Reputation. The ﬁrst was Brand
Reputation and consisted of 3 items and the second Sustainable
Image and consisted of 2 items.

• Brand Tribalism. There is very little, if any, research attempting to
measure the strength of brand tribalism. Different studies are
measuring the construct of tribal brands in different ways. Cova and
Cova (2001) emphasize linking value, social
interaction of the
communal type and the relationships between tribal rites and
capitalization of an offer at a brand image level. Other researchers,
such as Moutinho et al. (2007), use a factor structure, such as brand
liking, sponsor favorability, perception of fairness in sponsorship,
positive convergence in sponsorship, external manifestations and
accepted sponsorship. In this particular study, the features and traits
that the literature suggests that describe the construct are those
used to measure it. Several articles focusing on the brand tribes and
tribal behavior were content analyzed. Two dimensions (research
sub-constructs) are used, which comply with limited research
standards of other existing studies (Reference group acceptance and
Social visibility of brand with 5 and 3 items respectively). Three
other dimensions were incorporated in the measurability of tribal
brands. These are the Degree of ﬁt with the individual consumer life
style, the contribution that the brand makes to the emotional life of
the consumer (Passion in Life) and another indirect measure of
group bonding, Collective Memory, with 4, 2 and 2 items respectively.
• Brand Relationship. Recently, some researchers attempted to mea-
sure brand relationships. The dimensions of the construct are under
debate in the literature. Some suggest that brand relationships
consist of brand satisfaction, brand trust and brand attachment

(Esch et al., 2006), while others from commitment, immediacy,
satisfaction and self-commitment (Aaker et al., 2004), or an adapted
instrument consisting only from commitment, immediacy and self-
commitment (Gaus et al., 2006). Some even attempt to measure
brand relationships through the investigation of brand love (Carroll
and Ahuvia, 2006). Brand attachment is the long lasting bond
between the brand and the consumer and it can be clearly
distinguished from other concepts, such as brand attitudes,
satisfaction and involvement (Thomson et al., 2005). The emotional
dimension of the bond,
including the self-connection and the
immediacy, undoubtedly is a part of the relationship. However,
issues such as satisfaction from, trust towards and commitment to
the brand are constructs that research examined extensively in the
past. It is questionable if they are components of the relationship.
Some researchers, who excluded satisfaction from a previous
instrument when attempting to measure the strength of brand
relationships, seem to agree with this view (Gaus et al., 2006). All
these constructs are either antecedents to, or the outcomes of the
relationship. In most of the studies examining the strength of the
relationship the dimension of communication is not integrated.
However, if the approach is drawing from the paradigm of human
relationships, then what is deﬁned by social psychology as
components of the relationship should be considered. Social
psychology suggests that communication is an important element
of the relationship (Hinde, 1979, 1981; Falk and Noonan-Warker,
1985; Hinde, 1995, 1997). Therefore, to measure the strength of the
relationship this study uses two dimensions introduced by Veloutsou
(2007). The ﬁrst dimension is the Two-way communications and has 6
items, while the second Emotional exchange has 7 items.

In the beginning of the ﬁnal instrument, respondents had to opt for
Coca Cola or Pepsi and then answered all questions having in mind the
chosen brand. These brands were the most frequently mentioned
brands during the pre-test of the instrument.

The primary data collection, took place over a period of three
months in Glasgow, Scotland. During the ﬁrst two months, the research
instrument was developed and pre-tested, while in the ﬁnal month the
quantitative data was collected, through a self-administrated survey.
Student volunteers acted as ﬁeld researchers to collect the data. They
were asked to recruit non-student respondents, who would complete
the questionnaire independently. This process produced completed
questionnaires from 912 consumers. Given the nature of the product,
there is a good mix of men and women and a reasonable representation
of different age groups. The matching of the sampling descriptors in
terms of age and gender with the population parameters reﬂects with a

parent population is somewhat less effective in terms of the age
brackets due to two main factors. The trained interviewers were
relatively young and therefore more inclined to relate to rather young
respondents,
in particular because of the nature of the non-
probabilistic sampling procedure. Furthermore, the nature and subject
of investigation was more prone to be readily accepted by younger
people selected for the study, because the respondents chose either
cars or soft drinks when completing the survey (Table 1).

Prior to executing any statistical tests, certain computations were
performed and the data was prepared for the rest of the analysis. All
the variables of the study were essentially perceptual and therefore
subject to a respondent's ﬁltering process. Thus, Cronbach's Alpha was
used to test for internal consistency. The average value reported for
each of the variables was calculated and used for the various tests.

In addition to the descriptive statistics, this study employs other
statistical techniques. Due to the exploratory nature of this research, this
study uses stepwise linear regression analysis to identify the variables
predicting the dependent variables and calculates the variance inﬂation
factor (VIF) to control the variables of multi-collinearity.

7. Results

All the constructs of this study had Cronbach's Alpha reliability
coefﬁcients in excess of .70, or Pearson Correlations in excess of .37
(Table 2). They are internally consistent and indeed measure the same
construct. To examine the interrelationships in the model, the average
value of the items describing each one of the constructs under
investigation is used.

For most of the constructs under investigation, the correlation was
signiﬁcant in a .01 level (Table 3). All correlations are positive, as
expected. The two constructs that are components of the Long Term
Reputation have a signiﬁcant correlation. All the constructs that describe
the Brand Tribalism are signiﬁcant correlation, with the Passion in Life

having the strongest link with the remaining constructs. More
speciﬁcally, the Passion in Life has the strongest relationship with the
Degree of ﬁt with lifestyle, while its correlation with the Collective
Memory and the Social Visibility of the Brand are also of interest. The
two dimensions of Brand relationships, although they are also highly
inter-correlated, although a principal component analysis with varimax
rotation clearly separates them. The correlation of the two dimensions of
Brand Relationship with most of the other variables is signiﬁcant and
between .19 and .47, with the exception of their correlation to Collective
Memory, which is lower and for Two-Way Communication not
signiﬁcant at the .01 level. These ﬁndings indicate that there is a strong
relationship between the dependant and the independent constructs.
However, some of the independent variables where somewhat inter-
correlated. However the degree of multi-collinearity is not problematic
because all variance inﬂation factor (VIF) values are below 10, the
benchmark suggested by Neter et al. (1990). In the regression analysis,
only some of the proposed relationships were not statistically signiﬁcant
(Tables 4 and 5). Therefore, revised models were developed, where the
links among variables not statistically signiﬁcant at the .10 level were
deleted using stepwise regression. Both regression analyses showed
respectable explanatory power, since adjusted R2 was .25 and .33
respectively. Given that other constructs can also inﬂuence the
relationships with brands, the exploratory power of the models cannot
be undervalued. Tables 4 and 5 present the results of the regression
analyses for Two-Way Communication and Emotional Exchange,
reporting both the full and the revised model as extracted, using
stepwise regression. For both dimensions of Brand Relationship, it is
apparent that the best predictors are the Brand Tribalism variables,
rather than the Long Term Reputation variables. The Passion in Life and
the Reference Group Acceptance seem to be the most inﬂuential factors
in the determination of Two-Way Communication and the Emotional
Exchange, with Passion in Life having an even more signiﬁcant role in
the formation of Emotional Exchange. The Degree of Fit with Lifestyle,
Social Visibility and Brand Reputation are also contributing to a certain
extent in the formation of Brand Relationships. The Sustainable Image
and the Collective Memory do not seem to have a statistically signiﬁcant
relationship with two dimensions of Brand Relationships at a .01 level.
Even in the full model it is apparent that they do not contribute in a
manner worth mentioning to the formation of Two-Way Communica-
tion or the Emotional Exchange.

8. General discussion

Due to the changes in the manner companies market their brands
and the tactics that actually can contribute to the long term prosperity
of brands, the concept of Brand Relationship is increasingly receiving

the attention of academic researchers. On the surface brand commu-
nities resemble associations in their offers to members. Afﬁliations,
access and forums for sharing experiences and other considered
important trends. However, something else is taking place here,
something that many organizations have to fully comprehend and
successfully integrate in their business models. Consumers them-
selves, not by a centralized source generate the know-how and content
in these groups. They play a new role as sources of knowledge and are
potentially a new precursor of radically new ways in which they may
conduct consumption and presumption exchanges in the future.

Part of today’s brand success lays on the development of relationships
between the brands and the consumers as well as the brand’s ownership
and consumption experience in informal brand communities, or brand
tribes. However the academic literature only recently examines these
concepts the academic literature and the research attempting to link the
two is extremely limited. This exploratory research investigates the role
of long term brand reputation and brand tribalism in the development of
relationships.

The results of this analysis are somewhat surprising. The existing
literature examining the development of relationships has established
that the brand itself is important for the formation and the prosperity of
relationships. However, these results suggest that brand tribalism is
more important than brand reputation in the formation of relationships.
This, on its own, is an interesting ﬁnding. Clearly there is an indication
that the producers lose the control of the manner in which their
customers see their brands.

In the academic literature there was some discussion stating that
brand communities are of importance and also of interest. Academics
and practitioners agree that brand communities may have a very
inﬂuential role in the development of the brand image. Therefore brand
teams often try to ﬁnd ways to inﬂuence brand communities, in an
attempt to maintain the control of their brand in an indirect manner.
However, the results of this research highlight the importance of
customer groups and the interaction between brand fans. The foreseen
trend could mean that in the future the producers will be facing a
challenge, as they will be offering brands that will develop their own
character, over which the actual producer will have limited control.
Although one would expect that this trend will be more profound in
products and brands that consumers will be more involved with, this
could be a start of a new era for brand management. Given that the
effectiveness of the traditional brand support methods, such as mass
communication, constantly drops, brand teams might need to ﬁnd new
innovative ways to keep some control over the reputation of their
brands, through brand communities. Even very creative brand identities
could be negatively affected, since the relationship consumers build

with brands are far more inﬂuenced by other consumers, that consume
the brand, rather than what producers actually propose as character-
istics of their brand. This could be an indication of reduced conﬁdence in
producers from the part of consumers, or it may be a trend that today
consuming and sharing the experience with others is becoming
increasingly important.

Practicing managers will beneﬁt from some implied assumptions
that this study offers. A certain antecedent, the Passion in Life
attribute, triggers the degree of ﬁt with speciﬁc consumers’ lifestyles
and the brand itself. The same perceived brand features inﬂuence
consumers; Collective Memory of consumers, which many reﬂect a
reference group cohesion. Furthermore, the contribution of the brand
to the improvement of consumers’ lives and their sense of emotional
authenticity enhances the Social Visibility of the Brand name.

It is clear that brand relationships can become more sustainable
when they are “bottom-up” tribal brands. The perceived contribution
of the brand to consumers, as well as their own acceptance of a
particular reference group membership, will help in the development
of true emotional exchange and true two-way communication
between brands and consumers Although, as expected, factors such
as the Degree of Fit with consumer lifestyles, the Social Visibility of the
Brand and the Brand Reputation itself all have an impact on the
formation of brand relationships, the effective contribution of the
brand to ameliorate consumer lives (Passion in Life) has a dominant
role in the formation of an Emotional Exchange with the brand. Passion
in Life can greatly enhance the consumption experience and brand
communities increasingly play a vital role in shaping the shift from
“matter to mind” in consumption. It is evident from this study that
Brand Tribalism is becoming a more prominent element to be taken
into account in marketing decision making as compared to just brand
reputation, especially when forming true and sustainable relationships
with consumers. Consumers are showing reduced conﬁdence in terms
of trusting brands and wish to engage in co-creation of value.

9. Limitations and further research

This study has certain shortcomings. Although the data was
collected in a big city, the geographic area was limited. The sampling
procedure was not probabilistic, with no quota. A great proportion of
the respondents are younger consumers, who might have different
behavior than older consumers. However, this is acceptable due to the
type of product. The nature of the examined community is not formal.
The degree of afﬁliation with the community was decided on the
extent in which respondents identiﬁed with community features. It
can also be argues that they were demonstrating some degree of tribal
behavior. The respondents were forced to choose between two brands,
as supposed to spontaneous choice of a brand to which they feel they
are more afﬁliated. Furthermore, students collected the data and this
could have inﬂuenced the results.

This research identiﬁes issues that merit further investigation. It
would be valuable to additionally examine the role of brand tribalism
in the development of brand relationships. The ﬁndings of this
research could be context speciﬁc. Future research should also
examine the role brand tribes play in the acceptance of brand
decisions or on constructs like brand loyalty. Other studies could use
other statistical analysis methods, possibly neural networks typology.
