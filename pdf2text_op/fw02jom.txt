Abstract

This paper investigated the relationship between Internet-enabled supply chain integration strategies and performance in
manufacturing and services. It summarizes the literature on demand and supply integration and describes four web-based
strategies. A stratiﬁed random sample was collected from UK manufacturers and services, and there was strong evidence
that demand chain management (DCM) led to the highest performance in manufacturing, but few signs of DCM in services.
Manufacturers and services relying on only web-based demand or supply integration outperformed their low integration
counterparts, but lagged DCM in manufacturing. The study also investigated DCM adoption drivers and found that rational
efﬁciency and bandwagon effects drove change. The ﬁndings have some important implications for theory as well as for
manufacturing and service companies interested in improving their performance.

1. Introduction

The most admired (and feared) competitors today
are companies that link their customers and suppliers
together into tightly integrated networks using what
is now commonly called demand chain management
(DCM). DCM is deﬁned as practice that manages
and coordinates the supply chain from end-customers
backwards to suppliers (Vollmann et al., 2000).
Speciﬁcally, end-customers trigger actions up the sup-
ply chain and products and services are pulled (not
pushed) from one link to the next based upon demand
(Lummus and Vokurka, 1999).

Although we have know about the theoretical bene-
ﬁts of DCM for many years, making it work in practice
was typically impossible before the Internet. DCM re-
quires extensive up- and downstream integration be-
tween all business partners in order to succeed and
these types of connections have only recently become
possible due to the web. Notably, in pre-Internet days
there were no great solutions to the tradeoffs between
low cost, rich content, real-time data and broad de-
ployment across supply chains using traditional meth-
ods, such as EDI and Kanban.

In contrast, the Internet effectively resolved these
tradeoffs and allowed the types of integration neces-
sary between every partner in the supply chain. Where
real-time demand information and inventory visibility
were once impossible, web-based technologies are
now increasing indispensable for supply chain fore-
casting, planning, scheduling and execution. Real-time
information travels immediately backwards though

these web-based, demand-driven supply chains while
inventory ﬂows swiftly forwards. Most importantly,
goods and services are delivered quickly and reliably
when and where they are needed. The more integrated
the ﬂow of data between customers and suppliers, the
easier it also becomes to balance supply and demand
across the entire network. Together, greater online
coordination with associated reduced lead times helps
defeat the bullwhip effect and contributes to higher
performance (Lee et al., 1997a).

Given that DCM is potentially a powerful strate-
gic weapon, there are still many unanswered questions
about its use in practice. Notably, we know little about
what differentiates manufacturers and services regard-
ing demand-driven supply chains and our knowledge
is especially weak concerning modern Internet-based
integration in all sectors (Bowersox et al., 2000). Com-
petitive advantage comes from seamlessly coordinat-
ing operations across demand-driven chains, but which
web-based integration strategies lead to the highest
performance?

Our investigation was especially motivated by the
possibility that manufacturing and services are sufﬁ-
ciently different enough that it affects the need for
DCM. This study, therefore, contributes to the ﬁeld
by simultaneously analyzing the relationships between
demand and supply integration and performance in

both a manufacturing and service context. The paper
also extends our knowledge about the implementa-
tion of supply chain improvements and adds evidence
to this emerging stream of literature on the adoption
drivers behind the use of demand-driven chains.

2. Demand and supply integration, conceptual
framework and hypotheses

2.1. Demand integration

Integration is “to make into a whole” (Oxford
English dictionary) and substantial previous research
highlights many opportunities separately associated
with either demand or supply integration (Table 1). In
terms of the demand-side of companies, major chal-
lenges are improving demand visibility and planning
in supply chains (Fisher et al., 1994). “Distorted infor-
mation from one end of the supply chain to the other
can lead to tremendous inefﬁciencies: excess inven-
tory investment, poor customer service, lost revenues,
misguided capacity plans, ineffective transportation
and missed production schedules” (Lee et al., 1997b,
p. 93). One trend is integrating up- and downstream
information to coordinate non-vertically integrated
ﬁrms (Mabert and Venkataramanan, 1998). Since
planning instability is magniﬁed up supply chains,

controlling this ampliﬁcation is vital for good demand
management (Bhaskaran, 1998). Successful demand
integration, therefore, typically relies on information
technologies including the Internet (Bowersox et al.,
2000) and involves shared data between planning
and control systems (Bowersox and Daugherty, 1995;
Narasimhan and Carter, 1998).

Other important issues regarding demand integra-
tion include the need for efﬁcient and rapid deliv-
ery (Cachon and Fisher, 1997; Clark and Hammond,
1997), as well as improved logistics communication
(Corbett et al., 1999). At the core of demand-driven
supply chains, therefore, are the basics of forecast in-
tegration, inventory reductions and the elimination of
non-valued added activities (Claycomb et al., 1999).

2.2. Supply integration

Other studies have investigated the supply-side in-
tegration of companies (Table 1). Krause et al. (1998)
pointed out that many companies seek supplier im-
provements in delivery and cost. As Handﬁeld (1993,
p. 290) noted, supply integration typically means
“obtaining frequent deliveries in small lots, using sin-
gle or dual sources of supply, evaluating alternative
sources on the basis of quality and delivery instead of
price, establishing long term contracts with suppliers,
reducing buffer inventories and eliminating formal
paperwork.” Integrated supply not only reduces costs
but also improves lead times (Ansari and Modarress,

1990). Other beneﬁts from supply integration include
improved supplier reliability (Carr and Pearson, 1999)
and communication (Freeland, 1991). Studies have,
therefore, consistently linked supplier integration to
greater performance (Chapman and Carter, 1990;
Akinc, 1993; Lawrence and Hottenstein, 1995;
Agrawal and Nahmias, 1997; Tan et al., 1998).

2.3. Four web-based demand and supply
integration strategies and hypotheses

While it has always been theoretically possible to
broadly integrate with customers and suppliers, it is
only recently through a combination of theory and the
Internet that it has become practical (Bowersox et al.,
2000). Pre-Internet, real-time demand information
and inventory visibility were typically impossible to
achieve and most supply and demand “integration”
involved a patchwork of telephoning, faxing and
EDI. This has changed in the Internet era and widely
available web-based technologies now permit strong
customer and supplier integration for inventory plan-
ning, demand forecasting, order scheduling, targeted
marketing and customer relationship management.
New Internet technologies, overlaid on the traditional
demand and supply integration practices discussed
above, present four strategic options shown in Fig. 1.
At one extreme is a strategy of little or no web-based
integration (model A). At the other end of the con-
tinuum is a strategy with high levels of web-based

integration coordinating the whole demand chain from
customers backwards to suppliers popularly called
DCM (model D). In between these polar extremes
are companies whose strategies involve web-based
integration with either their suppliers (model B) or
customers (model C).

The DCM strategy (model D) should deliver the
highest levels of performance. The higher the level of
traditional integration with suppliers and customers
the greater the beneﬁts (Frohlich and Westbrook,
2001) and the Internet should only reinforce this rela-
tionship. Given the partial nature of their web-based
integration, the performance for the supply integra-
tion (model B) and the demand integration (model
C) strategies should logically fall between the low
integration (model A) and DCM (model D) ap-
proaches. While integrating with the supply-side gives
higher performance than for low integration compa-
nies (Germain and Droge, 1998; Tan et al., 1998)
and demand-side coordination also improves results
(Daugherty et al., 1999; Waller et al., 1999), partially
deploying web-based technologies on one-side of a
company should still only deliver limited beneﬁts. Fi-
nally, as with the ﬁndings for traditional supply chain
management (Narasimhan and Jayaram, 1998), a low
integration strategy (model A) in the Internet era
should deliver the fewest beneﬁts. These arguments
lead to the ﬁrst set of hypotheses.

H1a. Manufacturers and services adopting a web-
based DCM integration strategy (model D) will have
the highest levels of operational performance.

H1b. Manufacturers and services adopting either a
web-based supply (model B) or demand (model C)
integration strategy will have medium levels of oper-
ational performance.

H1c. Manufacturers and services adopting a low
web-based integration strategy (model A) will have
the lowest levels of operational performance.

2.4. Three drivers of web-based demand and
supply integration and hypotheses

While the adoption of new managerial techniques
like Internet-based DCM seems faddish,
there is
strong theoretical evidence that companies actually

adopt practices for both rational efﬁciency and band-
wagon reasons (Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1993).
Rational efﬁciency theory holds that if more orga-
nizations adopt a technique, then greater knowledge
about the innovation’s efﬁciency and beneﬁts are cre-
ated (Abrahamson, 1996). When this knowledge is
shared between companies, eventually more and more
non-adopters will rationally adopt the concept be-
cause of the innovation’s inherent efﬁciency (Rogers,
1983; Mansﬁeld, 1985).

The literature correspondingly suggests two ra-
tional efﬁciency explanations for DCM’s adoption.
The ﬁrst driver is greater access to new markets.
DCM is perceived in many industries as one of the
most powerful tools presently available for creating
real competitive advantage (Vollmann et al., 2000).
By providing customers with unrivaled beneﬁts,
demand-driven supply chains not only allow compa-
nies to better satisfy existing clients but also to win
over the most proﬁtable customers in new markets.
Widely-cited examples of using DCM to gain market
share and dominate the competition include Zara’s
case in the fashion industry (Walker et al., 2000) and
Dell’s model in computers (Magretta, 1998). Com-
panies, therefore, rationally adopt DCM in a quest to
serve new markets and win customers.

The second rational efﬁciency argument for adopt-
ing DCM is the anticipated internal performance
improvement.
In theory, better coordination re-
duces uncertainty throughout networks (Davis, 1993;
Lee et al., 1997a) and lets inventory and ﬁnished
goods move more efﬁciently. This better coordina-
tion translates into reduced variability and eliminates
non-value-adding activities, which in turn leads to
greater operational performance (Metters, 1997; Lee
and Tang, 1998; Grout, 1998). Famous examples of
such improvements include Hewlett-Packard’s dra-
matic decrease in printer inventory carrying costs due
to DCM and postponement (Billington, 1994) as well
as National Semiconductor’s large reductions in deliv-
ery times and distribution costs (Henfoff, 1994). Based
upon these (and other) early adopter success stories,
subsequent companies may have rationally adopted
DCM to improve their own internal performance.

The other main driver of new practice adoption
is the so-called “bandwagon” effect. Bandwagons
are diffusion processes whereby organizations adopt
innovations, not because of any rational efﬁciency

assessment of the practice, but because of external
pressure caused by the large number of organizations
that have already adopted (or are considering adopt-
ing) the concept (Tolbert and Zucker, 1983). In some
cases, even after companies have assessed new meth-
ods as highly inefﬁcient and likely to cause losses,
they are still adopted because of bandwagon pressures
(Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1993). The pursuit of
legitimacy (Scott, 1995) leads to a technique’s adop-
tion because management is more afraid of being
perceived by customers, suppliers, investors and com-
petitors as industry laggards than any legitimate fears
about misapplying the practice. When innovations are
new or poorly understood, following the lead of other
organizations (whether right or wrong) is often the
simplest way forward (March and Olsen, 1976). Exter-
nal pressures can thus drive the adoption of web-based
methods like DCM, regardless of their inherent ben-
eﬁts. Rational efﬁciency and bandwagon theory to-
gether support this study’s second set of hypotheses
and the overall conceptual framework shown in Fig. 2.

3. Methods

3.1. Data collection

The survey was developed in three stages. In the ﬁrst
stage, we identiﬁed relevant measures of web-based

demand and supply integration, drivers and perfor-
mance in the literature and drafted the instrument. We
held a series of meetings with managers in the sec-
ond stage to gauge the content and face validity of the
instrument. In the ﬁnal stage, we pre-tested the sur-
vey with 30 manufacturers and service ﬁrms to further
gauge its content validity and overall readability.

Data were collected from a stratiﬁed random sample
of manufacturing and service companies from across
UK. The research design proportionally represented
large and small companies, and we sampled from all
13 regions of the UK including Scotland and Wales. In
terms of external validity, the UK is the world’s fourth
largest economy (behind the US, Japan and Germany)
and the nation’s e-business adoption rate generalizes
well to North America and continental Europe. By
sampling an entire country, the research design also
controlled for many confounding factors like telecom-
munication infrastructure, technology costs, govern-
ment programs and the overall economy.

Typical respondents were VPs of Operations or
General Managers and therefore, the data were col-
lected from managers with enough seniority to know
about their companies’ up and downstream integra-
tion, DCM drivers and performance. The data col-
lection was completed in early 2001 and followed
Dillman’s (1978) total design method. The industry
breakdown of the sample is shown in Table 2. In to-
tal, 890 usable surveys were returned and the survey
response rate was 20%.

(SIC) deﬁnitions, manufacturing establishments (SIC

new products while service establishments (SIC Di-
visions E–I) are engaged in providing a wide variety
of services for individuals, business and government
establishments, and other organizations. Perhaps most
importantly, the literature has long noted important
differences between manufacturing and services ﬁrms
(McColgan, 1997). Notably, service operations have
unique characteristics that are rarely found in man-
ufacturing including customer participation,
intan-
gibility, inseparability of production and consump-
tion, heterogeneity, perishability and labor intensity
(Nie and Kellogg, 1999). The direct participation of
customers in the service process adds complexity that
is generally not found in manufacturing (Chase and
Tansik, 1983). Moreover, direct customer participation
means that service ﬁrms tend to have many more phys-
ical sites than manufacturers along with the unique
challenges presented by wide geographic dispersion.
Intangibility is often cited as another fundamental
difference between goods and services since a ser-
vice cannot be seen, touched or tasted in the same
manner as a manufactured product (Fitzsimmons and
Fitzsimmons, 1997). Services also tend to have higher
heterogeneity and thus can be either deliberately or
accidentally customized between different service
providers and customers in comparison to the greater
process standardization of a typical manufacturer’s
production. Services are likewise more perishable

than physical products given that unused capacity
is lost forever. This perishability leads to difﬁculties
in managing demand, utilizing capacity, planning
services and scheduling labor. Finally, services are
typically more labor intensive in comparison to man-
ufacturing (Heskett, 1986) and hence manufacturers
can often realize more productivity gains through
technological innovations (Quinn and Gagnon, 1986).

3.1.2. Data classiﬁcation procedure and response
accuracy tests

In order to best isolate the differences between
manufacturing and services, this study focused on
the predominately manufacturing only (n = 187) and
predominately services only (n = 298) sub-samples
of the 890 total responses collected. The other 405
cases, involving both mixed manufacturing/services
and unclassiﬁable companies, were not used for
this analysis. This three-group classiﬁcation follows
Nie and Kellogg’s (1999) logic when they investigated
service research and teaching in OM and categorized
167 members of ‘Decision Sciences’ and ‘INFORMS’
into manufacturing, service or mixed types.

We sorted the data into the correct groups based
upon a multi-step process. First, the research team
classiﬁed each case into either: (1) predominately
manufacturing; (2) predominately services; or (3)
mixed manufacturing/services
and unclassiﬁable

companies based upon an objective database called
‘ﬁnancial analysis made easy’ (FAME) that holds 10
years data on 2.7 million UK companies including
their industry, company type, SIC codes and trade de-
scriptions. Where necessary, we also triangulated with
other databases, such as LEXIS-NEXIS and PRO-
QUEST and at times even logged onto companies’
websites in order to determine which classiﬁcation
that they belonged in.

Second, we set up an acceptance sampling plan
for directly telephoning a random subset of all the
respondents in order to ensure that we had cor-
rectly classiﬁed them into one of the three groups.
We followed a conservative sampling plan with
AQL = 0.01, LTPD = 0.05, type-I error (α) = 0.05,
and type-II error (β) = 0.10. This plan required
us to telephone 137 (n) respondents with a criti-
cal value (c) of three and ask them to self-classify
their own organizations. All but one company was
correctly classiﬁed, which suggested that we had suc-
cessfully isolated the predominately manufacturing
and predominately service companies in our sub-
samples.

As an additional test, we had embedded in the sur-
vey several randomly spaced questions related to the
design of products and new product development that
only applied to companies which manufactured prod-
ucts. As expected, based upon ANOVA and the Scheffé
method, there was an overwhelmingly signiﬁcant dif-
ference (P < 0.001) in the mean emphasis on design-
ing products and new product development between
the predominately manufacturing and services groups.
This further supported our data classiﬁcation.

Three months after the original sample was col-
lected, 150 of
the responding companies were
re-contacted and asked to complete a second survey
with a different respondent to help test response ac-
curacy. Thirty-seven companies participated,
there
were no differences (P < 0.05) on selected measures
and the inter-rater reliability was satisfactory per
Boyer and Verma’s (2000) guidelines. Similar to the
above acceptance sampling, we again checked in this
second survey to ensure that the companies were
correctly classiﬁed as predominately manufacturing
versus predominately services. All of the 37 responses
were correctly classiﬁed.

We also compared a matched random sample of 60
responding and non-responding companies to assess

non-response bias and found no differences (P <
0.05) in terms of size, age, location or industry. Since
a single respondent rated integration, drivers and per-
formance, this may have led to common-method bias
that we checked for using Harmon’s one-factor test
(Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). Six factors with eigen-
values greater than one were extracted from all the
measures in this study and in total accounted for 67%
of the variance. The ﬁrst factor accounted for 23%
of the variance. Since a single factor did not emerge
and one-factor did not account for most of the vari-
ance, this suggested that the results were not due to
common-method bias.

3.2. Scale development

Respondents were asked to rate on multi-item scales
(Appendix A) their degree of web-based integration
with suppliers and customers, DCM drivers and per-
formance. These scales were grounded in the literature
(O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka, 1998) and conﬁrmatory
factor analysis was used to ensure reliability (Kim and
Mueller, 1978). All scales were unidimensional us-
ing principal components as shown in the Appendix
A. The scales were summed averages of the measure-
ment items and reliability (Table 3) was acceptable
(Nunnally, 1968). Table 3 also shows the measures’
Pearson correlations.

The reliability and validity of each scale and objec-
tive measure were further analyzed following Flynn
et al.’s (1995) example. Construct validity was es-
tablished by testing whether the items in a scale all
loaded on a common factor when within-scale fac-
tor analysis was run. Appendix A shows that the
eigenvalues all exceeded the threshold of 1.0, which
supports each scale’s dimensionality. Divergent or
discriminant validity was tested three ways. Bivari-
ate correlations were checked between each of the
scale’s measures and other potentially confounding
variables included in the instrument such as location,
company age, lack of previous demonstrated beneﬁts
and adequate external advice (Table 4). There were
no signiﬁcant correlations (P < 0.05), which helped
establish that the scales were not measuring other
unintended constructs. Second, we compared the av-
erage inter-scale correlations in Table 4 to the α’s
in Table 3. Acceptable divergent validity is shown
when the α’s are greater than the average inter-scale

correlations. Finally, the average correlations between
scale and non-scale items were lower than between
scale and scale items that helped support discriminant
validity.

Cluster analysis was used to conﬁrm the four
web-based integration strategies predicted in Fig. 1.
Methodologists advocate using a two-stage cluster
procedure whereby a hierarchical algorithm deter-
mines the number of clusters and starting means, and
then a non-hierarchical method is run for ﬁnal clus-
tering (Punj and Stewart, 1983; Ketchen and Shook,
1996). This combined approach was used with SPSS’s
hierarchical Ward’s method (squared Euclidean dis-
tance) and K-means (quick cluster) non-hierarchical
algorithm. The most appropriate number of clusters
were determined using multiple methods (Ketchen
and Shook, 1996). First, the dendogram for the clus-
ter analysis was inspected to conﬁrm the number

of major groups (Aldenderfer and Blashﬁeld, 1984).
Second, the incremental changes in the agglomeration
coefﬁcient were checked for relatively large increases
that implied dissimilar clusters were merged (Ketchen
and Shook, 1996). Third, a split-half analysis was
conducted to assess the reliability of the four-cluster
model. We selected a six-cluster solution as the
starting point for the split-half analysis and tested
six-, ﬁve-, four-, three- and two-cluster models. The
four-cluster solutions in each of the two split-halves
shared the most uniform similarities. Finally, the de-
cision to employ a four-cluster solution was based
on interpretability. Moving from ﬁve- to four-cluster
solution combined similar clusters, whereas moving
from four- to three-cluster solution forced together
dissimilar clusters.

ufacturing companies. As expected, the manufactur-

ing sample contained all four integration strategies.
Surprisingly, the service sub-sample contained only
one DCM (model D) company and no supply integra-
tion (model B) organizations. Although conﬁdentiality
prevents us from naming the one DCM service com-
pany, it is a large and well-known transportation and
distribution company.

We ran discriminant analysis to ensure that the four
integration strategies were correctly classiﬁed follow-
ing Miller and Roth’s (1994) example. The demand
and supply measures were entered as independent vari-
ables with cluster membership (models A to D) as the
dependent. Table 6 shows that 92.78% of the cluster
groups were correctly classiﬁed indicating extremely
good differentiation and well above the 25% correct
classiﬁcation expected by chance.

4. Results

4.1. Supply and demand integration strategies and
performance in manufacturing and services

We tested the ﬁrst set of hypotheses, concerning the
relationships between web-based integration strategies
and performance in manufacturing and services, us-
ing ANOVA and the Scheffé method. Table 7 shows
signiﬁcant (P < 0.01) differences between the four
strategies.

There was good support for H1a that manufac-
turers adopting the DCM strategy (model D) have
the highest
levels of performance. Though few
in absolute number, as seen in Table 7 the DCM
manufacturing companies consistently matched or

exceeded the other three groups’ performance. H1a
for services, however, was rejected. While the per-
formance of the lone DCM service company was
higher than the other three strategies the sample size
was not large enough to draw a meaningful statistical
conclusion.

There was also good support for H1b that manu-
facturers adopting either web-based supply (model
B) or demand (model C) integration strategies would
have medium levels of performance. As shown in
Table 7, while the web-based supply and demand in-
tegration strategies statistically equaled or exceeded
the low integration group (model A),
the DCM
manufacturing companies outperformed them. There
was only mixed support for H1b among the service
companies. No web-based supply integration ser-
vice companies were discovered in our sample, but
the demand-integrated (model C) services signiﬁ-
cantly (P < 0.01) outperformed the low integration
group.

Hypothesis H1c, that manufacturers and services
adopting the low integration strategy will have the low-
est levels of performance, was strongly supported. As
seen in Table 7, the low integration strategy in both
manufacturing and services had signiﬁcantly worse
performance in comparison to the supply, demand and
DCM integration groups.

As a further evaluation of H1a, H1b and H1c, the
manufacturing and service sub-sets were merged to-
gether and general factorial ANOVA was run to test
the effect of web-based integration (models A–D) on
mean performance. As shown in Table 8, the overall
model was signiﬁcant (P < 0.01) and the higher the

was tested using logistic regression. Logistic regres-
sion estimates the coefﬁcients of a probabilistic model
of independent variables that best predict the value
of a dichotomous dependent variable. This procedure
was used because the dependent variable is dichoto-
mous (adoption/non-adoption of a web-based inte-
gration strategy) which violates a basic assumption
of multiple regression. Three separate logistic regres-
sion analyses were done using the combined data
(n = 471) for manufacturing and services in Table 5.
For example, to test for the drivers of web-based
supply integration (model C) the 36 adopters were
ﬁrst coded “1” and the 435 non-adopters “0”. This
dichotomous dependent variable was then tested with
the three predicted independent drivers of web-based
integration (anticipated beneﬁts, new markets and
external pressure). The logistic regression runs for
web-based demand (model C) and DCM integration
(model D) were similarly coded 1/0 for adopters and
non-adopters.

Table 9 shows the results. The non-signiﬁcant χ 2
goodness-of-ﬁt statistics for the three analyses (0.796
for supply, 0.322 for demand and 0.889 for DCM inte-
gration) supports the null hypotheses that the logistic
regression models were not signiﬁcantly different from
the perfect model that correctly classiﬁes all respon-
dents into their respective adopter/non-adopter groups.
Given the relatively large sample size and R2, the sta-
tistical powers (with 1% type-I error) for all three lo-
gistic regression models were >99%. These statistical
powers all exceeded the recommended 80% threshold
(Cohen, 1988) and further suggest a high degree of
accuracy in identifying important drivers (i.e. predic-
tors) of the three integration strategies.

The logistic regression coefﬁcient (β) indicate the
direction and magnitude of each variable’s inﬂuence
on the odds of adopting that integration strategy. If β
for a variable is signiﬁcant and greater than zero, an
increase of one unit in the variable increases the odds
of adopting that integration strategy. As for individ-
ual factors, the β coefﬁcients of anticipated beneﬁts
were signiﬁcantly different from zero (P < 0.01) for
all three strategies. The β of new markets were sig-
niﬁcant for demand (model C) and DCM (model D)
integration, but it was not a driver of supply integra-
tion. External pressure was signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) for
DCM integration and had a borderline signiﬁcant ef-
fect (P = 0.054) for supply integration. The overall

rank order of the β’s suggests that the rational efﬁ-
ciency hypotheses of anticipated beneﬁts and new mar-
kets mainly drove demand chain integration. External
pressure and the bandwagon effect was a somewhat
less important driver.

5. Discussion and suggestions for further research

In this section, we discuss the main ﬁndings in this
order: the relevance or otherwise of DCM for service
organizations, the relationship of integration strategy
and integration drivers, and the importance of DCM
in manufacturing.

5.1. DCM in services

While these ﬁndings suggest that DCM is an im-
portant development for manufacturers, they do not
support a similar claim for service companies. There
are three possible explanations for our results. First,
it may simply be the case that services are lagging
several years behind manufacturing in terms of DCM
and thus nothing showed up in our sample. Assuming
that services lags manufacturing in adopting practice,
however, is dangerous. While manufactures may have
pioneered programs like TQM, JIT and cells in the
1980s, many services were just as aggressive as man-
ufacturers at implementing ERP, re-engineering and
the Internet in the 1990s.

The second possible reason for our ﬁnding may
be a limitation in the data. The sample contained
a wide variety of service companies, but only a
relatively few total number of retailers (n = 6)
and grocery/food distribution companies (n = 12).
Many of the examples in the practitioner literature
of DCM in services seem to be from these sectors
(e.g. Wal-Mart or Tesco), and if our sample was
considerably larger then we might have found more
evidence of this strategy. While our ﬁndings suggest
that DCM does not readily apply in services, future
research merits investigating DCM in a larger strati-
ﬁed sample of retailers and grocery/food distribution
companies.

Certainly services should not in this context be
seen as a single homogeneous category. There are
differences between retailers that hold some physi-
cal inventory and consulting ﬁrms whose costs are

dominated by personnel expenditures. While our
ﬁndings suggest that DCM does not readily apply in
services, future research which used a richer clas-
siﬁcation scheme like Chopra and Meindl’s (2001)
implied uncertainty and responsiveness dimensions,
might reveal a greater range of DCM beneﬁts and
relevance.

The ﬁnal plausible reason for this ﬁnding may
be that DCM does not matter in services. The bane
of physical products is inventory build-up due to
the bullwhip effect in the supply chain. Does the
bullwhip phenomen on really exist
in a service
context? Services are simultaneously produced and
consumed and cannot be inventoried. If something
cannot be inventoried, does the bullwhip effect
apply?

Typically for manufacturers, materials are often
over 60% of costs while labor is under 15% so many
supply chain savings naturally come from inventory
reductions and transportation efﬁciencies. Similarly,
manufacturing delays and stockouts are frequently
caused by a few late inbound raw materials so most
manufacturers can beneﬁt from sharing real-time de-
mand information with their upstream partners. In
services,
the materials/labor ratio is often the re-
verse of that in manufacturing and service supply
chains normally involve human skills over mate-
rial ﬂows (Cox et al., 2001). Service stockouts are,
therefore, mainly driven by underestimating future
demand and lacking sufﬁcient capacity (i.e. service
providers) on the day that customers actually ar-
rive in the process. While no doubt stafﬁng levels
and queue sizes between partners in service supply

chains are important, is sharing real-time demand
data with suppliers and improving inventory visibility
over relatively few materials really that strategic in
services?

Although beyond the scope of this paper,

the
bullwhip effect in services needs to be more thor-
oughly documented. If there is a signiﬁcant bullwhip
in services,
then DCM probably makes sense. If
the bullwhip is not a signiﬁcant factor, then service
providers may have the luxury of only concentrating
on the web-based demand integration (model C) that
23% of the service companies in this study pursued.
This parallels Watson’s (2001, p. 41) services ﬁnd-
ing that for insurance companies, while downstream
customer integration was straightforward, upstream
integration “remains little more than an unfulﬁlled
desire”.

5.2. Integration strategy and integration drivers

The next major ﬁnding is that the drivers of in-
tegration vary depending on the type of strategy.
While all three integration strategies were partially
driven by the anticipated beneﬁts of the practice, the
demand-driven strategies (models C and D) were also
strongly motivated by the rational access to new mar-
kets. Conversely, the supply-driven integration strate-
gies (models B and D) had external pressure driving
their adoption. This suggests that demand integration
is more driven by proactive rational efﬁciency factors
like performance and market share, while reactive
bandwagon pressures are an important driver behind
web-based supply integration.


M.T. Frohlich, R. Westbrook / Journal of Operations Management 20 (2002) 729–745

741

This ﬁnding is important given the relatively little
evidence that our ﬁeld has accumulated so far con-
cerning the process of implementing supply chain
strategy. Marucheck et al. (1990) noted that OM re-
searchers often tend to pay less theoretical attention to
the process of formulating and implementing strate-
gies in comparison to their deﬁnition and content.
Findings in this study suggest a dual context behind
the process of implementing coordinated up- and
downstream strategies. If only upstream supplier-side
pressures are present,
then companies will evolve
their supply chain strategies in that direction. Con-
versely, if the opportunities from integrating on the
downstream demand-side outweigh the costs then a
company’s supply chain strategy will naturally de-
velop in that direction. It seems likely that only when
upstream supply pressures and downstream market
opportunities collide that companies take the ultimate
step and implement DCM. This is an important insight
for managers—the time may not be right to imple-
ment broad supply chain integration until upstream
pressures and downstream opportunities are both
present.

5.3. The importance of DCM for manufacturing

This study strongly suggests that DCM is currently
the most powerful web-based integration strategy
that a manufacturer can adopt. Although this has
been an assumption behind much of the recent DCM
literature, this is the ﬁrst time that it has been demon-
strated empirically with a large group of companies
from the integrated perspective that Narasimhan and
Jayaram (1998) argued for. The results in partic-
ular suggest that DCM has the strong potential to
differentiate manufacturing performance. The low
integration manufacturers recorded the lowest per-
formance, while the highly successful DCM group
enjoyed the powerful beneﬁts of up- and downstream
integration.

The companies in this group are unlikely of course
to owe all their performance achievement to DCM;
such a high degree of integration is typically an ex-
tension of earlier initiatives, such as JIT and other
supply chain improvements, which give performance
enhancements of their own. But
the extra perfor-
mance edge found in this group can reasonably be
associated with the use of the Internet and DCM to

give that superior supply chain coordination which
reduces uncertainty throughout networks (Lee et al.,
1997a),
lets inventory move more efﬁciently, and
reduces variability (Metters, 1997).

6. Conclusions

In conclusion, we offer some reﬂections on the im-
plications for managers of our study. First, the DCM
strategy appeared to be the best overall approach for
manufacturers to follow and the relatively few man-
ufacturers that are already following this approach
should, therefore, continue holding the course and
perhaps even increase integration with suppliers and
customers wherever possible. Conversely, for most
services the best approach right now is to focus on de-
mand integration. Although this study’s ﬁndings need
replication before any ﬁnal prescription can be made, it
may be a waste of resources for services to chase either
supplier integration or full-blown DCM integration.

Manufacturers already pursuing the supply and
demand integration strategies have the simplest next
steps. Although easier said than done, these groups
need to make the ﬁnal leap and begin integrating the
up or downstream sides of their supply chains using
the Internet. The low integration manufacturers and
services, on the other hand, have a much harder task.
They need to start implementing the web-based sup-
ply and demand integration that unlocks performance.
Although this is a daunting task, the alternative of try-
ing to compete without integration is worse since their
survival may ultimately be at stake. Enhanced compet-
itiveness requires that companies ceaselessly integrate
within a network of organizations—manufacturers
and services ignoring this new challenge are destined
to fall hopelessly behind their more Internet-enabled
rivals.

On the other hand, in the 21st century manufactur-
ers may be seriously jeopardizing their performance
by continuing to follow a low integration approach.
Schmenner and Swink’s (1998) theory of swift, even
ﬂows postulated that the most successful operations
smoothly move raw materials and subassemblies
through processes and into ﬁnished goods. Materials
and ﬁnished goods only move swiftly if there are
no ﬂow impediments in the way and productivity
rises proportionally to the speed that materials move

through processes. By extension, manufacturers not
exploiting the Internet and DCM have little hope of
achieving the swiftest and most even ﬂows.

As expected, results for the web-based supply and
demand integration strategies show that focusing
on only the inbound or the outbound sides provide
marginal beneﬁts. Lee and Billington (1992) and
Hammel and Kopczak (1993) reached similar con-
clusions concerning the dangers of fragmented tra-
ditional supply chains—the same rules apply in the
Internet era.
