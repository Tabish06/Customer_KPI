 The majority of empirical studies on the HRM–performance link report
a positive story. The costs associated with the productivity rise due to high
performance work practices (HPWP) have been largely neglected. The purpose of
this study is to develop a conceptual framework that maps both the value-enhancing
and cost-raising impact of HPWP. In addition, we want to pronounce upon their
overall effect on ﬁnancial performance. To test our model, we rely on a sample of
small businesses. Understanding both performance and cost-related effects of the
implementation of HPWP is particularly valuable for small businesses since they
often lack ﬁnancial resources to implement HPWP and beneﬁt less from economies
of scale compared to their larger counterparts. Study results indicate that although
greater use of HPWP is associated with increased productivity, this effect is offset by
increased labour costs. However, we ﬁnd an overall positive effect of HPWP on ﬁrm
proﬁtability.

INTRODUCTION

Interest in the link between the implementation of high performance work prac-
tices (HPWP) and ﬁrm performance has risen sharply over the past 20 years. Ulrich
described the state of the art in 1997 as follows: ‘HR practices seem to matter;
logic says it is so; survey ﬁndings conﬁrm it’ (Ulrich, 1997, p. 304). However, the
relationship  between  HRM  and  ﬁrm  performance  remains  fuzzy  and  results
depend on the population sampled and the measures used.

More recent empirical articles mainly deal with opening the black box and the
generalization  to  other  (than  Anglo-Saxon)  countries  (Delery  and  Shaw, 2001).
Research on the exploration of the black box falls into two categories. First, a pile
of quantitative studies introduced variables that mediate the link between HRM
and ﬁrm performance (e.g. Huselid, 1995). Examples of these intermediate vari-
ables are employees’ attitudes, behaviours and performance, measured on an orga-
nizational  level. These  studies  are  becoming  more  and  more  methodologically
sophisticated  using  analysis  techniques  such  as  structural  equation  modelling
(Guthrie and Datta, 2004) or longitudinal data to tackle the (reversed) causality
problem  (Cappelli  and  Neumark, 2001). Second, other  authors  (Purcell, 1999;
Truss, 2001) advocate that qualitative research is more appropriate to grasp the
reality of the black box since a discrepancy between intentions of HR managers
and practice experienced by employees might exist. As far as the generalization of
research ﬁndings to other countries is concerned, the number of studies explor-
ing the link between HRM and performance based on other than Anglo-Saxon
and US samples has been growing rapidly over the last few years (Addison et al.,
2000; Bae and Lawler, 2000; Boselie et al., 2001; Fey et al., 2000; Guthrie, 2001;
Khatri, 2000; Lee and Miller, 1999).

The majority of the aforementioned studies starts from the assumption – taken
from  human  capital  theory  (Becker, 1964)  –  that  the  productive  capacity  of
employees  can  be  enhanced  by  investing  in  their  knowledge, skills  and  abilities
(KSAs). Moreover, it  is  believed  that  workers’ productivity  can  be  improved  by
motivating  and  empowering  employees  through  the  introduction  of ‘high  com-
mitment/involvement/performance work practices’ (e.g. Arthur, 1994; Becker and
Huselid, 1998; Delery and Shaw, 2001; Huselid, 1995). We do not question these
assumptions. However, despite  its  value-creating  effect, the  investment  in  HRM
also entails direct and indirect costs (Cappelli and Neumark, 2001; Cooke, 1994).
From an economic point of view, the potential productivity gains of management
practices should be offset against costs associated with the introduction and imple-
mentation of these practices. Following this line of reasoning, investing in HPWP
is only justiﬁed if it pays off in the long term (however difﬁcult it may be to measure
the cost of not implementing these practices). In our opinion, the outline of the
costs  has  been  neglected  in  HRM–performance  research. To  get  insight  in 
the impact of HRM on ﬁrm performance, the complex network of interrelated
positive  (i.e. value-creating)  and  negative  (i.e. cost-increasing)  effects  should  be
uncovered.

The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual framework linking HRM
and  performance  that  maps  both  the  value-enhancing  and  cost-raising  impact.
Moreover, we  want  to  pronounce  upon  their  combined  total  effect  on  ﬁnancial
performance. The  central  question  is  whether  the  development  of an  intensive
HRM system is proﬁtable for smaller organizations.

To test our model, we rely on a sample of small businesses. First, small ﬁrms
represent an ideal ﬁeld for studying the relationship between the implementation
of speciﬁc management practices and ﬁrm performance, because of their more
transparent  nature  (Aldrich  and  Auster, 1986; Katz  et  al., 2000). Second, small
businesses  often  lack  ﬁnancial  resources  to  implement  HPWP  (resource  poverty –
Cassell et al., 2002; Welsh and White, 1981) and beneﬁt less from economies of
scale compared to their larger counterparts. Therefore, the understanding of both
performance and cost-related effects of the implementation of HPWP may be par-
ticularly valuable for small businesses.

Apart from this theoretical contribution, we also want to tackle some method-
ological  concerns. We  use  structural  equation  modelling. This  technique  allows
testing the overall effect of intermediate variables (such as productivity and per-
sonnel  costs)  between  HRM  and  ﬁnancial  performance. Moreover, in  order  to
respond to the (reversed) causality problem, we control for past performance and
build in a time lag between the measurement of HRM (t) and ﬁrm performance
(t + 1).

The article is divided into ﬁve main sections. First, we give a brief overview of
the literature on the HRM–performance link. Second, we turn to the development
of our conceptual framework and formulate research hypotheses. We then clarify
our  research  design. The  fourth  section  elucidates  the  analyses  and  results. We
close with a discussion and some suggestions for future research.

LITERATURE REVIEW

The Value-Creating Effect of HPWP

HPWP do not inﬂuence ﬁrm performance directly, but through a causal chain of
mediating variables. Several authors (Becker et al., 1997; Dyer and Reeves, 1995;
Guest, 2001; Huselid, 1995; Rogers and Wright, 1998) divide performance into
several  hierarchical  levels, with  performance  at  one  level  (e.g. individual  perfor-
mance) contributing to performance at the next level (e.g. organizational perfor-
mance). Although the models found in literature differ in the number of levels and
the exact outcomes, a generic form of the model sketches that HPWP have their
most direct impact on employees’ attitudes (e.g. satisfaction, commitment), behav-
iours  (e.g. voluntary  turnover, absenteeism)  and  performance  (e.g.
individual 
productivity). Changes herein subsequently have an effect on operational organi-
zational performance (e.g. organizational productivity). An increase (or decrease)
in operational performance, in turn, contributes to higher level organizational per-
formance constructs, such as ﬁnancial and market performance.

With regard to the conditions under which HPWP inﬂuence performance, dif-
ferent – but not necessarily contradictory – modes of theorizing exist. Delery and

Doty (1996) give an extensive overview of three alternatives. The universalistic per-
spective states that a ﬁxed set of best practices can create surplus value in various
business contexts. Irrespective of strategy, the introduction of these practices has
an additional effect on performance (Huselid, 1995; Ichniowski and Shaw, 1999;
Pfeffer, 1994). Contingency  approaches, by  contrast, assume  that  the  strategy  used
affects the selection of HPWP; that, in turn, strategic choice is inﬂuenced by envi-
ronmental features and that organizations achieving ‘vertical ﬁt’ between HRM
choices, strategic options and environmental features will outperform other orga-
nizations (Baird and Meshoulam, 1988; Youndt et al., 1996). Finally, the conﬁgura-
tional  perspective is  based  on  a  holistic  system  approach. Here, the  importance  of
horizontal ﬁt and equiﬁnality is emphasized. Horizontal ﬁt implies that efforts must
be  devoted  to  the  implementation  of
internally  consistent  bundles  of HPWP
(Arthur, 1994; MacDufﬁe, 1995). Equiﬁnality  implies  that  various  organizations
may  well  introduce  various  HRM  conﬁgurations  but  can, nonetheless, achieve
equal performance. Each of these modes of theorizing has been tested empirically
(we refer to Erras (2002) for an overview).

Recently, an additional theoretical perspective has emerged. It starts from the
assumption that groups of employees possess skills or perform activities that vary
in importance to a ﬁrm’s competitiveness. HPWP and the impact of HPWP on
performance are therefore supposed to vary between employee groups (Delery and
Shaw, 2001; Lepak and Snell, 1999).

Independent of the perspective put forward, the majority of empirical studies
on the HRM–performance link report a positive story about both the impact on
the individual and on the organization. Central to the mainstream models is the
idea that the adoption of HPWP helps to maximize employees’ affective reactions
at work (Peccei, 2004). This makes employees more satisﬁed, involved, committed
and/or  willing  to  work  hard. Consequently, they  actively  contribute  to  the  pro-
ductivity and overall effectiveness of the system. Although previous studies provide
evidence that this argumentation is valid, we argue that the outline of the costs
(both  social  and  ﬁnancial)  of
introducing  and  implementing  HPWP  has  been
neglected.

The Cost-Increasing Effect of HPWP

Concerning  the  impact  of HPWP  on  the  individual, the  majority  of authors
suggest that the introduction of HPWP predominantly has a positive effect on the
well being of employees (Appelbaum et al., 2000; Guest, 2002; Guest and King,
2004). Only recently, Ramsay et al. (2000) have shifted the focus and studied some
alternative  explanations  based  on  labour  process  theory. Whereas  mainstream
models point at positive employee outcomes (such as worker motivation, commit-
ment  and/or  satisfaction)  in  explaining  improved  performance, Ramsay  et  al.
(2000) consider negative employee outcomes (such as work intensiﬁcation, stress

323

and/or  job  strain)  to  account  for  productivity  gains. Their  analyses  partially
support this line of reasoning, consequently suggesting that conventional models
oversimplify the multiple ways in which HRM affects performance (Godard, 2001;
Ramsay et al., 2000).

Negative effects on employees might have ﬁnancial implications for organiza-
tions. Although work intensiﬁcation can increase productivity in the short term, it
might  be  a  potentially  cost-increasing  factor  in  the  long  term  (e.g. through  an
increase of absenteeism and/or turnover rates). Yet, mainstream models studying
the organizational level of analysis mainly concentrate on positive indirect or direct
ﬁrm performance enhancing effects (Delery and Doty, 1996; Huselid, 1995).

A  number  of studies  focused  on  productivity-related  performance  measures
(Ichniowski et al., 1997; MacDufﬁe, 1995). Cappelli and Neumark (2001) noted
rightly that this focus is too narrow because it does not include the costs associ-
ated  with  productivity  gains  and  the  balance  between  costs  and  gains. Other
studies concentrate on both (the mediating effect of) productivity and ﬁnancial or
market-related performance measures (e.g. Huselid, 1995). Although they can pro-
nounce upon the overall impact of HPWP, they do not reveal the whole picture
because they ignore potential cost-increasing mechanisms.

One could argue that cost-raising effects do not matter as long as the overall
ﬁnancial ﬁrm performance is positively inﬂuenced by the introduction of HPWP
(net  effect argument). Yet, there  are  several  reasons  for  unravelling  the  complex
network of costs and beneﬁts. First, from an economic point of view, assessments
of the cost-generating nature of HPWP – human (e.g. higher absenteeism through
stress) or non-human (e.g. the impact of a new training provider on the cost struc-
ture) – may reveal potential efﬁciency gains. Second, from a social point of view,
an insight in negative human effects might lead to better working conditions for
employees.

Three studies explicitly mention the cost-increasing effect of HPWP, although
it was not the main focus of the research. Cooke (1994) studied the moderating
effect  of union  representation  on  the  impact  of employee  participation  pro-
grammes  and  group-based  pay  on  ﬁrm  performance. The  author  described  in
detail performance gains and costs associated with both HPWP. He found that the
implementation of these practices increases wages, but not enough to neutralize
the positive effect on value added. Cappelli and Neumark (2001), in turn, found
that although HPWP may raise productivity slightly, they also raise labour costs.
To get insight in the overall impact, they measured the effect of HPWP on labour
efﬁciency (i.e. output per dollar spent on labour). They did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
effect (positive or negative). Finally, Way (2002) examined the impact of high per-
formance work systems (HPWS) on voluntary turnover and labour productivity in
US small businesses. The results show that HPWS are associated with lower vol-
untary turnover, but do not affect labour productivity (i.e. the natural logarithm
of ‘the  ﬁrm’s  total  sales, receipts  or  shipments/total  labour  costs’). The  author

concluded that ‘HPWS do not exceed (nor do they fail to meet) the labour costs
associated with the use of these systems’ (Way, 2002, p. 778).

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES

The Value-Enhancing Effect of HRM Intensity on Operational
Performance

A positive net effect on ﬁnancial ﬁrm performance can be caused by other (than
HR related) factors, e.g. management practices in other functional domains. Being
able to ascribe the positive net effect on ﬁnancial ﬁrm performance to HPWP, pre-
supposes evidence of a net effect on mediating operational performance measures
(such  as  productivity)  that  are  more  directly  inﬂuenced  by  HPWP  (Delery  and
Shaw, 2001). Therefore, we  include  productivity  in  our  conceptual  framework
(Figure 1).

We measure HRM by an HRM intensity index, reﬂecting a conﬁguration of best
practices in six HR domains (i.e. selection, training, careers, appraisal, compen-
sation and participation). The measures chosen (see section on measures for further
details) represent practices managing competencies and behaviours as well as empower-
ment practices (Delery and Shaw, 2001; Huselid, 1995; Wright and Snell, 1991).
We assume that each of the different HPWP has an independent direct effect
on productivity (Pfeffer, 1994). We discuss some examples (without being exhaus-
tive)  on  how  they  can  be  conceptually  linked  with  productivity. Selection  tech-
niques associated with high predictive validity can facilitate the detection of highly
productive  employees  and  the  optimization  of the  person–job–organization  ﬁt
(Schmidt and Hunter, 1998). Offering high wages and beneﬁts can improve pro-
ductivity by facilitating both the attraction and retention of a superior workforce

(Powell and Montgomery, 1994; Shaw et al., 1998). Based on learning theories the
use of performance related pay can be seen as a productivity enhancing mecha-
nism  steering  employees’ behaviour  into  the  desired  direction  (Lazear, 1996).
Finally, career lines can be mapped out in such a way that they produce a pro-
gressive improvement in KSAs the more rungs of the ladder are climbed, thereby
striving for an increase in both efﬁciency and productivity (Sels, 2002; Sels et al.,
2004). Given the above, the ﬁrst hypothesis is:

Hypothesis 1: HRM intensity has a direct positive effect on productivity.

In addition, we assume that HPWP can inﬂuence productivity indirectly, through
voluntary turnover. Based on empirical studies, we believe that HPWP are associ-
ated with lower levels of voluntary turnover (Arthur, 1994; Guthrie, 2001; Huselid,
1995; Shaw et al., 1998; Way, 2002). Training, for example, can enhance job sat-
isfaction or commitment and subsequently decrease turnover intention (Tett and
Meyer, 1993). Proﬁt sharing is particularly encouraged as an instrument for har-
monizing the interests of employees, management and shareholders and reinforces
corporate culture, company spirit and group cooperation (Shepard, 1994). These
factors  are  subsequently  expected  to  decrease  voluntary  turnover. Finally, forms 
of structural participation are associated with an enhancement of organizational
citizenship, job involvement and intensive cooperation (Cludts, 2002), ultimately
reducing  voluntary  turnover. Lower  levels  of turnover  can  subsequently  lead  to
higher organizational productivity (e.g. less disruption in the production or service
process).

Hypothesis 2: HRM intensity has an indirect positive effect on productivity by
lowering the voluntary employee turnover rate.

The Value-Enhancing Effect of HRM Intensity on Personnel Costs in
Value Added

The  choice  of performance  measures  is  rarely  adequately  substantiated  in
HRM–performance studies. Their appropriateness varies with the level of analy-
sis and the particular research setting (Becker and Gerhart, 1996). We opt for per-
formance measures reﬂecting survival chances instead of growth. We do so for two
reasons. First, given  the  higher  probability  of
failure  in  small  businesses  –  in
Belgium the likelihood of failure is three times as high compared to large com-
panies (i.e. more than 99 employees) (GRAYDON, 2001) – we believe continuity
to be a primary concern for most small businesses. In addition, we assume that
not every small company has the ambition or the desire to grow (Heneman et al.,
2000). The lack of necessary ﬁnancial or human resources proves to be an impor-

tant  growth  barrier  for  a  considerable  number  of small  businesses  (Binks  and
Ennew, 1996).

We deduce our small business ﬁnancial performance measures from bankruptcy
prediction models (Maes et al., 2005). These models assume that the progress of
four parameters must be monitored to obtain a sufﬁciently sound state of ﬁnan-
cial health: (1) the share of personnel costs in value added (PC/VA); (2) liquidity;
(3) solvency; and (4) proﬁtability. PC/VA is the crucial factor in revealing the rela-
tionship between HPWP and ﬁnancial performance.

Value added is the difference between total operating results and the costs of
the goods and services provided by third parties (external costs), which are neces-
sary  to  achieve  results. This  value  added  is  used  to  pay  for  internal  production
factors: labour (wages), the use of sustainable means of production (depreciation)
and capital (interest charges and proﬁt). A productivity increase caused by an inten-
sive HRM system (Hypotheses 1 and 2) implies that more value added is created
with the same number of worked hours. Since the personnel costs remain more
or less constant if the number of working hours is not changed, an increase in
productivity will lead to a decrease in PC/VA.

Hypothesis  3: HRM  intensity  indirectly  –  through  its  positive  impact  on  pro-
ductivity (cf. Hypotheses 1 and 2) – lowers PC/VA (the share of personnel costs
in value added).

The Cost-Raising Effect of HRM Intensity on PC/VA

The introduction or implementation of HPWP can generate direct and/or indi-
rect  costs. Direct  costs associated  with  HPWP  can  be  easily  allocated  and  are
reﬂected by changes in a ﬁrm’s internal or external cost structure. Recruiting an
HR ofﬁcer or introducing performance-related pay or non-statutory beneﬁts for
example directly increases personnel costs. Ceteris paribus, PC/VA will rise due
to this change in internal cost structure. Costs related with HR outsourcing activ-
ities  (e.g. outsourcing  of training  or  selection), are  displayed  by  changes  in  the
external cost structure. All things equal, a rise in supplier costs will be reﬂected by
a decrease in value added and subsequently by an increase of PC/VA.

Indirect costs can be less easily ascribed to one HPWP. They are displayed by pro-
ductivity or revenue losses rather than by changes in the cost structure. These losses
are reﬂected by a decrease in value added, thereby boosting PC/VA. Temporar-
ily  releasing  an  employee  from  his/her  tasks  in  order  to  execute  HR  related
(administrative) tasks or sending a worker to training does not directly lead to an
increase in personnel costs (except when he/she receives a once-only fee or a pay
increase following training participation). Still it may reduce value added because
the employee makes very little, if any, productive contribution for a certain time.
The  relaxation  of supervisory  monitoring  might  allow  some  employees  to  shirk

327

(Weitzman and Kruse, 1990). A higher absenteeism level will be translated in pro-
ductivity or revenue losses and subsequently in a decrease of value added. Finally,
the introduction of employee participation programmes can generate additional
transaction  costs  because  more  decision  makers  are  involved  in  workplace 
decisions  and  more  communication  is  required  between  participants  (Cooke,
1994). The time consuming effect of participation programmes generates indirect
costs.

These  direct  and  indirect  cost-increasing  effects  are  reﬂected  in  our  fourth
hypothesis. We believe that the implementation of HPWP will increase PC/VA;
directly, through a raise in personnel or external costs, or indirectly, through pro-
ductivity or revenue losses.

Hypothesis 4: HRM intensity directly increases PC/VA (the share of personnel
costs in value added).

The Overall Impact of HRM Intensity on Financial Performance

The ﬁrst aim of the article is to uncover both positive and negative relationships
between HRM intensity and ﬁrm performance. Our second purpose is to zoom
in on the total picture and evaluate how the combination of the value-enhancing
and  cost-increasing  effects  translates  in  ﬁnancial  performance. Whether  HRM
intensity  will  inﬂuence  ﬁnancial  performance  positively, negatively  or  not  at  all,
will depend upon the combination of the hypothesized relationships in Hypothe-
ses  3  and  4. As  mentioned  before, PC/VA  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  the  HRM–
performance link.

Next to PC/VA three other parameters are important in assessing a small busi-
ness’s  ﬁnancial  performance: (1)  proﬁtability; (2)  liquidity; and  (3)  solvency  (cf.
supra; Maes et al., 2005). Proﬁtability reﬂects ﬁnancial performance in the narrow
sense, in particular the company’s ability to yield a return on investment; a nec-
essary condition to attract ﬁnancial resources. Liquidity relates to the settlement of
short-term debts. A company will face ﬁnancial problems if the funds are not avail-
able to pay off these debts. In the case of small businesses striving for continuity,
liquidity is a very important indicator of the state of ﬁnancial health (‘a matter of
life  or  death’; Welsh  and  White, 1981, p. 29). Solvency indicates  the  ﬁnancial
strength of the company in the longer term and says something about the extent
to which the organization is equipped to face business risks. The higher the sol-
vency, the more substantial the buffer for difﬁcult times.

The lower PC/VA, the larger the margin to pay the ﬁnanciers, i.e. owner(s) or
shareholders (proﬁtability) and safeguard the ﬁnancial health of the ﬁrm in both the
short (liquidity) and the long term (solvency). To preserve the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial health,
PC/VA should not be excessively high. A maximum of 85 per cent is often sug-
gested (Maes et al., 2005).

The relationships between PC/VA and the three ﬁnancial performance indica-
tors  are  ‘true  by  deﬁnition’. Therefore, we  only  hypothesized  the  link  between
HRM intensity and PC/VA. However, in order to pronounce upon the ultimate
impact  of an  intensive  HRM  system  on  ﬁnancial  performance  we  have  to  take
these measures into account.

Following  Lepak  and  Snell  (1999), one  could  argue  that  (the  strength  of)  the
relationship  between  HRM  intensity  and  ﬁnancial  performance  may  differ
between employee groups depending on their value for the core competence of
the business. However, the distinction between core and non-core employees seems
less appropriate in a small business context. One can assume that the impact of
an individual’s action(s) on ﬁrm performance in small ﬁrms is larger than in a large
company, because fewer external factors are mediating this relationship (Gatewood
and Feild, 1987; Muse et al., 2005). In this sense, all employees are core workers
in small businesses.

RESEARCH DESIGN

Sample

The data we use for the analyses come from a survey of organizations with 10 to
100  employees. Companies  were  selected  from  the  BELFIRST  data  ﬁle  (see
Appendix). This ﬁle covers the population of ﬁrms in Belgium and contains infor-
mation from certiﬁed ﬁnancial statements. This enabled us to add ﬁnancial and
productivity data to the survey results. Both measures of performance relate to the
unit of analysis, which is not always the case with ﬁnancial or accounting mea-
sures (Cappelli and Neumark, 2001).

An economy-wide and stratiﬁed random sample was chosen for the survey, with
age and size as stratiﬁcation variables. As far as age is concerned, a distinction was
drawn  between  companies  existing  1  to  5  years, 6  to  10  years  and  11  years  or
more. Three  strata  of company  size  were  identiﬁed: 10–19, 20–49  and  50–99
employees.

Most HRM studies use the HR manager as the respondent. In this survey, the
business manager was targeted as respondent. The simple management structure
of a small business implies that the business manager often has a clear view on
the  various  management  practices  in  the  organization. This  partly  explains  the
high item response in this study. The reliability of a single informant method is
often said to be low (Gerhart, 1999; Gerhart et al., 2000). However, the problem
may be not as signiﬁcant in small businesses, as there may only be one (or a small
number of) individual(s) responsible for the entire HRM for all employees (Delery
and  Shaw, 2001). Moreover, small  businesses  usually  have  only  one  or  few  geo-
graphic sites and less diversity in HPWP (Datta et al., 2005; Huselid and Becker,
2000).

The questionnaires were distributed by mail, with intensive telephone follow-
up. This produced a total of 416 units (28 per cent response). To investigate prob-
lems involving self-selection and sample bias, the response and non-response were
compared  at  various  ratios, including  value  added, proﬁtability, solvency  and 
liquidity. No signiﬁcant differences were noted between the two groups.

Measures

HRM  intensity. The  Harvard  model  developed  by  Beer  et  al. (1984)  guides  the
process of HR domain identiﬁcation. We conﬁne ourselves to six functional HR
domains, each representing one of the central ‘Harvard policy areas’:

• HR ﬂows: (1) selection; (2) training; (3) careers.
• Rewards: (4) appraisal; (5) compensation.
• Employee inﬂuence: (6) participation.

In accordance with previous work (Delery and Shaw, 2001; Huselid, 1995; Wright
and  Snell, 1991), we  have  chosen  to  introduce  practices  managing  competencies
(KSAs  –  cf. HR  ﬂows), behaviours (cf. rewards)  and  empowerment practices  (cf.
employee inﬂuence) (Table I). Whereas in most studies the HR domains listed are
only indicated by one practice, we have chosen to select three HPWP per domain.
Each practice is constructed by means of a binary variable, where 0 indicates the
absence and 1 the presence of the practice. Doing so, we are able to capture a
wide variety of HPWP. Apart from variety, we are also concerned with the ques-
tion how thoroughly (intensively) the HRM is elaborated in the ﬁrm. Relying upon
a study of Chadwick (2000), stating that an additive index is most likely to accu-
rately capture the inﬂuence of HR systems on ﬁrm performance, we combined
the 18 practices into one index: the HRM intensity index. This index reﬂects a con-
ﬁguration  of best  practices, assuming  that  each  of the  different  HPWP  has  an
independent effect on performance (Pfeffer, 1994). Based on the index score, orga-
nizations may range from those making no use of the selected HPWP (score 0) 
to  those  using  all  of the  practices  (score  18). This  modus  operandi  puts  HRM
intensity  in  a  central  position  and  leaves  room  for  gradual  differences  among 
organizations.

Performance measures. The voluntary turnover rate is measured by the number of depar-
tures at employees’ initiative in proportion to the average number of staff in 1999.
As an indicator for labour productivity we use value added per working hour in 1999.
We opt for this variable instead of sales per employee, because value added is less
cost sensitive than sales (Cooke, 1994). Moreover, by using working hours instead
of the number of employees, we control for the actual working hours and thus the
presence of part-time workers.

Unravelling the HRM–Performance Link

Contrary to the measures of HPWP, voluntary turnover and productivity, the
ﬁnancial performance measures refer to 2000. Building in this time lag (together
with the control for past performance, cf. infra, section on control variables), we
partially counter the causality problem. The ﬁrst ﬁnancial performance indicator
is the share of personnel costs in value added. Personnel costs entail all costs of the work-
force employed on a temporary or permanent basis. These costs encompass wages,
social security taxes and beneﬁts. Value added is measured by ﬁrm revenues minus
the sum of subsidies, costs of commodities, raw materials and auxiliary materials
and costs of services and diverse goods. The ratio used for proﬁtability is the net
proﬁtability of the capital and reserves. This ratio compares proﬁt (after interest
payment) with the capital and reserves and therefore indicates the proﬁtability for
shareholders or owners. We selected the acid test or quick ratio as an indicator of
liquidity. This ratio indicates liquidity in the narrow sense, excluding the value of
stocks (which is important in a multiple sector setting) (Elliott and Elliott, 2002).
Only the assets which can be quickly converted into cash are set against the debts
of at most one year. In this sense, the ratio produces a picture of the extent to
which a company can redeem short-term debts, using immediately available funds,
without having to make use of external funds (loans) or reserves. A ratio that func-
tions as an indicator of solvency is the degree of auto-ﬁnancing. This ratio points
out the relationship between reserves and results carried over on the one hand (the
numerator) and total assets on the other hand (the denominator).

Control variables. Five control variables were included in the analyses. Because of
potential industry differences in productivity, we controlled for sector. Dummy codes
representing  four  broad  industry  categories  were  created: construction  sector,
industrial sectors, service sectors, trade sectors. Dummy coding is necessary when
bringing in nominal variables in path analysis (Hatcher, 1994). The construction
sector was used as our point of reference. We introduced the variable capital inten-
sity in order to control for possible discrepancies in productivity between labour
intensive and capital intensive companies (Datta et al., 2005). This variable is mea-
sured  by  the  value  of the  ﬁxed  material  equipment  divided  by  the  number  of
employees. Although  we  only  focus  on  small  businesses, we  included  ﬁrm  size
(number of employees) as a control variable. The use of HPWP as well as the level
of turnover  and  productivity  may  differ  between  companies  with  10  employees
and those with 99 employees. As Guthrie (2001) explained, the likeliness to use
HPWP  may  increase  with  company  size. Their  greater  internal  labour  market
opportunities may lead to lower levels of voluntary turnover. The age (number of
years since start-up) was included to control for the time available for elaborating
HPWP or for learning curve advantages in productivity (Guthrie, 2001; Harel and
Tzafrir, 1999). Finally, we introduced past performance (i.e. net proﬁtability of capital
and reserves in 1998). After all, HPWP can be self-reinforcing (Miles and Snow,
1984). If a particular practice leads to higher proﬁtability, then this proﬁtability

might encourage the containment or further development of this practice, or even
the introduction of new practices (Maes et al., 2005).

ANALYSES AND RESULTS

Descriptive Statistics

Table II gives an overview of the most important descriptive statistics. The average
score for HRM intensity is 7.21 on a maximum of 18. This means that the average
small business does not even use half of the HPWP examined. Way (2002) comes
to  a  similar  conclusion. Although  he  measures  other  HPWP, the  mean  HPWS
unitary index score is 2.61 out of a possible score of 7. We see that HRM inten-
sity is positively correlated with productivity and proﬁtability and negatively related
to voluntary turnover. The correlations with productivity and proﬁtability prove
to be signiﬁcant; the correlation with voluntary turnover does not. HRM intensity
and the share of personnel costs in value added do not correlate. At ﬁrst sight,
these correlations underpin the positive stories on the HRM–performance link.

To test the hypotheses, we used structural equation modelling (SEM) with man-
ifest variables. Compared to ordinary linear regression models, this technique has
two advantages. First and foremost, the method enables to deﬁne and test hypoth-
esized relationships between different variables. The output indicates whether the
model  is  supported  by  the  data  as  a  whole  and  gives  a  signiﬁcance  test  for  the
various individual relationships. Secondly, a variable in a SEM model can be either
dependent or independent. This allows testing the mediating inﬂuence, if any, of
certain variables. The SEM model of Figure 1 is tested using the CALIS proce-
dure (SAS). In evaluating this theoretical model, we considered four goodness-of-
ﬁt measures (Hatcher, 1994).

The goodness-of-ﬁt overview (Table III) indicates that the theoretical model is
not adequately supported by the data. An extra path between HRM intensity and
proﬁtability had to be added in order to optimize the model. This relationship can
be  accounted  for  theoretically  and  enriches  the  further  discussion  of
the
HRM–performance link (cf. infra).

The  optimized  model  is  short  of residual  values  that  signiﬁcantly  differ  from
zero. The goodness-of-ﬁt measures (Table III) indicate that the optimized model
is  effectively  supported  by  the  data. Below  we  interpret  and  explain  the  effects.
First, we look at the impact of HRM intensity on intermediate variables such as
productivity and voluntary turnover. Second, we elaborate on the effect of HRM
intensity on PC/VA. Third, we evaluate how the combination of both relation-
ships leads up to overall ﬁnancial performance. The standardized path coefﬁcients
are listed in Table IV. The results of the test of the optimized model are also rep-
resented  in  Figure  2. The  control  variables  have  been  omitted  in  this  graphical
representation in order not to overload the ﬁgure.

The Value-Enhancing Effect of HRM Intensity on 
Operational Performance

Table IV illustrates HRM intensity to have a positive and signiﬁcant impact on
productivity. Thus, Hypothesis 1 is supported. Hypothesis 2 is only partially sup-
ported. The negative effect of voluntary turnover on productivity is signiﬁcant and
matches our expectations. Contrary to the conclusion of Way (2002), the results
show no impact of HRM intensity on voluntary turnover. This lack of effect might
be due to the labour market situation at the time of the survey. The extreme short-
age of qualiﬁed staff gave rise to high labour mobility. Possibly, this shortage was
so  extreme  that  retention  efforts  produced  hardly  any  results, especially  not  in
smaller companies which may not always be able to compete with the terms of
employment of the major players (Cardon and Stevens, 2004). The pull factors
(tempting signals from larger and/or older companies) could have been so strong
that investment in retention-oriented HRM was not recouped by lower voluntary
turnover.

The Value-Enhancing and Cost-Increasing Effects of HRM Intensity
on PC/VA

Higher productivity implies that more value added is generated, given the same
number of working hours. Since personnel costs remain (approximately) constant
for the same number of working hours, a rise in productivity will mean a fall in
PC/VA. This  explains  the  strong  negative  relation  between  the  two  variables
(Table IV). However, this line of reasoning – which is consistent with Hypothesis
3 – only forms part of the total picture. In addition to this indirect link between
HRM intensity and PC/VA (via productivity), we also observe a direct link. The
more  HPWP  are  introduced, the  greater  the  share  of personnel  costs  in  value
added. This is in line with Hypothesis 4.

The Overall Impact of HRM Intensity on Financial Performance

Similar to the results of Cappelli and Neumark (2001) and Way (2002), the cost-
increasing effect is so strong that it completely cancels out the previously described
productivity gains. This is indicated in Table V, containing the direct, indirect and
total effects of HRM intensity on voluntary turnover, productivity and ﬁnancial
performance. If we calculate the total effect of HRM intensity on PC/VA – this
is  the  combination  of the  positive  direct  and  the  negative  indirect  effects  –  we
achieve an effect of approximately 0.06. HRM critics will refer to a zero sum game.
After  all, the  cost-increasing  effect  of
intensive  HRM  not  only  cancels  out  the

Notes:
(*) Indirect effects are calculated through a combination of summoning and multiplying direct effects. The indi-
rect effect of HRM intensity on productivity is the product of the negative direct effect of HRM intensity on
voluntary turnover (−0.04) and the negative direct effect of voluntary turnover on productivity (see Table IV;
−0.14): (−0.04) × (−0.14) = 0.0056 (or 0.01). The calculation of the indirect effect of HRM intensity on PC/VA
is more complex: [[(−0.04) × (−0.14)] + 0.10] × (−0.33) = −0.03.
(**) Total effect = direct effect + indirect effect.

productivity gains mentioned earlier, but at the same time affects important ﬁnan-
cial parameters such as proﬁtability, liquidity and solvency. Table V shows that the
total effects of HRM intensity on liquidity and solvency are indeed very close to
zero (both effects equal −0.02). The same goes for proﬁtability if we do not take
the direct effect of HRM intensity into account. The indirect effect adds up to 
−0.02.

The previous results suggest that there is no return on investment in HPWP for
smaller organizations. However, the ﬁnal evaluation turns out to be positive once
we take the direct effect of HRM intensity on proﬁtability into account. In addi-
tion to the already mentioned indirect effect of HRM intensity on proﬁtability (via
productivity and PC/VA) we also observe a direct effect (Table IV; Figure 2). This
effect had to be added during the analysis while optimizing the model.

This direct effect means that an intensive HRM system does not only inﬂuence
proﬁtability  through  increasing  productivity. The  deployment  of HPWP  also
affects proﬁtability in other ways. We can assume that this direct relationship is a
combined representation of all HRM effects that are not expressed via produc-
tivity and/or value added. After all, productivity is only one operational perfor-
mance  outcome  that  can  be  inﬂuenced  by  HRM. Other  operational  outcomes
include, for example, the innovation rhythm, the quality of the product or service
obtained, customer satisfaction, lead time, on-time delivery and so on (Peccei and
Rosenthal, 2001). In this sense, the explanatory model, only focusing on voluntary
turnover and productivity, remains incomplete. It is a complex process to develop
criteria for a cross-sector survey which enable the standardized measurement of
all  operational  performance  measures  mentioned. The  social  climate  or  the
number  of conﬂicts  is  also  left  out, even  though  previous  research  has  demon-
strated the relevance of these types of effects (Katz et al., 1985). The direct effect

on  proﬁtability  therefore  represents  a  combination  of effects  that  are  produced
through non-measured operational performance outcomes.

A recent study in young (i.e. juridical entity is 1 year old) and small (<50 employ-
ees)  Belgian  ﬁrms  points  in  this  direction  (Maes  and  Sels, 2004). The  authors
develop a similar HRM intensity index and studied its effect on innovation (mea-
sured by a scale from 0 to 8 depending upon the innovation intensity). The results
are  controlled  for  the  management  professionalism  in  other  functional  domains
such as marketing, ﬁnance, etc. and the number of years since the company was
founded. Even in the presence of these control variables, they ﬁnd an effect of an
intensive HRM on the extent to which ﬁrms are innovative.

We learn from Table V that if we integrate both the direct and indirect effects
(via productivity and PC/VA) on proﬁtability we end up with a strong and posi-
tive total effect of HRM intensity on proﬁtability. The total effect amounts to 0.14,
which  indicates  that  for  every  unit  of increase  on  the  HRM  intensity  scale, we
obtain an average increase in proﬁtability of about 14 per cent.

DISCUSSION AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

We  demonstrated  that  an  intensive  HRM  can  inﬂuence  the  ﬁnancial  health  of
small ﬁrms both positively and negatively. The cost-increasing impact cancels out
the productivity gains (zero sum game). However, despite the lack of effect on the
share of personnel costs in value added, we did ﬁnd a positive total effect on prof-
itability. Moreover, this positive impact of HRM intensity on proﬁtability is not at
the expense of a deteriorated solvency and liquidity score. This implies that we
cannot conclude that HPWP do not offer surplus value for smaller organizations.
Although we need some further investigation into the link between HRM and prof-
itability, this positive relationship is in line with prior empirical work on this topic
in larger companies.

We  theoretically  contribute  to  the  research  ﬁeld  by  unravelling  the  complex
network of interrelated positive (i.e. value-creating) and negative (i.e. cost-increas-
ing) effects of HPWP on ﬁrm performance. This attempt counters the neglect of
potential  cost-raising  effects  in  HRM–performance  research. More  complex
models of this kind could drive theory on the HRM–performance black box in
the future.

The ﬁndings should however be interpreted bearing their limitations in mind.
They  may  be  at  the  basis  of further  research. First, although  we  conclude  that
HRM intensity has a major effect on the proﬁtability of small businesses, we are
aware of the fact that other interpretations of this effect can emerge.

There are three necessary conditions that should be fulﬁlled to detect causality
between two variables: (1) correlation between cause and effect; (2) temporal prece-
dence  of the  cause; and  (3)  alternative  explanations  should  be  ruled  out  (Schu-
macker and Lomax, 2004). Especially the third condition is playing tricks on us.

Despite the introduction of different control variables, we can not rule out alter-
native explanations.

It is possible that an intensive HRM is a proxy for management professional-
ism in other functional domains in the company. In our study, we did not take the
possible simultaneity with activities in other policy areas (such as the marketing or
ﬁnancial  department)  into  account. The  squared  multiple  correlations  of our
model – comparable to the R square in linear regression models – show however
that these domains could have a substantial impact as well. Only 17 per cent of
total variance in productivity can be accounted for by the model, 23 per cent with
regard  to  proﬁtability. The  aforementioned  study  in  young  and  small  ﬁrms
however did not point in this direction (Maes and Sels, 2004). Despite controlling
for management professionalism in other functional domains, the authors found
a positive impact of HRM intensity on innovation.

Second, we only studied Belgian small businesses and are thus unable to pro-
nounce upon the extent to which these results are representative for smaller com-
panies in other countries.

Third, based  on  the  analysis  demonstrated, we  can  say  something  about  the
surplus value of HRM intensity in general terms. In this context, we do not yet
know  whether  some  individual  practices  have  stronger  effects  than  others, how
each of the individual practices affects performance, whether complementarities
or  synergistic  interdependent  relationships  (‘powerful  connections’)  among  such
practices  can  further  enhance  ﬁrm  performance  (Delaney  and  Huselid, 1996;
Delery, 1998).

Fourth, we lack indicators of business strategy. We examined the effect, in all
organizations, of an identical set of HPWP and did not look – as is the case in a
contingency perspective – at the vertical ﬁt between HRM and business strategy.
Including  contingencies, such  as  strategy, can  enhance  our  insights  in  the
HRM–performance  link  within  smaller  companies. We  are, in  the  ﬁrst  place,
thinking not only of research into compatibility with strategic choices, but also of
analyses that enable a coupling between HRM and life cycle models. In models
such  as  that  of Churchill  and  Lewis  (1983), it  is  assumed  that  organizations
progress through different stages of life (conception, survival, growth, expansion,
maturity) and that the intensity and nature of the contribution to the chance of
survival made by various functional business domains ﬂuctuates depending on the
stage (Kazanjian, 1988; Milliman et al., 1991). Further research should investigate
whether HPWP create surplus value at each stage of life and which practices or
bundles ﬁt in with certain stages of development.

APPENDIX: THE SYSTEM OF ANNUAL ACCOUNTS IN BELGIUM
AND THE BELFIRST DATABASE

The majority of Belgian ﬁrms are legally obliged to deposit an annual account,
which has been certiﬁed by an independent company reviser. An annual account
consists in four parts: (1) the balance sheet: a statement of the assets and liabilities of
the company; (2) the income statement: a reﬂection of the state of expenses and income
during the previous period; (3) the notes: further details about the balance sheet and
the proﬁt and loss account; and (4) the social balance sheet: data about employment
and training in the company.

The companies are legally bound to ﬁle their annual accounts at the Central
Balance Sheet Ofﬁce in order to provide third parties with reliable information on
their ﬁnancial health, employment and development during the past year. The role
of
the  Central  Balance  Sheet  Ofﬁce  consists  in  gathering  and  handling  these
accounts. In cooperation with a commercial ofﬁce (Van Dijck), the Central Balance
Sheet Ofﬁce puts these data at the disposal of any interested person or institution.
BELFIRST  is  such  an  electronic  database  delivered  by  the  ofﬁce  Van  Dijck,
containing the aforementioned ﬁnancial information on 304,000 Belgian compa-
nies and summary reports for a further 700,000 Belgian businesses. This database
includes contact information, data on the ownership, top management and sub-
sidiaries  of
turnover,
proﬁts/losses, etc) and 105 ﬁnancial ratios (e.g. acid ratio, value added/equity, etc).
As the ﬁrms in our study are all legally obliged to deposit an account, all of these
variables  were  available. Summary  reports  for  the  smaller  entities  include  less
detailed information.

the  company, ﬁrm  activities, 180  ﬁnancial  items  (e.g.

In this study, we merged our database on HPWP and voluntary turnover with
the BELFIRST database, containing the measures on productivity and ﬁnancial
performance  (i.e. PC/VA,
liquidity, solvency  and  proﬁtability). We  used  the
BELFIRST data that reﬂect the ﬁnancial state of the company at the end of the
year before (1998) and following on (2000) the year in which the survey on HPWP
in Belgian small ﬁrms was organised (1999).
