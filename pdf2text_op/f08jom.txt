 Customer Participation and the
 Trade-Off Between New Product

 Innovativeness and Speed to Market

 To address the trade-off between new product innovativeness and speed to market caused by customer
 participation activities, the author differentiates two dimensions of customer participation-customer participation
 as an information resource (CPI) and customer participation as a codeveloper (CPC)-and explores the
 moderating effects of downstream customer network connectivity and new product development process
 interdependence and complexity. Matched data collected from 143 customer-component manufacturer dyads
 indicate that CPI has a negative influence on innovativeness when downstream customer network connectivity is
 high but a positive effect when it is low. In contrast, CPI has a positive effect on speed to market when downstream
 customer network connectivity is high and no significant effect when it is low. In addition, CPC undermines new
 product speed to market when process interdependence is high. In contrast, CPC can improve new product speed
 to market but hurt new product innovativeness when process interdependence is low. The results of this article
 provide specific managerial guidelines as to how to manage customer participation to improve new product
 innovativeness and speed to market.

 Asignificant recent change in business markets has

 been the increasing involvement of industrial cus-
 tomers in manufacturers' new product development
 (NPD) processes (e.g., Bonner and Walker 2004; Kristens-
 son, Gustafsson, and Archer 2004). As Prahalad and
 Ramaswamy (2000, p. 80) state, in business markets, "cus-
 tomers are fundamentally changing the dynamics of the
 marketplace. The market has become a forum in which cus-
 tomers play an active role ... in [NPD]." With the use of
 customer participation, manufacturers attempt to enhance
 the innovativeness of the product and speed up the develop-
 ment process, both of which are key objectives whose
 importance has been well articulated by both practitioners
 and academicians (e.g., Athaide, Meyers, and Wilemon
 1996; Chandy and Tellis 1998; Henard and Szymanski
 2001). For example, Apple's recent success with the iPod is
 likely due to its simultaneous achievement of high innova-
 tiveness and a faster introduction than competitors (Fortune
 2006). However, customer participation may result in oppo-
 site effects on new product innovativeness and speed to
 market. Such opposite effects resulting from customer par-
 ticipation have been intuited by previous studies (e.g.,
 Crawford 1992; Foster 1986; Gaynor 1993; Zangwill 1993),
 but theoretical explorations remain scarce in marketing
 literature.

 The objective of this research is to answer the following
 overarching questions: Are there trade-offs associated with
 customer participation in NPD? Can customer participation
 undermine new product innovativeness and speed to mar-
 ket, even as it facilitates one but not the other? New product

 innovativeness refers to the extent to which the product dif-
 fers from competing alternatives in a way that is meaningful
 to customers and therefore reflects meaningful uniqueness
 (Dewar and Dutton 1986; Sethi, Smith, and Park 2001).
 Speed to market reflects the time elapsed between the initial
 development, which includes conception and definition, and
 the ultimate introduction of an innovation into the market-
 place (Griffin 1997). Specifically, the current research dif-
 ferentiates two dimensions of customer participation-cus-
 tomer participation as an information resource (CPI) and
 customer participation as a codeveloper (CPC)-and exam-
 ines their effects on new product innovativeness and speed
 to market. In doing so, several moderating factors are iden-
 tified that explain how customer participation can improve
 one outcome while undermining the other outcome.
 Hypotheses are empirically tested using primary data col-
 lected from 142 matched original equipment manufacturer
 (OEM) customer-component manufacturer dyads. As such,
 this article provides two major findings to answer the
 research questions. From a managerial standpoint, these
 findings provide specific guidelines on how to manage cus-
 tomer participation to improve new product innovativeness
 and speed to market.

 First, the trade-off between new product innovativeness
 and speed to market can be explained by the configuration
 of the industry network formed between the OEM cus-
 tomer's retailers and distributors. In some networks, these
 retailers and distributors are highly connected and maintain
 communication between each other, whereas the connectiv-
 ity of other networks is low, such that distributors and retail-
 ers do not maintain regular contacts between each other.
 This research finds that network connectivity between
 retailers and distributors (i.e., downstream customer net-
 work connectivity) heightens CPI's effect on speed to mar-

 ket, but it alleviates CPI's effect on product innovativeness.
 In particular, CPI has a negative influence on innovative-
 ness when downstream customer network connectivity is
 high but a positive effect when it is low. In contrast, CPI has
 a positive effect on speed to market when downstream cus-
 tomer network connectivity is high and no significant effect
 when it is low.

 Second, NPD projects may vary in terms of the com-
 plexity of the development processes (process complexity)
 and whether completing development tasks requires inter-
 actions between the component manufacturer and the OEM
 customer during the various development stages (process
 interdependence). The results suggest that because of the
 different coordination mechanisms entailed by different lev-
 els of process interdependence, CPC undermines new prod-
 uct speed to market when process interdependence is high.
 In contrast, CPC can improve new product speed to market
 but hurt new product innovativeness when process inter-
 dependence is low.

 The remainder of this article proceeds as follows: First,
 a theoretical framework is advanced to explore the dimen-
 sions of customer participation and their effects on new
 product innovativeness and speed to market. Within the
 framework, the issues of how downstream customer net-
 work connectivity, process complexity, and interdependence
 may moderate such effects are addressed. Second, the
 empirical context and the data collection procedures are
 described, followed by the data analysis and results. Finally,
 the theoretical and empirical implications are discussed, as
 well as limitations and future research directions.

 Theoretical Framework

 Customer Participation
 "Customer participation" is defined as the extent to which
 the customer is involved in the manufacturer's NPD
 process. The specific context of this research is an OEM
 customer's (e.g., Ford) involvement in its component manu-
 facturer's (e.g., auto engine manufacturer) new component
 development process. Previous studies have demonstrated
 that customers may assume two distinct roles: information
 providers or codevelopers (e.g., Lengnick-Hall 1996).
 Therefore, we delineate customer participation along two
 specific dimensions: CPI and CPC.

 The former dimension involves activities such as shar-

 ing information with the manufacturer during the NPD
 process. In particular, demand information about the OEM
 customer's distributors and retailers is critical in this con-
 text because new product success depends on their accep-
 tance of the new product (Luo, Kannan, and Ratchford
 2006), and the information they own in areas such as end-
 consumer needs and potential competitive reactions can
 greatly affect !Jew product innovativeness and speed to mar-
 ket (Joshi and Sharma 2004). In this sense, OEM customers
 serve as "bridges" between retailers/distributors and com-
 ponent manufacturers that transfer market information into
 the component development process; this bridge is particu-
 larly significant in industrial markets in which component
 manufacturers lack easy access to information about retail-
 ers and distributors. Von Hippel's (1988) "lead user" con-

 cept fits this dimension of customer participation, in that it
 identifies OEM manufacturers that can recognize the mar-
 ket information that is critical for innovation and speed to
 market from distributors and retailers.

 In contrast, CPC refers to the extent to which the OEM
 customer's task involvement constitutes a significant por-
 tion of the development tasks. When the OEM customer is
 involved in the component development process, the overall
 NPD process becomes a joint problem-solving approach,
 the outcome of which is determined by the mechanisms
 used to coordinate the OEM customer and component
 manufacturer (Gerwin 2004). Despite the potential benefits
 of CPC, such as introducing customer expertise into the
 process, significant coordination challenges exist for incor-
 porating OEM customer efforts effectively and efficiently
 (Carlile and Rebentisch 2003; Von Hippel 1990). In addi-
 tion, CPC can take various forms. For example, the compo-
 nent manufacturer and OEM customer might work sepa-
 rately and dominate different stages, or they could form a
 joint NPD team and work cooperatively throughout the
 development process. The next subsection discusses how
 CPI and CPC affect new product innovativeness and speed
 to market, as well as how these effects may be moderated
 by the network properties of distributors and retailers and
 the characteristics of the development process.

 CPI's Effect on New Product Innovativeness and
 Speed to Market
 A critical advantage when OEM customers participate in
 the NPD process is the better access to market information
 because OEM customers engage in direct interactions with
 retailers and distributors. However, the type of market infor-
 mation and how quickly the OEM customer can access this
 information depend on the relationships between distribu-
 tors and retailers. Relationship marketing literature suggests
 that connections in dyadic business relationships can signif-
 icantly influence the information exchange between firms
 (Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh 1987). Social network theory takes
 this idea one step further by arguing that to "capture the
 embedded context within which dyadic business relation-
 ships occur," researchers must examine the "broader context
 of connected relationships" (Anderson, Hakansson, and
 Johanson 1994, p. 7). Specifically, market information
 accessed by OEM customers results from interactions
 between distributors and retailers that are connected as a
 network (Von Hippel 1988). As Uzzi (1996, p. 675) sug-
 gests, the "connectivity of [the] network in which firms are
 embedded defines the information exchange among them."
 Therefore, this research focuses on an important aspect
 of the network formed between these distributors and retail-
 ers-namely, downstream network connectivity, which is
 defined as the extent to which the distributors and retailers
 (i.e., downstream customers) in the OEM customer's net-
 work are connected directly instead of through a common
 third party (Ahuja 2000).1 For example, network connectiv-
 ity is higher if downstream customer A knows B and C and

 1"Network connectivity" also has been referred to as "network
 closure"; these two terms may be used interchangeably (Burt
 2001; Coleman 1988).

 if B also knows C than if B and C connect to each other
 only through A. Perfect connectivity means that everyone in
 the network knows and communicates with one another
 directly, instead of through a common third party.

 Low network connectivity makes firms less limited to

 the local knowledge occupied by their direct connections
 (Granovetter 1983), such that "[a] diverse and disconnected
 network exposes the individual to conflicting and diverse
 preferences" (Podolny and Baron 1997, p. 676). In support
 of this argument, Uzzi (1999) finds that in the banking
 industry, low network connectivity facilitates firm access to
 diverse information about the marketplace. This diverse
 market information from retailers and distributors can help
 the development team identify which marketing trends and
 opportunities to pursue, what the appropriate product attrib-
 utes should be, and what the product concept will be (Grif-
 fin and Hauser 1993). That is, when the development team
 considers a broad range of market information and uses it to
 generate ideas and opinions about the product concept,
 innovativeness likely increases (Amabile 1983). In contrast,
 market information transferred under high network connec-
 tivity likely flows in closed circles, which prevents a broad
 vision or exploration of external information (Mumford and
 Gustafson 1988). As a result, this cognitive "lock-in"
 between distributors and retailers in a highly connected net-
 work leads to a more homogeneous market information
 base (Gargiulo and Benassi 2000), which can harm new
 product innovativeness (Rindfleisch and Moorman 2001).
 Homogeneous market information limits the process of
 identifying problems, using guesswork, developing alterna-
 tive hypotheses, and contradicting expectations (Torrance
 1988), and it further distracts NPD teams from their pursuit
 of innovativeness by emphasizing homogeneous customer
 needs and preferences (Amabile 1996). As Prabhu, Chandy,
 and Ellis (2005, p. 116) indicate, "[w]ith changes in market
 preferences and technological opportunities, knowledge
 that was once a source of competitive advantage may
 become irrelevant. Low diversity makes the firm especially
 vulnerable.... Broader knowledge, however, gives the firm
 greater flexibility and adaptability in responding to environ-
 mental change ... the broader a firm's knowledge, the
 greater is its ability to create innovations."

 However, downstream network connectivity also may

 enhance the effect of CPI on new product innovativeness.2
 From a structural standpoint, the lack of connections
 between distributors and retailers may lead to information
 loss during the transfer process (Podolny and Page 1998).
 For example, market information owned by certain distribu-
 tors and retailers may not reach OEM customers if they lack
 connections with other network participants. From a moti-
 vational standpoint, Larson (1992) reports that "thicker
 information" transfers between retailers and distributors in
 highly connected networks because these firms do not self-
 ishly pursue immediate gains but rather concentrate on cul-
 tivating long-term, cooperative relationships. Specifically,
 in a highly connected network, trust builds, facilitating the
 sharing and integration of market information between dis-

 tributors and retailers (Tsai and Ghoshal 1998). This shar-
 ing and integration can lead to new market perspectives and
 insights, which in turn significantly improve new product
 innovativeness when introduced into the development
 process by the OEM customer. On the basis of these oppos-
 ing arguments, we suggest the following nondirectional
 hypothesis:

 Hia: Downstream customer network connectivity positively/
 negatively moderates the effect of CPI on new product
 innovativeness.

 Downstream customer network connectivity can also
 moderate the effect of CPI on new product speed to market.
 Because a development process involves constant adjust-
 ments in response to updated market information about end
 consumers, the participating OEM customer constantly
 must reach out to its downstream customers to gain updated
 market information and then share that knowledge with the
 component manufacturer (Ganesan, Malter, and Rindfleisch
 2005). With high network connectivity, distributors and
 retailers transfer market information more quickly because
 they know where the information is located and how to
 access it (Coleman 1988). They also are more likely to
 cooperate, in terms of providing information in a timely
 manner to the party that needs it, because any uncooperative
 behaviors (e.g., withholding information) would be passed
 on to other partners through connected networks, and so the
 uncooperative party would incur social pressures (Gulati
 1995). This rapid transfer of information between distribu-
 tors and retailers particularly helps improve NPD speed
 because the OEM customer demands evolving market infor-
 mation that does not pertain to one or few distributors and
 retailers but rather results from the transfer and integration
 of market information by all distributors and retailers in the
 network (Griffin and Hauser 1993).

 In addition, because of the regular communications
 between different distributors and retailers in a highly con-
 nected network, they can coordinate their market informa-
 tion collection and dissemination activities more effectively
 (Romo and Schwartz 1995), which validates market infor-
 mation and results in more accurate information transfer to
 the OEM customer (Kogut and Zander 1992). In turn, the
 accuracy of market information provided by the OEM cus-
 tomer helps the development team catch potential problems
 and incorporate major issues and concerns at the beginning
 of the design process, which minimizes downstream delays
 (Karagozoglu and Brown 1993; Smith and Reinertsen
 1991). Thus:

 Hib: Downstream customer network connectivity positively
 moderates the effect of CPI on new product speed to
 market.

 CPC's Effect on New Product Innovativeness and
 Speed to Market
 When customers function as codevelopers, CPC turns the
 development tasks into a joint problem-solving process
 (Gerwin 2004), in which the NPD process consists of a set
 of interrelated, specific tasks distributed between the OEM
 customer and the component manufacturer (Von Hippel
 1990). Two NPD process characteristics significantly influ-

 ence the choice of coordination procedures for joint
 problem-solving processes, which in turn influence the
 effects of CPC on new product innovativeness and speed to
 market (Sobrero and Roberts 2001). "Process inter-
 dependence" refers to the extent to which the completion of
 development tasks depends on interactions between the
 manufacturer and the customer during the development
 stages (Sobrero and Roberts 2001; Thompson 1967),
 whereas "process complexity" refers to the extent to which
 the development process is technically complicated and
 requires the involvement of a wide range of organizational
 functions (Griffin 1997).

 Process interdependence-when both the manufac-
 turer's and the customer's inputs are important for complet-
 ing each task-makes it difficult or even impossible to par-
 tition the development into consequent but interrelated
 steps, such that each party completes certain tasks (Von
 Hippel 1990). Thus, process interdependence creates a plat-
 form on which the manufacturer and customer can interact
 and learn from each other during each stage as the project
 progresses (Sobrero and Roberts 2001). The development
 team can challenge traditional perspectives and discover
 novel linkages in the development process (Milliken and
 Martins 1996; Osborn 1963) by connecting different design
 parameters that have not been linked before or by finding
 new ways to uncover creative elements (Amabile 1983),
 which can significantly enhance CPC's effect on new prod-
 uct innovativeness (Krishnan and Ulrich 2001; Sethi, Smith,
 and Park 2001). For example, Von Hippel (1990) argues that
 finding new ways to connect the design of a car's piston and
 engine cylinder could improve the innovativeness of auto
 engine designs. In contrast, with low process inter-
 dependence, the development team cannot identify novel
 ideas and linkages at the outset of the project, and the task
 partitioning may hamper interaction and learning opportu-
 nities, which makes the associated CPC less likely to lead to
 new product innovativeness (Carlile and Rebentisch 2003).
 Thus:

 H2a: Process interdependence positively moderates the effect

 of CPC on new product innovativeness.

 However, when the customer's effort constitutes a sig-
 nificant portion of the development tasks, the coordination
 burdens significantly increase because the customer's and
 manufacturer's divergent perspectives must be resolved
 before the development can move forward (Olson, Walker,
 and Ruekert 1995). Low process interdependence enables
 the manufacturer and customer to use task partitioning and
 take advantage of each party's knowledge and expertise in
 specific areas, which reduces the overall coordination load
 of the NPD project (Carlile and Rebentisch 2003). As
 Moorman and Miner (1998) suggest, new product speed to
 market largely depends on how quickly the development
 team handles coordination issues and problems in each
 development stage. Therefore, with low process inter-
 dependence, the manufacturer and customer work individu-
 ally on their specialized tasks, and there is no further need
 for articulated or frequent interactions to complete each
 task, which enhances CPC's effect on NPD speed signifi-
 cantly (Von Hippel 1990). Thus:

 H2b: Process interdependence negatively moderates the effect

 of CPC on new product speed to market.

 Process complexity requires the inclusion of multiple

 functions into the NPD process. When an OEM customer
 participates in the development process, this inclusion cre-
 ates more areas for interaction and facilitates the discovery
 of novel linkages during the codevelopment process (Mil-
 liken and Martins 1996). In addition, process complexity
 makes it more difficult to establish problem-solving rou-
 tines in advance because the project requires back-and-forth
 and trial-and-error procedures (Von Hippel 1990). This iter-
 ative process generates opportunities for the OEM customer
 and manufacturer to try alternative development procedures
 and routines to improve product innovativeness. In other
 words, when the process is more complex, gaining input
 from the OEM customer improves new product innovative-
 ness even further-particularly because complex processes
 often demand complex solutions. Involving the OEM cus-
 tomer may prevent the development team from following
 existing development paths, which helps it discover novel
 linkages during the process. Therefore, CPC should
 increase innovativeness more when process complexity is
 high than when it is low.

 H3a: Process complexity positively moderates the effect of

 CPC on new product innovativeness.

 In contrast, when the customer's effort as a codeveloper
 increases, the coordination requirement increases, espe-
 cially when the process involves a wide range of functions
 (Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2000). In addition, because of
 the greater interaction depth associated with CPC, speedy
 problem solving between the component manufacturer and
 the OEM customer becomes more difficult; the necessary
 back-and-forth and trial-and-error procedures preclude the
 possibility of structuring a formalized coordination mecha-
 nism to control the development process in a timely man-
 ner. Therefore, the difficulty of coordination, coupled with a
 high coordination burden, makes CPC less likely to speed
 up the development process when process complexity is
 high.

 H3b: Process complexity negatively moderates the effect of

 CPC on new product speed to market.

 Method

 Research Context

 This research tests the hypotheses with dyadic data col-
 lected from both OEM customers and component manufac-
 turers. Consistent with previous studies in business-to-
 business markets (e.g., Heide 2003), the focus here is on
 OEM customers in three broad, two-digit Standard Indus-
 trial Classification (SIC) groups: 35 (general machinery),
 36 (electrical and electronic machinery), and 37 (transporta-
 tion equipment). The unit of interest is a component manu-
 facturer's new component development project in which the
 OEM customer is involved. In addition, the term "down-
 stream customers" refers to distributors or retailers of the
 OEM customer's final product.

 Data Collection

 From the conceptual domain of each construct, data were
 collected from both OEM customers and component manu-
 facturers. The dependent variables (new product innovative-
 ness and new product speed to market) and two moderating
 variables (process interdependence and process complexity)
 came from respondents from component manufacturers,
 and the independent variables (CPI and CPC), downstream
 customer network connectivity, and control variables relied
 on respondents from OEM customers.

 OEM customers. For the survey of the OEM customers,
 a mailing list was procured from a commercial list broker;
 all incomplete addresses were removed to derive an initial
 sample of 2000 firms. The first stage of data collection
 included a mailed prescreening sent to the potential respon-
 dents to assess their appropriateness. Through a short pre-
 screening questionnaire, it was determined whether respon-
 dents had been involved in their component manufacturer's
 NPD process in the prior two years. Information about the
 respondents' job titles, number of years with the firm, and
 percentage of time spent on manufacturer-related activities
 was also collected. Of the 2000 firms, 525 prescreening
 responses were received. Of those respondents, 68 were
 eliminated because they were not involved in their manu-
 facturers' NPD process in the previous two years, had spent
 fewer than two years in their position, or bore titles that
 reflected a low-level position.

 Then, questionnaire packets were mailed to the remain-

 ing 457 managers. The survey instructions asked respon-
 dents to reflect on the most recent NPD project in which
 they had been involved and to complete the questionnaire
 with that project in mind. A follow-up mailing was sent two
 weeks later. In addition to the survey, each mailing included
 a prepaid return envelope and a cover letter. To increase sur-
 vey response rates, multiple mail contacts, first-class
 postage, prepaid return envelopes, and informative cover
 letters were used (Dillman 2000). This two-wave sampling
 effort generated 245 responses, but 3 were removed because
 they contained too many missing values (>5%).

 As Armstrong and Overton (1977) recommend, early
 and late responses were compared, but there was no indica-
 tion of response bias. The survey instrument also included
 post hoc checks of the informants' knowledge and involve-
 ment in the manufacturers' NPD processes. On a seven-
 point scale, the mean of their knowledge was 6.35, and the
 mean of their involvement was 6.13. Seven responses that
 indicated inadequate levels of informant knowledge and
 involvement were eliminated (i.e., scores of less than 4 on
 the seven-point scale). Thus, 235 usable responses were
 obtained, for a 51.2% effective response rate. The respon-
 dents represented job titles such as manufacturing man-
 agers, product managers, vice presidents of manufacturing,
 and so on. Considering the nature of the sample and results
 from previous studies, this level represents a reasonable sur-
 vey response.

 Component manufacturers. The questionnaires sent to

 the OEM customers also asked respondents to indicate con-
 tact information for managers of the component manufac-
 turers with which they had been working. Of the OEM

 respondents, 203 provided such information, and these
 identified managers were telephoned to solicit survey
 answers from them. Of these respondents, 145 senior man-
 agers from the manufacturers were successfully reached
 and surveyed, for a response rate of 71.4%. On a seven-
 point scale, the mean of their knowledge was 6.32, and the
 mean of their involvement was 6.01; two responses with
 inadequate levels of knowledge and involvement were
 eliminated (i.e., scores of less than 4 on a seven-point
 scale). The respondents were product managers, manufac-
 turing managers, project managers, vice presidents of
 research and development, vice presidents of manufactur-
 ing, and so forth.

 Thus, for the data analysis stage, there were 143

 matched observations from component manufacturer-OEM
 customer dyads. These 143 responses were compared with
 the remaining 92 responses from OEM customers only, and
 no significant mean differences were found for the con-
 structs reported by OEM customers. The focal new devel-
 opment projects varied across a broad range of categories,
 including computer peripheral devices, general industrial
 machinery and equipment, electronic components, and
 transportation components and parts.

 Measurements

 The questionnaires was developed using the procedures that
 Churchill (1979) and Gerbing and Anderson (1988) recom-
 mend. Initially, eight paired interviews were conducted with
 executives from both OEM customers and component
 manufacturers across the three SICs. These early inter-
 views, which lasted approximately ten hours, helped
 develop the measurement scales and were instrumental in
 the attempt to craft the pretest survey. On the basis of these
 interviews and an extensive review of previous studies, pre-
 liminary versions of the questionnaires were developed.
 When possible, existing scale items were adapted to the
 context. Subsequently, the questionnaires were mailed to a
 sample of ten OEM customers and ten component manufac-
 turers to verify the appropriateness of the terminology used
 and the clarity of the instructions. A total of 15 question-
 naires were returned, and they indicated that, in general, the
 survey instrument was sound, though a few items were
 modified for clarity. The measurement items appear in
 Appendixes A and B.

 New product innovativeness and speed to market. The
 measure of new product innovativeness, which uses a six-
 item, seven-point semantic differential scale, was adapted
 from Moorman's (1995) new product creativity scale. The
 scale items ask respondents about the extent to which the
 developed component is novel to the industry and offers
 new ideas. The coefficient alpha is .854. Measures adapted
 from the work of Griffin (1997) were used to measure new
 product speed to market. Specifically, a five-item, seven-
 point semantic differential scale asked respondents to rate
 the speed of development associated with the new compo-
 nent, resulting in a coefficient alpha of .809.

 CPI and CPC. As noted previously, CPI refers to the

 extent to which OEM customers share downstream cus-
 tomer information with the manufacturer during the NPD
 process. A new four-item, seven-point Likert scale was

 developed to measure this construct. The coefficient alpha
 is .821. In addition, CPC refers to the extent to which the
 OEM customer's task involvement constitutes a significant
 portion of the development task; three items that use a
 seven-point Likert scale were developed to measure this
 construct. The coefficient alpha is .798.

 Downstream customer network connectivity. On the
 basis of previous social network analysis studies (e.g., Antia
 and Frazier 2001; Wuyts and Geyskens 2005), downstream
 customer network connectivity was also measured through
 a primary survey. Specifically, a four-item, seven-point Lik-
 ert scale was developed to determine respondents' evalua-
 tions of the degree of connectivity between the OEM cus-
 tomer's distributors and retailers in terms of acquaintance,
 communication frequency, and involvement in professional
 associations. The coefficient alpha for this measure is .773.

 Process interdependence and process complexity. A
 newly developed four-item, seven-point Likert scale, with a
 coefficient alpha of .834, measured process inter-
 dependence by asking respondents about the extent to
 which the completion of each stage in the development
 process depends on the input and frequent collaboration of
 the manufacturer and OEM customer. Three items that use a
 seven-point semantic scale to measure process complexity
 were adapted from the work of Griffin (1997). Thus,
 respondents evaluated the extent to which the development
 process is complex and technical and spans a wide range of
 functions. The coefficient alpha is .723.

 Control Variables

 Several control variables were also included. At the project
 level, three variables were employed. Both marketing and
 technology resource inputs can significantly influence NPD
 success, particularly innovativeness and speed to market,
 depending on their level (Gatignon and Xuereb 1997).
 Thus, in line with the work of Vorhies and Morgan (2003),
 both constructs were measured with five-item, seven-point
 semantic scales that asked respondents about the level of
 marketing and technology resources the component manu-
 facturer and OEM customer put into the NPD process. The
 coefficient alpha for the marketing resource input is .834,
 and for the technology resource input, it is .871. In addition,
 product criticality, or the importance of the developed com-
 ponent to the overall functioning of the end product, was
 controlled for (Rangan, Menezes, and Maier 1992) and
 measured using three seven-point Likert scales developed
 for this study, with a coefficient alpha of .734.

 At the firm level, the firm size of both the OEM cus-
 tomer and the component manufacturer was controlled for
 and measured as the number of employees. To normalize
 size, a log-transformation was used. Downstream customer
 network size was also included and was measured by two
 new seven-point Likert scale items; this controlled for its
 possible effect on information sharing and, thus, new prod-
 uct innovativeness and speed to market. The coefficient
 alpha is .675. In addition, the downstream customers' rela-
 tive power over the OEM customer was controlled for and
 measured as the percentage of the OEM customer's sales
 through these downstream distributors and retailers (Frazier

 1983). Prior studies have suggested that this relative power
 could significantly affect information sharing between the
 OEM customer and its downstream customers and, thus,
 new product innovativeness and speed to market (e.g., Kohli
 1989).

 At the relationship level, relationship embeddedness
 and relationship history between the OEM customer and the
 component manufacturer were included. Both relationship
 history and relationship embeddedness, defined as "the
 degree of reciprocity and closeness" between the OEM cus-
 tomer and component manufacturer (Rindfleisch and Moor-
 man 2001, p. 3), can influence codevelopment outcomes.
 The measure of relationship history considers the number
 of years the OEM customer and component manufacturer
 have been doing business together, and relationship embed-
 dedness uses a four-item, seven-point Likert scale adapted
 from the work of Rindfleisch and Moorman (2001). The
 coefficient alpha is .812.

 At the environmental level, environmental dynamism

 was included because of its influence on NPD success
 (Gatignon and Xuereb 1997). This was measured with four
 seven-point Likert scales adapted from the work of
 Jaworski and Kohli (1993), with a coefficient alpha of .804.
 Industry was also controlled for with a set of dummy
 variables based on the two-digit SIC codes (industry
 dummy_l = 1 if two-digit code is 35 and 0 if not; industry
 dummy_2 = 1 if two-digit SIC code is 36 and 0 if not).

 Measurement Validation Procedure

 The unidimensionality and convergent validity of the con-
 structs were examined with confirmatory factor analysis
 (CFA) using LISREL. Separate CFAs were conducted for
 the OEM customer and component manufacturer data sets.
 As Appendixes A and B indicate, the CFA models suggest
 acceptable fit indexes for both samples. All items load on
 their respective constructs, and each loading is large and
 significant at the .01 level, showing satisfactory convergent
 validity (Anderson and Gerbing 1988). To assess the dis-
 criminant validity of the constructs, a CFA model that con-
 strained the correlation between a pair of constructs to 1
 was compared with an unconstrained CFA model. To indi-
 cate discriminant validity, the unconstrained model must fit
 significantly better than the constrained model (Bagozzi, Yi,
 and Phillips 1991). The pairwise chi-square difference tests
 indicate that in each case, the chi-square difference statistic
 is significant at the .01 level, in support of discriminant
 validity. In addition, all pairs of constructs pass Fornell and
 Larcker's (1981) test of discriminant validity. That is, the
 amount of variance extracted by each construct (when mea-
 surement error is taken into account) is greater than the
 squared correlation between the two constructs. Table 1 pre-
 sents the correlation matrix and descriptive statistics.

 Results

 Seemingly unrelated regression (SURE), which Zellner
 (1962) developed for estimating theoretically related sets of
 equations, was used to estimate the model (see Table 2).
 Because the error terms of the different equations related to
 new product innovativeness and speed to market can be cor-

 related, as can the independent variables, SURE is an
 appropriate estimation method (Zellner 1962). To test the
 moderating effects, both the independent and the moderat-
 ing variables were mean centered to reduce the potential
 problem of multicollinearity (Aiken and West 1991). In
 addition, the significant interactions were analyzed with
 simple slope analysis, a technique that overcomes the need
 to create subgroups of continuous independent variables
 (Aiken and West 1991). Simple slope analysis indicates
 whether the regressions of CPI and CPC on new product
 innovativeness and new product speed to market are posi-
 tive or negative at high and low levels of the moderators; the
 results appear in Figures 1 and 2.

 effect becomes positive (r3 = .325, p < .01). Hib, which pre-
 dicted that downstream customer network connectivity
 would positively moderate the effect of CPI on new product
 speed to market, also receives support, in that the inter-
 action term between downstream customer network connec-
 tivity and CPI has a significant, positive effect on new prod-
 uct speed to market (13 = .220, p < .05). As Figure 1, Panel
 B, shows, a simple slope analysis implies that when down-
 stream customer connectivity is high (one standard devia-
 tion above the mean), CPI has a significant, positive effect
 on speed to market (r3 = .472, p < .01) but no significant
 effect when downstream customer network connectivity is
 low (one standard deviation below the mean) ([3 = .023,
 n.s.).

 H2a and H2b are also supported. Specifically, Table 2

 Hia predicted that downstream customer network con-
 nectivity would moderate the effect of CPI on product inno-
 vativeness. As Table 2 indicates, the interaction term
 between downstream customer network connectivity and
 CPI demonstrates a significant, negative effect on new
 product innovativeness .05). The results of
 simple slope analysis in Figure 1, Panel A, provide more
 insight into this moderating effect. When downstream cus-
 tomer network connectivity is high (one standard deviation
 above the mean), CPI has a significant, negative effect on
 product innovativeness (13 = -.151, p < .05); when connec-
 tivity is low (one standard deviation below the mean), this

 shows that process interdependence positively moderates
 the effect of CPC on new product innovativeness with a sig-
 nificant coefficient ([3 = .153, p < .05). The simple slope
 analysis also shows that when process interdependence is
 high (one standard deviation above the mean), the effect of
 CPC on new product innovativeness is not significant (0 =
 .142, n.s.); however, CPC has a negative effect on new
 product innovativeness (r3 = -.206, p < .05) when process
 interdependence is low (one standard deviation below the
 mean) (see Figure 2, Panel A). Similarly, H2b is supported

 because the moderating effect of process interdependence
 on the relationship between CPC and new product speed to

 thermore, the simple slope analysis indicates that when
 process interdependence is high (one standard deviation

 above the mean), CPC has a negative influence on new
 product speed to market (f3 = -.184, p < .05), and when it is
 low (one standard deviation below the mean), the effect of
 CPI on new product speed to market is significant and posi-
 tive ((3 = .246, p < .05) (see Figure 2, Panel B).

 Finally, H3a and H3b, which predicted that moderating
 effects of process complexity on the relationship between
 CPC and new product innovativeness and speed to market,
 are not supported. Neither interaction term is significant
 (innovativeness: .031, n.s.; speed to market: f3 = -.079,

 Discussion

 Theoretical Implications
 Although the importance of customer participation in
 manufacturers' NPD processes has been well articulated
 (Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2000), little empirical evidence
 exists regarding this phenomenon. This article is among the
 first to explore the relationship between customer participa-
 tion activities and NPD success, as reflected in new product
 innovativeness and speed to market. The major findings and
 their implications for marketing literature are discussed in
 this section.

 market but does not affect innovativeness. However, the
 moderating effects of process complexity are not significant
 on either new product innovativeness or speed to market.
 Yet process complexity can facilitate the OEM customer's
 involvement, challenge existing routines, and improve new
 product innovativeness, as well as hurt the effect of CPC on
 new product speed to market, because of the back-and-
 forth, trial-and-error procedures it entails. This insignificant
 effect may result from the opposing mechanisms associated
 with process complexity. Presumably, when the develop-
 ment process is complex, the development team is forced to
 adopt more formalized, predetermined coordination mecha-
 nisms to avoid coordination errors. The consequent lack of
 flexibility may diminish or even eliminate opportunities for
 informal interactions that are essential for new product
 innovativeness. Simultaneously, the formalized and pre-
 determined coordination mechanism might eliminate the
 interactive procedures that hinder development speed. In
 other words, these mechanisms might work in opposite
 directions, and their effects likely cancel out each other.
 Additional research should explore the boundary conditions
 for these opposing mechanisms to obtain a more nuanced
 view of when process complexity might influence the
 effects of CPC on new product innovativeness and speed to
 market.

 highly connected.
 Though not formally hypothesized, the direct effect of

 network connectivity on new product speed to market
 appears negative but marginally significant. In other words,
 regardless of the level of customer participation, a highly
 connected downstream network can slow development
 speed. A highly connected downstream network might
 entail particular caution on the part of the component manu-
 facturer in terms of product acceptance from downstream
 distributors and retailers, which may result in component
 manufacturers' extra prudence in the development process
 and thus slow the process overall.

 Furthermore, when process interdependence is high,
 CPC positively influences product innovativeness but
 delays speed to market. In contrast, when process inter-
 dependence is low, CPC significantly improves the speed to

 Second, the notion of social networks has begun to
 receive increasing attention in marketing literature (e.g.,
 Anderson, Hakansson, and Johanson 1994; Rindfleisch and
 Moorman 2001; Wuyts and Geyskens 2005). For example,
 Rindfleisch and Moorman (2001) reveal the relevance of
 social network theory for explaining information acquisi-
 tion and usage by collaborators and competitors. Wathne
 and Heide (2004, p. 86) specifically indicate that "a promis-
 ing avenue for further research is ... to include network
 effects at the customer level." The current research high-
 lights this point by introducing social network theory into
 the theoretical development. The results suggest that social
 network theory is relevant to the network effect in a busi-
 ness relationship context; further studies should continue to
 draw on this theory for other marketing contexts, such as
 the effect of consumers' network properties on new product
 adoption (Frels, Shervani, and Srivastava 2003).

 context typically focus on relationship (e.g., Sivadas and

 Dwyer 2000), resource (e.g., Kotabe and Swan 1995), or
 organizational (e.g., Robertson and Gatignon 1998) charac-
 teristics. However, Lewis and colleagues (2002, p. 546)
 specifically state that "researchers need more encompassing
 theoretical frameworks (at different levels) ... to enable
 insights into the NPD process." Existing research on NPD is
 largely disjointed, such that studies exploring the business
 relationship level focus on how relationship characteristics
 and social capital drive information sharing and coordina-
 tion (e.g., Sivadas and Dwyer 2000) whereas those on the
 microproject level primarily center on how the specific pro-
 ject is structured and coordinated within and across differ-
 ent development tasks (e.g., Sobrero and Roberts 2001).
 This study bridges this gap to include both project-level fac-
 tors (e.g., process interdependence, process complexity)
 and relationship-related factors (e.g., CPI, CPC) and dis-
 cusses their effects on NPD success.

 transfer diverse information into the Cell development
 process, helping improve its innovativeness. However, man-
 agers must be wary of the type of information transferred
 into the NPD process in this scenario because incorporating
 this type of diverse and conflicting information into the
 development process may significantly slow down the
 development process.

 Second, the decision to include OEM customers in a

 significant portion of the development tasks carries certain
 benefit-risk trade-offs. Specifically, if the nature of the
 development requires a high level of interaction and coordi-
 nation across different stages, a significant OEM customer
 role is likely to delay the development process. In contrast,
 when the manufacturer and OEM customer can partition the
 tasks and take advantage of each party's knowledge and
 expertise in specific areas, development speed is likely to
 increase.

 Fourth, this article enhances the understanding of rela-
 tionship marketing. Information sharing and coordination
 represent two of the most important characteristics that con-
 tribute to relationship outcomes (Dyer and Singh 1998; Jap
 1999). However, existing literature does not clearly differ-
 entiate the effects of information sharing and coordination.
 By examining the respective contingency effects of CPI and
 CPC, this research sheds light on how information sharing
 and coordination work for different mechanisms. More
 important, the results challenge the traditional view that
 high levels of information sharing and coordination always
 lead to desirable outcomes. In the NPD context, depending
 on how well connected the distributors and retailers are, the
 level of information sharing may hurt outcomes such as
 innovativeness. Moreover, depending on the level of NPD
 process interdependence, a high level of codevelopment
 may slow product speed to market and harm product innov-
 ativeness. Additional research should follow this line of
 inquiry by examining the contingency effects of informa-
 tion sharing and coordination for other types of interorgani-
 zational business relationships.

 Managerial Implications
 For NPD managers, a highly innovative product and a quick
 time to the marketplace are two of the most important
 objectives. To achieve them, more manufacturers are bring-
 ing OEM customers into the development process. This
 study suggests that the involvement of OEM customers in
 NPD processes does not always lead to desirable outcomes.
 First, if the OEM customer's retailers and distributors
 are disconnected and do not maintain communications reg-
 ularly, bringing the OEM customer into the development
 process is likely to improve new product innovativeness
 because the information shared by the distributors and
 retailers through the OEM customer is more diverse. For
 example, Sony's involvement in the development of IBM's
 Cell microchip significantly improved its innovativeness
 (Forbes 2006). A possible explanation for this is that as a
 multinational corporation, Sony has a diverse base of dis-
 tributors and retailers across different countries, and these
 distributors and retailers may lack a high level of connectiv-
 ity between each other. In this sense, Sony can obtain and

 Overall, involving customers in the NPD process is a
 complex task. The successful management of customer par-
 ticipation requires managers to understand (1) the priority
 of the development objectives (i.e., innovative product or
 fast development time), (2) the level of connectivity
 between the OEM customer's distributors and retailers, and
 (3) the nature of the development task (whether a high level
 of interaction is required during the process).

 Limitations and Future Research Directions

 As with any other research, this study has several limita-
 tions. First, this research focuses on OEM customers in
 three SICs (35, 36, and 37), and though the sample includes
 NPD activities for diverse product groups, studies that cover
 a broader spectrum of industries would enable researchers
 to test the generalizability of these findings. Specifically,
 the context of this research is industrial markets; further
 studies might extend the framework into consumer markets
 (e.g., Bendapudi and Leone 2003) to compare how cus-
 tomer participation activities differ. In such markets, con-
 sumers' participation activities, such as information sharing
 and codevelopment, are likely influenced by personal
 experience and psychology. Thus, tapping into consumer
 psychology to understand consumer participation, product
 innovation, and speed to market represents a fruitful direc-
 tion to pursue.

 Second, this study obtained measures of downstream
 customer network connectivity from single respondents,
 namely, OEM customers. This single-source measure may
 involve certain biases with regard to these connections. In
 particular, depending on the communications between the
 OEM customer and its downstream customers, the under-
 standing of connectivity among downstream customers
 might differ. Additional studies could use secondary data to
 depict the industry network and map individual firms' posi-
 tions in it. This method would also enable researchers to
 explore other network characteristics, such as the OEM cus-
 tomer's network centrality and how it may affect participa-
 tion activities and new product outcomes. Specifically, it
 might be expected that an OEM customer's central network
 position helps it gain needed market information for NPD
 activities. However, an OEM customer with high network

 centrality may also develop structural rigidity, such that its
 organizational processes and resource deployment decisions
 align tightly within its web of collaborative partners, which
 in turn hurts NPD activities. Thus, studies examining the
 boundary conditions regarding network centrality and new
 product outcomes are warranted.

 Third, other contextual factors could be introduced to
 enrich the model further. For example, studies might exam-
 ine the effects of market demand from end consumers on
 downstream customer network connectivity. More specifi-
 cally, a three-way interaction may exist among the diversity
 of market demand from end consumers, network connectiv-
 ity between distributors and retailers, and an OEM cus-
 tomer's participation activities for new product outcomes.
 Other characteristics of downstream customers may alter
 the effectiveness of the OEM customer's participation activ-
 ities; for example, the diversity of downstream customers'
 roles and competencies might enhance the information
 diversity critical to new product innovativeness and create
 coordination challenges for a speedy development process.
 Finally, the number of OEM customers may influence the
 dynamics of customer participation activities and the even-
 tual outcomes of new product innovativeness and speed to
 market.
