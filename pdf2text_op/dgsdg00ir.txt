This study explores the relationships among unionization, compensation prac-
tices, and employee attachment (quit rates and tenure) among trucking companies
to assess the applicability of Freeman and Medoff’s exit/voice argument. Union-
ization was associated with lower quit rates, higher tenure, a better compensation
package, and stronger voice mechanisms. The relationship of unionization to quit
rates and tenure becomes nonsignificant after accounting for compensation (pay
and benefits), and voice mechanisms do not add explanatory variance.

THERE IS STRONG evidence that turnover is lower in heavily
unionized industries and among unionized workers than in nonunionized
settings. Many researchers argue that this is largely due to union monop-
oly bargaining power that increases wages. Freeman (1980) and Freeman
and Medoff (1984), on the other hand, propose that unionization reduces
voluntary turnover not only through monopoly bargaining power but also
by providing workers greater voice in decisions that affect their work life.
This article examines these propositions empirically, assessing the extent
to which unionization effects on employee turnover and retention are

attributable to unionization per se, to wages and compensation policies,
and to the existence of voice mechanisms. It represents a rare evaluation
of the issues at the organizational rather than the individual level of anal-
ysis, providing a complement to the extensive union literature focusing
exclusively on individual workers.

Unionization and Exit/Voice Tradeoffs

Turnover is an expensive organizational outcome, and companies
expend considerable time and resources in attempts to reduce turnover, par-
ticularly dysfunctional turnover (Dalton and Todor, 1993). Ostensibly, one
benefit of unionization is a reduction in the quit rate. Empirical research
consistently shows lower quit rates in unionized than in nonunionized orga-
nizations (e.g., Blau and Kahn, 1981; Brown and Medoff, 1978; Freeman,
1980; Leigh, 1979; Long and Link, 1983; Wilson et al., 1990; Wooden and
Baker, 1994).

Many arguments are offered about why quit rates are lower when
employees are unionized. The first of these concerns union effects on
wages, the monopoly bargaining power of unions leading to higher wages
in unionized settings. Following efficiency wage theory, higher wage rates
in unionized organizations “lock” employees in, making them unwilling to
risk less money and worse benefits with a different employer (Katz, 1986;
Stiglitz, 1984).

This argument has intuitive appeal. But in a comprehensive review of
empirical work, Freeman and Medoff (1984) posited that it is not simply
unions’ monopoly bargaining power but their ability to establish “voice”
mechanisms that accounts for the relationship of unions and quits. This
position is based on Hirschman’s (1970) theoretical framework proposing
that people express dissatisfaction with work relationships through one of
two mechanisms—exit and voice. Freeman and Medoff’s (1984) applica-
tion of this idea to unionized settings proposes that unionized employees
are better able, and thus more likely, to use voice mechanisms; non-
unionized employees are more constrained to rely on exit mechanisms.
Two union-related policies account for this effect, the “development of
grievance-arbitration systems, which enable workers to appeal manage-
rial decisions, and seniority-based personnel policies” (Freeman and
Medoff, 1984:104). Nonunionized employees are less likely than union-
ized employees to have access to grievance mechanisms.

Empirical evidence sheds light on these arguments. Based on a series
of analyses, Freeman (1980) reported that unionization and wage levels
were strong predictors of quit rates. Because the effects of unionization


Unionization, Compensation, and Voice Effects on Quits and Retention

/ 627

on quit rates persisted after controlling for wage rates, he inferred further
that the remaining effects were due to unmeasured voice effects of union-
ization. Similar results were reported in a study conducted in the United
Kingdom—unionization had a strong and significant effect on quits after
controlling for wages (Wilson and Peel, 1991). It is noteworthy that in
this sample, contrary to most U.S. samples, wage rates were not related to
quit rates. Likewise, in a study using the Australian Longitudinal Survey
data, Miller and Mulvey (1991) found that unionization reduced quits
over and above any effect of wages and that there was no relationship
between wage rates and quit rates. Within the United States, in a study of
unionized teachers, Rees (1991) reported that the strength of the griev-
ance procedure was significantly negatively related to quits.

Taken together, these studies offer relatively unambiguous support for
Freeman and Medoff’s (1984) argument that union monopoly bargaining
power, in the form of increased wages, does not account exclusively for
lower quit rates among unionized firms and that voice mechanisms are also
critical in this context. These conclusions can be strengthened by the inclu-
sion of various supplemental elements in the research design. First, as Free-
man and Medoff (1984) note, since the monopoly power of unions derives
from wages and benefits, it is important to include both in the design. Sec-
ond, voice effects must be measured directly rather than inferred indirectly
from residual effects of unionization. Third, since unionization effects may
be temporally dynamic, it is useful to replicate earlier research with more
current data. Fourth, measurement problems with turnover and quit-rate
variables (e.g., Gupta and Jenkins, 1991; Mobley, 1982) often lead to the
recommended use of tenure (rather than quits), and it is important to assess
the applicability of conclusions about unionization effects to tenure as well
as quit rates. Fifth, it is useful to supplement the frequent individual-level
studies of unionization effects with parallel organizational-level studies
(see, e.g., Arthur, 1992; MacDuffie, 1995).

These issues are addressed in previous research but rarely integrated
within a single study. The present study is designed to do so. It provides a
very different approach to addressing the relationship of unionization and
tenure. It is conducted in the United States with data obtained in the 1990s.
It includes measures of both wages and benefits, as well as voice mech-
anisms. It examines the impact of wages, benefits, and voice on both
aspects of employee attachment, i.e., quit rates and tenure. It is conducted
at the organizational level, with a sample of companies in a single indus-
try. Limiting the analysis to a single industry enables control over extrane-
ous sources of variance and a more streamlined examination of union
effects. The specific setting, the trucking industry, is particularly suited


628 / DELERY, GUPTA, SHAW, JENKINS, JR., AND GANSTER

to this investigation. The industry and its unionization dynamics are
described below.

Industry Context

As noted, we report an organizational-level analysis of unionization
and quits among a sample of trucking companies. The trucking industry
may be particularly suited to this investigation for several reasons. One,
quit rates in the industry are traditionally well above the national average,
with driver turnover estimated to range from 38 to 200 percent (Corsi
and Fanara, 1988). There is thus sufficient variance in quit rates in the
industry for meaningful analyses to be possible. Two, unionization rates
are comparatively high among truck drivers, yielding reasonable numbers
of both unionized and nonunionized firms. Three, the job of truck
driver, although affording some interfirm variations, is relatively similar
throughout the industry. Thus job-related and occupational sources of
extraneous variance are minimized, an issue of some concern (Delaney et
al., 1989). Four, single-industry research at the organizational level is
vitally needed in the field (e.g., Baysinger and Mobley, 1983) because it
controls against extraorganizational sources of contamination. Given the
independent nature of drivers’ jobs, voice issues may not be relevant in
this industry. This concern is alleviated by the presence of sufficient vari-
ance on voice variables within the industry (see descriptive information
below), but nonetheless, the issue should be explored further in other
industrial settings.

The trucking industry has gone through significant changes over the
past 20 years, primarily due to deregulation of the industry through the
Motor Carrier Act of 1980. During regulation, motor freight was trans-
ported either by “for hire” carriers or by private company fleets. Deregu-
lation fostered severe competition in the “for hire” sector, and firms with
private fleets often outsourced the freight function to “for hire” carriers as
a result.

Within the “for hire” segment, carriers can be classified into one of
two categories—those providing less-than-truckload (LTL) service and
those providing full-truckload (TL) service. Some carriers also specialize
in the transportation of specialized commodities (e.g., hazardous materi-
als), but these carriers typically resemble TL carriers more than they do
LTL carriers.

For decades prior to deregulation, the industry was dominated by the
Teamsters Union. Estimates placed the percentage of the industry under
union contract to be near 100 percent at that time (Belzer, 1995). After


Unionization, Compensation, and Voice Effects on Quits and Retention

/ 629

deregulation, however, union density in the industry dropped signifi-
cantly and is now estimated to be about 24 percent in the TL segment and
65 percent in the LTL segment (Belzer, 1995; Hirsch, 1993). The drop in
density is largely due to growth in the “for hire” TL segment. Entry bar-
riers are relatively low in this segment, and a large number of nonunion
firms emerged in the 1980s. These carriers often offer lower wages and
benefits but have remained nonunionized.

This drop in union density raises two questions: Do unions still have
significant bargaining power? Is the trucking industry an appropriate
context for the examination of union effects? Several factors suggest a
positive answer. Although union-related wage differentials are smaller
since deregulation, they are still sizable (Belzer, 1995; Hirsch, 1988, 1993;
Rose, 1985, 1987). Unions have been unwilling to make wage concessions
to maintain or increase union density (Hirsch, 1993). Union wages are still
higher than nonunion wages in both the TL and LTL segments, but LTL
drivers generally fare better than their TL counterparts (Belzer, 1995).

In fact, these factors constitute strengths of the present study. Since
unions still have significant bargaining power in the industry (particularly
in the LTL segment), they can secure better compensation packages
(including wages and benefits) for their members. Compensation-related
differences should thus account, at least in part, for differences in employee
attachment within the industry. At the same time, since union bargaining
power has declined in the past two decades, monopoly bargaining effects
should not completely overshadow voice effects. If voice effects truly
explain a substantial portion of the variation in employee attachment, then
employees should be less likely to quit even though the union has not been
able to provide dramatically above-market wages. In other words, the set-
ting enables the detection of both compensation and voice effects.

Summary

This study examines compensation and voice effects of unionization on
employee attachment. To supplement prior individual-level research, this
study analyzes these effects at the firm level. We expect quit rates to be
higher and tenure to be lower in nonunionized than in unionized firms.
We expect these effects to be attributable partly to the higher wages and
benefits in unionized settings and partly to voice effects (as represented in
the presence of grievance procedures and in seniority-based personnel
policies). To the extent that a nonunionized firm resembles a unionized
firm along these dimensions (i.e., it offers similar wages, benefits, griev-
ance mechanisms, and seniority-based policies), then no differences in


630 / DELERY, GUPTA, SHAW, JENKINS, JR., AND GANSTER

attachment should be evident. We examine these issues in the trucking
industry and focus on a job (i.e., truck driver) that is universal and rela-
tively similar throughout the industry.

Method

Sample. The population for this study consisted of 3104 trucking com-
panies listed in the 1993–1994 TTS Blue Book of Trucking Companies
(Blue Book), which contains information reported by motor carriers to the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). To examine compensation and
voice effects systematically at the firm level, it was necessary to limit the
sample to those companies with sufficient employees to have developed
human resources management practices. Thus we included only those
firms with at least 30 total employees in either the 1991–1992, 1992–1993,
or 1993–1994 Blue Book data. This resulted in a revised sample of 1169
companies. Of these, 97 were excluded because they employed no perma-
nent drivers, using “owner-operators” exclusively, or because they had
ceased trucking operations in the interim. The final sample included the
remaining 1072 companies. A 24-page questionnaire was mailed to the
highest human resources manager in each company. Completed responses
were returned by 379 respondents, yielding a response rate of 36 percent
(379/1072).

Measures. The focus of all human resources management questions
was the driver. That is, pay, voice, etc. information was obtained not
about employees in general but about truck drivers in particular. The
questionnaire supplied information on most variables, although supple-
mentary data from the Blue Book are also used. Unless noted otherwise,
the measures reported below are drawn from the questionnaire.

Unionization. Unionization was measured as the percentage of drivers
covered under a collective-bargaining agreement. Among the 56 LTL
carriers in the sample, 24 were 100 percent unionized, 31 had no union
representation, and 1 had a few (less than 50 percent) unionized drivers.
Among TL carriers, 244 had no unionized drivers, 13 had a few (less than
50 percent) unionized drivers, 14 had mostly (more than 50 percent)
unionized drivers, and 58 were 100 percent unionized.

Employee attachment. Two aspects of attachment were measured, quit
rates and tenure. Quit rates were measured as a percentage for the year
1994. This variable has a lower bound of 0 percent but no upper bound


Unionization, Compensation, and Voice Effects on Quits and Retention

/ 631

because quit rates can exceed 100 percent. The quit-rate variable used in
the analyses was calculated by adding 1 to remove zeros and then taking
the natural logarithm. One hundred seventy-eight respondents provided
data on quit rates. Analyses involving quit rates are based on this sub-
sample. Driver tenure was assessed as the percentage of drivers who had
worked for the firm for more than 24 months. This cutoff was used in the
questionnaire because, during the pilot phase of the project, it was deter-
mined that the majority of turnover in the industry occurred during the
first 2 years of a driver’s employment. Traditionally, in individual-level
research, an average tenure measure is used. Since industry experts advo-
cated a 2-year tenure measure instead, we used that measure here. Still,
the two measures—average tenure and 2-year tenure—are likely to be
correlated, particularly given the lower turnover rates for drivers with
greater tenure. Information on driver tenure was provided by 290 respon-
dents, and analyses involving this variable are based on this subsample.

Pay and benefits practices. Two sets of variables were of interest: pay
and benefits. Log pay was the natural logarithm of average annual pay for
a typical driver. Information on three kinds of benefits was obtained. Paid
days off was the sum of the total number of paid vacation, sick leave, and
holiday days a driver received in a year. Health insurance and disability
insurance were each measured as the percentage of the premiums for
these benefits paid by the company.

A negotiable factor in the trucking industry is the amount of time driv-
ers spend at home, which can affect quit rates significantly (Shaw et al.,
1998), since drivers frequently can spend many days or even weeks on the
road away from home, particularly in the long-haul segment. This factor
was therefore included in the study as a compensation/benefits dimension.
Times home is the number of times per month that drivers were typically
routed home.

Voice mechanisms.

Information was obtained on two direct voice
mechanisms, the use of formal grievance procedures and participation
in decision making. Information on formal grievance procedures was
obtained with a single item, measuring the proportion of employees
covered by such procedures. Respondents were instructed as follows:
Below is a list of programs sometimes found in trucking and other compa-
nies. Please indicate what percent of your drivers are currently involved
in each program or innovation—formal grievance procedures. The ques-
tion had seven response options: “none” (0 percent), “almost none”
(1–20 percent), “some” (21–40 percent), “about half” (41–60 percent),


632 / DELERY, GUPTA, SHAW, JENKINS, JR., AND GANSTER

“most” (61–80 percent), “almost all” (81–99 percent), and “all” (100
percent). The question and response format were taken directly from
Lawler et al. (1992). Participation in decision making was measured with
a five-item scale using seven-point Likert-type response options ranging
from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (7). Sample items are
“Our drivers can make important work-related decisions,” “Our drivers
make decisions that affect their work,” and “Our drivers have a lot of
freedom in how they do their jobs.”

Two indirect measures of employee voice were also used. As noted,
seniority-based personnel policies are sometimes considered voice mech-
anisms, and information on two such policies was obtained. Seniority-
based layoffs was coded 1 if the company had a formal policy of basing
layoffs on seniority and 0 if it did not. The use of seniority-based pay
raises was measured by a single item asking the extent to which differ-
ences in pay rates across drivers were based on seniority. Responses were
obtained on a five-point Likert-type scale from “not at all” (1) to “to a
very large extent” (5).

Control variables. In intraindustry organizational-level analyses, it is
important to control for the effects of variables that are either unique to an
industry or that affect observed organizational-level relationships. Sev-
eral such control variables were used. Carrier type is the primary business
type for the motor carrier. Respondents reported the percentage of truck-
load (TL), less-than-truckload (LTL), and specialized commodity (SC)
hauling done by the company. Research consistently shows LTL carriers
to have remarkably different turnover patterns than TL and SC carriers
(Lemay et al., 1993). In our data, characteristics of TL and SC carriers
were very similar across all study variables. For ease of interpretation,
LTL carriers were given a score of 0 on this variable and TL and SC carri-
ers a score of 1. Organizational size is the total number of employees in
the company. Organizational age was measured as 1994 minus the found-
ing year for the company. Founding year was obtained from the Blue
Book. Both size and age are important controls in organizational-level
research in general (Delery and Doty, 1996; Huselid, 1995; MacDuffie,
1995). The natural logarithm of age and size were used in all analyses.

could contaminate observed zero-order correlations, partial correlations
of the independent variables with quit rates, driver tenure, and unioniza-
tion (removing the effects of controls) are shown in Table 3.

The first substantive issue of interest was the relationship between
unionization and employee attachment. The zero-order correlation between
quit rates and unionization was −0.43 (p < 0.001), and the partial correla-
tion was −0.29 (p < 0.001). In addition, the zero-order correlation between
unionization and tenure was 0.29 (p < 0.001), and the corresponding partial
correlation was 0.15 (p < 0.01). Thus, consistent with previous research,
unionization is strongly related to employee attachment, with unionized
firms exhibiting greater attachment levels.

The second substantive issue of interest was the relationship between
unionization on the one hand and compensation practices and voice mech-
anisms on the other hand. Zero-order and partial correlations reflecting
these relationships are also contained in Tables 2 and 3. The relationship
of pay to unionization is of particular interest here. Log pay had a sig-
nificant zero-order correlation with unionization (r = 0.18, p < 0.001).
In this sample, the average annual wage was $34,509 for drivers in non-
unionized firms and $37,277 for drivers in firms where at least 50 percent
of drivers were unionized. This represents approximately an 8 percent
union wage differential between unionized and nonunionized firms. Since

many studies report a counterpart differential at the individual level
(Hirsch, 1993), we also approximated this statistic. We multiplied the
average driver pay for a firm by the total number of drivers in unionized
firms and in nonunionized firms and divided these two figures by the total
number of unionized and nonunionized drivers, respectively, in the sam-
ple. This analysis produced a 21 percent wage differential, a figure similar
to that obtained in individual-level studies.

Unionization also was positively related to benefits. Unionized work-
ers received an average of almost 25 paid days off per year, whereas their
nonunionized counterparts received only 15. Unionized firms paid an
average of 87 percent of health insurance premiums and 65 percent of
disability insurance premiums, whereas nonunionized firms paid an aver-
age of 75 and 36 percent of these premiums, respectively. Despite these
overall differences, several nonunionized firms in the sample paid drivers
more and offered better benefits than some of the unionized firms. In
other words, wages and benefits cannot be considered proxy measures
for unionization per se and must be viewed as substantively different
constructs.

A strong positive relationship was detected between unionization and
the existence of a formal seniority-based layoff policy (r = 0.53, p < 0.001)
and unionization and grievance procedures (r = 0.47, p < 0.001), but not

the other two voice measures. These results provide mixed support for the
argument that voice mechanisms are stronger in unionized settings.

The relationship between unionization and how often drivers are routed
home was significant and in the predicted direction. On average, union-
ized drivers were routed home 20 times per month, whereas their non-
union counterparts were routed home only 12.5 times. This is at least
partly attributable to the higher unionization rates among LTL carriers,
where by the design of the job drivers are usually home much more often.
Beyond this, among both TL and LTL carriers, times home is a negotiable
matter, and unionization most probably affects company policies about
the amount of time drivers are away from home.

In short, pay and benefits, the existence of formalized grievance proce-
dures, and the use of formal seniority-based layoff policies were related
to unionization. Participation in decision making and seniority-based pay
raises were not significantly more prevalent in unionized settings. Com-
pensation practices display predicted zero-order and partial relationships
with attachment. The same is true of the relationships between voice mech-
anisms and attachment, except for the negative relationship of seniority-
based pay and tenure.

Tests of the exit/voice hypothesis. The third, and the central, focus of
the study was the extent to which the relationship between unionization
and attachment was a function of compensation and/or voice mecha-
nisms. A series of hierarchical multiple regressions was used to address
this issue. The first step of the regressions included the control variables,
the second step added unionization, the third step added the five compen-
sation practices, and the fourth and last step added all four voice mecha-
nisms. That is, voice effects on employee attachment were assessed after
controlling for compensation practices. The results of these analyses
using quit rates as the dependent variable are shown in Table 4.

Quit rates. In all, 157 firms were included in the equations predicting
quit rates (the lower N reflects missing data on independent and control
variables). Of these, 27 percent had at least some drivers represented by
a union. For the trucking industry, this is a lower union density than
reported for previous decades. Nonetheless, it is not atypical for U.S. firms
in general. Unionization was more prevalent among the 18 LTL firms
included in the analysis (61 percent reported having unionized drivers)
than among the 139 TL firms (only 23 percent reported having unionized
drivers).

As can be seen from Table 4, the control variables accounted for 24
percent of the variance in quit rates. Unionization explained an additional
4.2 percent of the variance (β = −0.23, p < 0.01). The five pay and benefits
measures explained an additional 4.1 percent of the variance. Of these,
two are significant. Log pay (β = −0.24, p < 0.001) and times home (β =
−0.26, p < 0.001) were both strongly negatively related to quit rates. Inter-
estingly, the unionization variable became nonsignificant in this step (β =
−0.11, ns), suggesting that unionization affects quit rates largely through
its effects on compensation systems.

The final equation contained all independent and control variables,
including the voice measures. This model did not explain significant
additional variance (∆R2 = 0.015, ns). Furthermore, none of the voice
variables reached significance. These results suggest that unionized firms
have lower quit rates primarily due to union compensation effects and
that voice mechanisms are not salient in this context.

Driver tenure. Overall, 290 firms were included in the driver tenure
analyses. Nearly 26 percent of these firms reported having unionized
drivers. As with quit rates, the percentage of unionized firms is much
higher in the LTL segment of the industry (N = 42; 50 percent of these
were unionized) than in the TL segment (N = 248; 21 percent of these
were unionized). The results of the hierarchical regressions with driver
tenure as the dependent variable are presented in Table 5.
These results are nearly identical to those for quit rates. Unionization
has a significant positive effect on tenure (β = 0.14, p < 0.05), but the
introduction of pay and benefits practices into the equation reduces the
unionization coefficient to near zero (β = 0.01, ns). Thus the results again
support the compensation argument, with log pay, paid days off, and
times home constituting significant predictors (β = 0.155, p < 0.01; β =
0.141, p < 0.05; and β = 0.168, p < 0.01, respectively).
The final equation, incorporating the voice variables, shows a significant
negative correlation between seniority-based pay and tenure (β = −0.205,
p < 0.01). That is, this voice mechanism does not increase employee tenure
—it reduces it. None of the other voice mechanisms was significant in the
equation. As with quit rates, the tenure analyses do not support the union-
ization voice hypothesis.

Taken together, these results offer strong support for the compensation
argument and no support for the voice argument. Only one of eight voice
coefficients (four for each dependent variable) was significant, and this
coefficient had a sign in the direction opposite from that expected.

Response bias check. Our reliance on survey research methodology
means that it is possible that response bias affected the results. We used
archival measures from the Blue Book to address the issue of response
bias in a number of ways. We dummy coded the dependent variable 1 if a
usable questionnaire was returned and 0 if it was not. The independent
variables were obtained from the 1994 Blue Book, which contains infor-
mation reported to the ICC for the 1993 calendar year, i.e., the calendar
year for which the sample was derived. The variables used were number
of drivers, total fringe benefits cost, total highway miles driven, total
wages paid, average haul (in miles), total insurance costs, current assets,
company age, tons per mile, and average load (in tons). A series of log-
istic regressions examined differences between respondents and non-
respondents on the independent variables (Osterman, 1994). None of
these variables was significant, indicating that respondents were not sig-
nificantly different from nonrespondents.

It was also important to establish the extent of difference between
respondents who provided information on quit rates and tenure levels and
those who did not. To address this issue, we conducted two series of
logistic regressions. In the first set, the dependent variable was a dummy-
coded variable (1 = quit rate information provided, 0 = quit rate informa-
tion not provided), and the independent variables were the unionization,
compensation practices, voice mechanisms, and control variables. None
of the variables was significant in this equation. In the second set of
regressions, the dependent variable was dummy coded (1 = tenure infor-
mation provided, 0 = tenure information not provided). In these analyses,
only one variable (log employees) was significant. Larger organizations
were more likely to have missing tenure information.

Additionally, like Huselid (1995), we used Heckman’s (1979) proce-
dure for response bias check. An inverse Mills’ ratio was computed and
included in all regression equations. The inclusion of this ratio produced
nearly identical results; in no case did it change substantive findings. In
all, these analyses lead us to conclude that response bias is not of major
concern.

Discussion

The results of this study provide interesting insights into the mecha-
nisms through which unionization affects employee attachment to the
firm. Higher wages and benefits in unionized trucking settings account
for a substantial portion of unionization effects on employee attachment.
These compensation levels are partly due to monopoly bargaining power


Unionization, Compensation, and Voice Effects on Quits and Retention

/ 641

of unions, although they are probably also partly due to higher employee
skill levels in unionized settings (we were unable to measure this aspect
directly). This extends previous theory and research—voice mechanisms
were at best inconsistently related to the attachment variables of quit rates
and driver tenure.

Many researchers posit that unionization affects employee attachment
through monopoly bargaining power, raising wages and benefits, and
making it difficult for employees to leave. Thus turnover is lower and
tenure higher in unionized than nonunionized firms. These arguments
received strong support in our study. Unionization had significant co-
efficients in equations predicting quit rates and tenure before compensa-
tion variables were introduced; these coefficients were reduced
drastically and became nonsignificant with the introduction of compensa-
tion variables. This supports the efficiency wage theory argument that
unionized organizations lock employees in through higher wages and
better benefits (e.g., Katz, 1986; Stiglitz, 1984).

Descriptive information indicated an approximate 8 percent wage dif-
ferential between unionized and nonunionized companies but a 21 percent
wage differential between unionized and nonunionized drivers, a figure
comparable with that obtained in previous individual-level research. This
difference between the two numbers is most likely caused by the relation-
ship between wages and other firm-level characteristics. This difference
underscores the importance of careful attention to level of analysis issues.
It dictates extreme caution in comparing individual-level research with
firm-level research.

In addition to this wage differential, unionized firms provided more
paid days off, got drivers home more often, and covered a greater propor-
tion of health and disability insurance premiums. Simply put, unions had
a strong influence on employee benefits. The continued emphasis in Con-
gress on benefits issues (particularly health insurance) further attests to
their salience in the American workplace. It is reasonable that wages and
benefits accounted for a substantial portion of the variance in quit rates
and tenure.

A major thrust of this study was an examination of the role of voice
mechanisms in unionization effects on attachment, above and beyond the
effects attributable to compensation practices. This is the crux of the Free-
man and Medoff (1984) argument—unions affect attachment through both
compensation practices and voice mechanisms. We examined four differ-
ent voice mechanisms. Unionized firms were more likely to have formal-
ized grievance procedures and seniority-based layoffs. Some of the voice
mechanisms also had significant zero-order and partial correlations with


642 / DELERY, GUPTA, SHAW, JENKINS, JR., AND GANSTER

attachment variables. But none of these variables predicted quit rates in
the final equation, and only one—seniority-based pay—predicted driver
tenure, but in the wrong direction. These results are inconsistent with
Freeman’s (1980) and Freeman and Medoff’s (1984) assertions regarding
exit/voice mechanisms. Unions typically do provide greater voice mecha-
nisms to employees, but our results suggest that higher wages and better
benefits account for much of the union effect on retention in the trucking
industry.

Of course, alternative explanations of our findings are possible. We
obtained data about a single job in a single industry in a single country at
a single point in time. These constraints necessarily limit the potential
generalizability of the results. At the same time, these factors also allow
a relatively clean and noise-free assessment of union-related dynamics.
Extraneous sources of contamination are severely restricted in the design.
Additionally, the focus on the trucking industry and the driver job could
limit generalizability. It is possible that union voice effects are weaker in
this industry given the independent nature of the driving job and given
that drivers evince stronger occupational than organizational identifica-
tion. Future studies in other industrial settings where employees are more
attached to organizations than to occupations should be useful in address-
ing this issue.

A further question about the study is our relatively low sample size for
quit rates in the LTL segment. This problem is alleviated because higher
sample sizes were available for driver tenure analyses. The pattern of
results for the two dependent variables was substantively similar, foster-
ing confidence in the robustness and reliability of the findings.

The measures we used in the study also can be questioned. We focused
on the proportion of benefits premiums covered by the firm, but other
ways of measuring this variable are arguably superior. We measured the
existence of formal grievance procedures, not the extent to which such
procedures actually were used. Admittedly, these measures can be honed
to reflect better the constructs of interest. Nonetheless, they provide use-
ful information. They also enable rare, if not unique, direct assessment of
benefits and voice effects. Future research should focus on developing
better measures of these constructs, but at the same time, the fact that our
relatively simple measures of voice were unrelated to attachment, after
controlling for wages and benefits, is noteworthy. It is the pattern of
results—none of the voice variables predicted quit rates, and only one
predicted tenure (albeit not in the expected direction)—and not a single
relationship by itself that leads to questions about the applicability of the
voice hypothesis in the trucking setting.


Unionization, Compensation, and Voice Effects on Quits and Retention

/ 643

Another factor that gives our results credence is the fact that the design
had a built-in replication. We measured employee attachment using two
related but distinct measures: quit rates and employee tenure (Freeman,
1980; Merrilees, 1981; Wilson et al., 1990; Wooden and Baker, 1994).
Essentially parallel results were obtained with both attachment variables.
To the extent that our observations were chance phenomena, the replica-
tion would likely have revealed them as such. That the dynamics among
unionization, compensation practices, and voice mechanisms were virtu-
ally identical for both quit rates and tenure fosters confidence in the valid-
ity and stability of our findings.

Our study was conducted at the firm level, while much of the prior
research on this topic has relied on individual-level data (Freeman, 1980;
Freeman and Medoff, 1984). Exit/voice effects are theoretically applica-
ble at both the individual and firm levels. Empirically, at least based on
our tests, they appear to be stronger at the individual than at the firm level.
It is thus essential that further research be conducted at both levels within
the same industry. Only then will definitive conclusions about the viabil-
ity of the hypothesis at both levels be possible.

In short, our study controlled many sources of extraneous variance,
measured benefits and voice mechanisms directly, examined two attach-
ment variables, was conducted in a relatively heavily unionized industry,
and addressed current economic and union dynamics. It thus offers a
unique snapshot of exit/voice tradeoffs in affecting employee behaviors
in the trucking industry.

To conclude, our results support the argument that the monopoly bar-
gaining power of unions, as evident in wages and benefits, accounts for
the higher employee attachment witnessed in unionized settings. But
they do not support Freeman and Medoff’s (1984) exit/voice hypothesis.
Given the extensive work of Freeman (1980) and his colleagues at the
individual level, it is imperative to supplement the database with exami-
nations at the firm level, enabling more authoritative statements. Our
results also highlight the importance of economic context and union den-
sity in determining observed attachment dynamics. Because of a number
of design factors (outlined above), our study represents a significant step
in elucidating the exit/voice dynamics of unionization. We hope that the
issues we illuminated will be examined in greater depth in future research
across different settings and different levels of analysis.
