Recently, many companies have recognized the concepts of green supply chain manage-
ment or supply chain environmental management. However, relatively little research
attention has been devoted to the consideration of relations between greening the supply
chain, green innovation, environmental performance and competitive advantage. Hence,
this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing empirical evidence to encourage companies
to implement green supply chain and green innovation in order to improve their environ-
mental performance, and to enhance their competitive advantage in the global market. A
model is constructed to link the aforementioned constructs. Data were collected through
a questionnaire-based survey across 124 companies from eight industry sectors in Taiwan.
The data are analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling and the results from the ﬁnal
measurement model are used to evaluate the structural model that veriﬁes the signiﬁcance
of the proposed relationships. A prominent result of this study is that greening the supplier
through green innovation contributes signiﬁcant beneﬁts to the environmental perfor-
mance and competitive advantage of the ﬁrm.

1. Background and research motivation

With the increasing concern about environmental issues from customers, the public and governments around the world,
companies have been developing a number of environmentally friendly programs and ‘‘green’’ products (e.g. green brands,
green technologies, and eco-design) (Hoffmann, 2007; Zhu et al., 2008; Yung et al., 2011). It is becoming increasingly impor-
tant for companies to raise their environmental awareness because more and more international customers and buyers are
now requiring their suppliers to produce products that do not contain hazardous and toxic substances. They are also increas-
ingly expecting their suppliers to reduce their consumption of natural energy during the production process in order to re-
duce the negative impacts of production on the environment. According to Green et al. (1995), the main driving force to
implement environmental management is compliance with regulation and legislation and cost saving. Bowen et al.
(2001) also indicated that companies will implement Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practices if they can gain
both ﬁnancial and operational beneﬁts. Well-designed environmental standards can increase a producer’s initiatives to inno-
vate green products and green technologies. Shrivastava (1995) suggests that companies can differentiate their products, im-
prove product quality and lower the cost of production through product and process innovations. They can also extend the
environmental concept into their packaging design considerations.

Continuous innovation is a vital solution to overcome pressures from customers, competitors, and regulators (Porter and
Van der Linde, 1995). Therefore, it is very important to adopt green innovation and implement Green Supply Chain Manage-
ment (GSCM) practices within an organization’s value chain (Steger, 1993). Rao and Holt (2005) conducted empirical re-
search on GSCM practices and their relationship between competitiveness and economic performance. Their research
showed that implementing GSCM can improve a company’s competitiveness and economic performance. This is in line with
previous research which has found that organizations can further reduce production costs and increase economic efﬁciency
by applying environmental related initiatives (Porter, 1991). Improvements in corporate environmental performance and
compliance with environmental regulations can also contribute to a company’s competitiveness (Bacallan, 2000). In addi-
tion, the implementation of GSCM through internal and external environmental management contributes substantial ben-
eﬁts by enhancing corporate competitiveness and improving environmental performance (Rao, 2002; Tukker et al., 2001;
Cairncross, 1992; Hart, 1995; Schmidheiny, 1992; Shrivastava, 1995; Porter and van der Linde, 1995; Vermulen, 2002).

Green innovation can be classiﬁed into three main categories: green product innovation; green process innovation; and
green managerial innovation (Chen et al., 2006; Chen, 2008). Chen et al. (2006) found that green product and green manu-
facturing process innovations are positively associated with corporate competitive advantage. Chen (2008) then introduced
the concept of core competencies. His study showed that green core competencies, deﬁned as ‘‘the collective learning and
capabilities about green innovation and environmental management’’ (p. 533), have a positive inﬂuence on a ﬁrm’s ability
to develop green product and process innovations. In turn, this helps to improve a company’s green image and thus compet-
itive advantage. These studies do not consider the impact of green innovation speciﬁcally on environmental performance nor
the inﬂuence of a greener supply chain on green innovation or performance.

Although the green supply chain management literature is rich, relatively little research attention has been focused on
Taiwanese industry. For green innovation, Chen et al. (2006) and Chen (2008) are the only studies in this area that focus
on Taiwan. In Taiwan, the economy has grown drastically in the past few decades, but this has had a negative impact on
the natural environment. Taiwan’s industries are mostly involved in Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) and Original
Design Manufacturing (ODM). These companies play important roles in global markets as they are the largest partners of the
world leading IT organizations (Yu and Hsu, 2006). Globally, Taiwan is a major international producer of information prod-
ucts (Chen, 2004). The consumption of resources by Taiwanese industry cannot therefore be underestimated.

This research will therefore focus on the Taiwanese context, as it is relatively under-researched. Although other studies
have considered the relationship between green supply chain management and performance or competitive advantage,
these have not considered the links between a greener supply chain (greening the supplier) and green innovation, or the abil-
ity to develop green products and manufacturing processes and green managerial innovation. In this study, these relation-
ships will be examined and subsequently the impact of these factors on both the environmental performance and
competitive advantage of organizations. Theoretically, the contribution of this research is therefore to consider the interplay
and relationships between all of these factors, which has not previously been considered. Speciﬁcally, this study will answer
two research questions: (1) To what extent are ﬁrms greening their supply chain and implementing green innovation? (2)
Are there any signiﬁcant direct and indirect links between greening the supplier, green innovation, environmental perfor-
mance and competitive advantage? To answer these research questions, a questionnaire survey was conducted with Taiwan-
ese industry respondents. This paper will present the results of the survey and identify implications for practice and further
research needed in this area. Section 2 presents a literature review and develops the hypotheses which form the basis of this
study. Section 3 presents the research method and how the data were collected and analysed. Section 4 discusses the key
statistical results and Section 5 discusses these results and concludes this paper.

2. Review of literature and hypotheses development

Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) plays an important role in traditional Supply Chain Management (SCM) (Linton
et al., 2007). In the past, a company could gain competitive advantage through implementing SCM practices, such as improv-
ing sourcing decisions (Wouters et al., 2009). However, companies nowadays have to integrate their supply chain with envi-
ronmental management due to pressures from customers who have increasing environmental concerns. In addition,
organizations can generate more business opportunities than their competitors if they can address environmental issues
(e.g. by implementing a proper environmental management system) successfully (Hansmann and Claudia, 2001).

Although there are many competing deﬁnitions for GCSM (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004), GSCM can be broadly classiﬁed into
internal and external environmental management (Rao, 2002). Internal environmental management focuses on internal sup-
port and commitment for GCSM, compliance with certiﬁcation and the existence of environmental management systems
within the organization (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004). External environmental management is related to greening the suppliers
so that they are involved with the organization towards achieving environmental objectives (Bowen et al., 2001; Lamming
et al., 1999; Lloyd, 1994; Rao, 2002; Hamner, 2006; Makower, 1994; Green et al., 1998; Rajagopal and Bernard, 1993). It also
includes green purchasing, cooperation with customers, environmental requirements, investment recovery, and eco-design
practices (Rao and Holt, 2005) or green product innovation (Chen et al., 2006).

In the literature, some studies have provided evidence that integrating suppliers more strongly into the product innova-
tion process can improve a ﬁrm’s overall performance (e.g. Bonaccorsi and Lipparini, 1994; Ragatz et al., 2002; Johnsen,
2009; Lau et al., 2010). However, conﬂicting evidence has been found in other studies, where they show that such integration


824

T.-Y. Chiou et al. / Transportation Research Part E 47 (2011) 822–836

could result in poor performance; for example, increased development time and development costs (Zirger and Hartley,
1994; Ittner and Larcker, 1997; Ragatz et al., 2002; Das et al., 2006). Extending this into the debate around environmental
practices, it is therefore important to understand the impact and relationship of more closely integrating GSCM practices and
in particular greening the suppliers with green innovation processes to better understand the relationship and impact on
both environmental performance and competitive advantage.

2.1. The relationship between greening the supplier and green innovation

Environmental issues are becoming part of strategic planning in organizations due to stricter environmental regulations
and customers’ increasing concern about environmental issues (Walton et al., 1998). As a result, long-term strategic advan-
tages can be developed by working closely with suppliers (Rajagopal and Bernard, 1993; Chan, 2007). A partnership working
and appraisal system is necessary to ensure the appropriate level of product and service quality can be achieved (Sroufe,
2006). This involves a signiﬁcant change in the attitudes of those companies who want to establish closer supplier relation-
ships, which requires an investment of time and resources for both parties (Lettice et al., 2010). Those companies need to
work closely with their suppliers to provide sufﬁcient guidance, advice and assistance, and to share their knowledge and
skills to help them to become more ‘green’. Working towards this, many large companies have established their own envi-
ronmental standards for their suppliers (Rao, 2002).

Green innovation is often classiﬁed into green product and green process innovations (Klassen and Whybank, 1999; Por-
ter and Van der Linde, 1995; Hart, 1995; Schmidheiny, 1992; Chen et al., 2006; Chen, 2008). For example, Klassen and Why-
bank (1999) categorized green innovation into the product design aspect and the manufacturing process aspect. From the
product design aspect, green innovation includes the process to modify an existing product design to reduce any negative
impact on the environment during any stage of a product’s life cycle. From the process aspect, green innovation is any adap-
tation to the manufacturing process that reduces the negative impact on the environment during material acquisition, pro-
duction, and delivery. Green managerial innovation cannot be underestimated in the implementation of GSCM practices.
Senior management support is one of the key drivers for the successful implementation of innovation (Hamel and Prahalad,
1989). Zhu and Sarkis (2004), in their research on Chinese manufacturing industry, found that getting commitment from top
or middle level managers has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the implementation of successful internal environmental manage-
ment. In this research, we therefore deﬁne green innovation as comprising of green product innovation, green process inno-
vation and green managerial innovation.

With increasing concern for environmental issues and regulations, customers and buyers require their suppliers to offer
products and materials which take environmental issues into consideration. Therefore, it is necessary to work closely with
suppliers early in the product development process to reduce material and packaging which could cause a negative impact
on the environment. It is also beneﬁcial to invite suppliers to help to improve the product design and manufacturing pro-
cesses and to improve overall compliance with environmental regulations. Rao (2002) identiﬁed that greening the supplier
initiatives do lead to greener suppliers and more green innovations. However, other studies have found that such integration
could result in poor performance; for example, by increasing development time and development costs (Zirger and Hartley,
1994; Ittner and Larcker, 1997; Ragatz et al., 2002; Das et al., 2006). Finally, studies have shown that internal managerial
support for green initiatives is one of the key drivers to successfully implement environmental management systems and
practices (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004; Hamel and Prahalad, 1989). To determine whether there is a positive relationship between
greening the supplier and green innovation we propose our ﬁrst hypothesis. Other studies have tended to focus on just green
product and process innovation. For this study we separate green innovation into three parts to understand whether green-
ing the supplier inﬂuences green product innovation, green process innovation, green managerial innovation, or all three:

H1. Greening the supplier is positively associated with green innovation.

H1a: Greening the supplier is positively associated with green product innovation.
H1b: Greening the supplier is positively associated with green process innovation.
H1c: Greening the supplier is positively associated with green managerial innovation.

2.2. The relationship between green innovation and environmental performance

As discussed above, green innovation is composed of green product innovation, green process innovation and green man-
agerial innovation. Chen et al. (2006) and Chen (2008) considered how green product and process innovation affect compet-
itive advantage and the green image of an organization, but did not consider how they affected an organization’s
environmental performance. They also did not consider how green managerial innovation affects environmental perfor-
mance. Although other studies have considered how GCSM initiatives and greening the supplier impact environmental per-
formance (Porter and Van Der Linde, 1995; Cairncross, 1992; Hart, 1995; Schmidheiny, 1992; Zhu et al., 2008), they have not
explicitly considered the links between green innovation and environmental performance. In this study, we therefore pro-
pose to contribute to the literature by exploring whether the three categories of green innovation do affect environmental
performance. The following hypothesis and sub-hypotheses are therefore proposed:


T.-Y. Chiou et al. / Transportation Research Part E 47 (2011) 822–836

825

H2. Green innovation is positively associated with environmental performance.

H2a: Green product innovation is positively associated with environmental performance.
H2b: Green process innovation is positively associated with environmental performance.
H2c: Green managerial innovation is positively associated with environmental performance.

2.3. The relationship between green innovation and competitive advantage

Innovation is one of the key forces to increase corporate competitive advantage (Porter and Van Der Linde, 1995). With
more environmental regulations, it is becoming increasingly necessary to consider the whole product life cycle when making
product and design process decisions. Green products and processes not only reduce the negative impact on the environ-
ment, but they can also increase company’s competitive advantage (Porter and Van Der Linde, 1995). Noci and Verganti
(1999) have investigated this through a qualitative case study and Chen et al. (2006) initiated a survey in the information
and electronics industry to consider how green product and process innovations affect competitive advantage. However,
there is still a need to provide more empirical evidence across different industries and to consider all three types of green
innovation. The following hypotheses are therefore proposed:

H3. Green innovation is positively associated with competitive advantage.

H3a: Green product innovation is positively associated with competitive advantage.
H3b: Green process innovation is positively associated with competitive advantage.
H3c: Green managerial innovation is positively associated with competitive advantage.

2.4. The relationship between environmental performance and competitive advantage

In general, companies can improve their environmental performance by implementing environmental management or
GSCM. Organizations can add value to core business programs by implementing environmental programs successfully
(Hansmann and Claudia, 2001). In addition, GSCM promotes efﬁciency and synergy which includes enhancing environmental
performance, improving competitiveness and cost saving (Rao and Holt, 2005). Companies can also enhance their green cor-
porate image by improving their environmental performance, which in turn helps to open up new business opportunities
and improve competitive advantage (Chen, 2008). Vachon and Klassen (2008) showed a correlation between environmental
performance and competitive advantage in their survey of North American organizations. However, Rao’s (2002) study of
ﬁrms in South East Asia (Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore) could not ﬁnd a correlation between
environmental performance and economic performance/competitive advantage. This study will therefore extend this
previous research into the Taiwanese context and collect more empirical evidence to see if there is indeed a link between
environmental performance and competitive advantage. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:

H4. Environmental performance is positively associated with competitive advantage.

2.5. The relationship between greening the supplier and environmental performance and between greening the supplier and
competitive advantage

Working with suppliers on long term strategy to reduce the negative impact on the environment improves corporate
competitive advantage. Rao (2002) identiﬁed that companies would like to ‘green’ their supply chains by implementing
mentoring methods, and by building stronger relationships and networks. The study also found that companies can improve
their environmental performance by working more closely with their suppliers. Similarly, Hamner (2006) found that buyers
can improve their environmental performance by educating their suppliers about environmental issues and helping their
suppliers to implement environmental management systems. Some studies have attempted to develop supplier selection
models from an environmental performance point of view (e.g. Lee et al., 2009; Bai and Sarkis, 2010). However, they over-
looked the effect of greening the suppliers on environmental performance. Although some studies have already identiﬁed the
importance of some supply chain activities (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004), more understanding of the speciﬁc relationship between
greening the suppliers and environmental performance is sought in this study. This leads to the ﬁfth hypothesis:

H5. Greening the supplier is positively associated with environmental performance.

Working closely with suppliers can enhance competitiveness because suppliers can provide organizations with useful
market information. For example, some of the leading organizations in Taiwan have enhanced their competitiveness in
the global market, improved their product quality and reduced production cost through implementing partnering systems
(Rao, 2002). In the past few years, one key success factor for GSCM has been to work with suppliers who have met environ-
mental criteria to reduce the cost of compliance with regulations (Sarkis, 1999). Many large and medium sized enterprises
have worked with their suppliers not only to meet the environmental regulations, but also to organize other environmental


826

T.-Y. Chiou et al. / Transportation Research Part E 47 (2011) 822–836

activities for their suppliers, such as providing environmental technical advice and awareness seminars to them and inviting
suppliers to be involved earlier in the product development process (Handheld and Nichols, 1999; Rao, 2002; Rao and Holt,
2005). This has led to improved product quality, reduced costs (unnecessary expense) and enhanced competitiveness in the
market. Again, this study focuses speciﬁcally on greening the supplier, which has received less attention in previous studies
and the following hypothesis is therefore proposed:

H6. Greening the supplier is positively associated with competitive advantage.

2.6. The relationship between green product, process and managerial innovation

Since in this study we have included three types of green innovation, it is also interesting to investigate the synergy and

correlation among these three variables. Therefore, the following hypotheses are established:

H7. Green product innovation, green process innovation and green managerial are positively associated with each other.

H7a: Green product innovation is positively associated with green process innovation.
H7b: Green process innovation is positively associated with green managerial innovation.
H7c: Green managerial innovation is positively associated with green product innovation.

In summary, the literature review indicates that greening the supplier has a positive inﬂuence on green innovation
(Rao, 2002; Tukker et al., 2001; Porter and Van Der Linde, 1995; Shrivastava, 1995). In addition, green innovation has a
positive impact on competitive advantage (Porter and Van Der Linde, 1995; Klassen and Whybank, 1999; Rao, 2002; Rao
and Holt, 2005; Chen et al., 2006; Chen, 2008). Furthermore, greening the supplier has a positive impact on environmental
performance (Rao, 2002; Rao and Holt, 2005; Tukker et al., 2001; Crowe and Brennan, 2007) and competitive advantage
(Rao, 2002; Rao and Holt, 2005). This study aims to formulate the complex relationship between all of the factors: greening
the supplier; green product, process and managerial innovation, environmental performance and competitive advantage.
These relationships form a conceptual framework, as illustrated in Fig. 1, which will be tested in this study. In this study,
greening the supplier is an exogenous variable, and green innovation, competitive advantage and environmental perfor-
mance are endogenous variables. In addition, green innovation is also an intervening variable in this study.

3. Research method

3.1. Research design

In order to carry out Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) that establishes causal relationships among the constructs shown
in Fig. 1, an empirical questionnaire survey followed by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is employed. SEM is a statistical
methodology which provides parameter estimates of the direct, indirect or total direct links and causal relationships be-
tween observed or manifest and reference variables and unobserved variables. Bentler (1988) states that SEM theory repre-

sents ‘‘causal’’ processes that create observations on multiple variables. SEM can also provide parameter estimates for rela-
tionships among unobserved variables (latent constructs) which are measured using indicator variables. In general, an SEM
model can be decomposed into two sub-models: a measurement model and a structural model. The measurement model
deﬁnes relationships between the observed and unobserved variables and evaluates the reliability and validity of the model.
In contrast to the measurement model, the structural model deﬁnes the relationships among the unobserved variables and
tests the research hypotheses.

For SEM, we have to identify the latent variables that are exogenous and endogenous. Exogenous latent variables are
independent variables that are not inﬂuenced by other latent variables. Endogenous latent variables are dependent variables
that are affected by exogenous variables in the model. In this study, ‘‘greening the supplier’’ is an exogenous variable. ‘‘Green
innovation’’, ‘‘environmental performance’’ and ‘‘competitive advantage’’ are endogenous latent variables. There are different
analytical tools to analyze SEM. In this study, AMOS 7.0 is employed. The proposed model (see Fig. 1) which would be val-
idated has six latent constructs, each being measured by the indicators in Table 1. A ﬁve-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Dis-
agree and 5 = Strongly Agree) is used as the response format for each indicator variable. The pre-test analysis is illustrated
later in this section before analyzing the data for SEM.

3.2. Sample size and data collection

In this study, an online questionnaire survey is the research instrument and an invitation to complete the questionnaire
survey was sent out by email. The questionnaire was developed based on the literature presented in preceding sections, and
is attached in Appendix A of this paper. The questionnaire items regarding the construct ‘‘Greening the supplier’’ (items 1–6)
are adopted from the studied conducted by Rao (2002) and Rao and Holt (2005). The respondents were asked if the environ-
mental actions had been taken into consideration when selecting and working with suppliers. In addition, the items regard-
ing ‘‘Environmental performance’’ and ‘‘Competitive advantage’’ are also adopted from Rao (2002) and Rao and Holt (2005).
They are items 16–18 and items 19–22 within the questionnaire respectively. The other three variables for ‘‘Green innova-
tion’’ are measured based on the items proposed by Chen et al. (2006) and Chen (2008), which can be found in items 7–15 of
the questionnaire.

The emailing list had been randomly selected from the online resource ‘‘Business Express’’ (http://business.com.tw), a
business directory, which lists the ﬁrms in Taiwan under different industry sectors. The ﬁnal sample frame was 1569 com-
panies from eight industries. Most of Taiwan’s companies do not have a supply chain department to coordinate and manage
their upstream and downstream supply chain activities. Therefore, the purchasing department was identiﬁed as the target
respondent of this study. A covering letter was included to explain the purpose and intention of the survey. It also promised
anonymity of both the respondent and the company in the research report.

The invitation was e-mailed directly to the company’s purchasing departments. In order to maximize the response rate, a
follow up email was sent to respondents 2 weeks after sending out the ﬁrst email. Within 2 weeks of the ﬁrst invitation, 70
questionnaires were received. A further 54 questionnaires were received within 2 weeks of sending out the follow up email.
Therefore, a total of 124 completed surveys had been received from 1569 respondents. All of these returned surveys were
complete and acceptable for analysis. Therefore the overall response rate is 7.9%. Based on responses to previous studies
(e.g. 72 respondents in Lu’s (2000) study; 83 respondents in Oum and Park’s (2004) study; 72 respondents in Sodhi and Son’s
(2009) study), these ﬁgures are representative and are of an acceptable standard for publication.

3.3. Pre-test analysis

The main purpose of the pre-test analysis was to validate the sample size and identify whether there was any indication
of non-response bias between the two groups of respondents. First of all, the acceptability of the sample size was investi-
gated. Sample size is one of the key issues in SEM because it affects the degrees of freedom of the model and the model ﬁtting
process. In general, when sample size is lower than 100, SEM analysis is not stable (Kline, 1998). According to Bagozzi and Yi
(1988), a sample size of between 100 and 200 is required to use the maximum likelihood method. Therefore, the sample size
of 124 in this study is acceptable.

The second test was to verify the non-response bias between the two groups of respondents. Initially, 70 questionnaires
were received before a follow-up email was sent out, which represents a 4.46% response rate. A second set of 54 question-
naires were received after sending a follow-up email, which represents a 3.44% response rate. Non-response bias was estab-
lished in two separate tests, the t-test and the Chi-Square test.

The t-test is the most commonly used statistical method to evaluate the differences in means between two groups. To
compare the data from the two different response groups, an independent sample t-test was undertaken and the results
of the p-value for each observed variable was greater than or equal to 0.05, indicating that there was no signiﬁcant difference
between the groups. The data are summarized in Table 2a. The Chi-Square test was then employed to test the two groups of
respondents based on industry sector, ISO14000 certiﬁed or not and the number of employees. These results are summarized
in Table 2b. Again, a p-value equal to or greater than 0.05 indicated that there was no signiﬁcant difference between the two
groups of respondents. Based on the results of these two tests, there is an indication that there might be no non-response
bias.

3.4. Reliability analysis

Reliability analysis is a method to measure the precision or lack of distortion of the indicators. Reliability concerns the
consistency, precision and repeatability of the indicator (Kline, 1998). Through the value of Cronbach’s Alpha, reliability
of each construct and items established in the study are veriﬁed. In addition, item-total correlation, composite reliability
and variance extracted estimate are used to validate the reliability of each construct through Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis
in the SEM model.

1. Cronbach’s Alpha: Ranges between 0.00 (without any reliability) and 1.0 (perfect reliability) inclusive. The larger the
Cronbach’s Alpha, the better is the consistency in the measurement (Vogt, 1999). Nunnally (1978) suggests that the Cron-
bach’s Alpha should be at least equal to 0.5 and preferably larger than 0.7.

2. Corrected Item-Total Correlation (ITC): Sums up each item correlation and then excludes items with ITC values below 0.4

(Nunnally, 1978), to see if excluding the item increases the Cronbach’s Alpha.

3. Composite Reliability: Measures the internal consistency of a single construct. The reliability is higher if the value of com-
posite reliability is greater than 0.6 (Hatcher, 1994). However, a minimum of 0.7 is recommended (Fornell and Larcker,
1981).

4. Average Variance Extracted (AVE): Measures the internal consistency of the model. If the AVE is greater than 0.5, then

reliability is good (Hatcher, 1994).

The results of the reliability analysis are discussed in Section 4.

4. Results and analysis

4.1. Descriptive analysis

The main purpose of using descriptive analysis is to describe the basic features of the data in this study. It provides a sim-
ple summary of how the respondents from different industry sectors have implemented greening the supplier and green
innovation practices. The size of the companies in the sample is shown in Table 3. There are 29 companies out of 124 respon-
dents (23.4%) with less than 200 employees, and only 7 of these 29 (24%) are ISO 14000 certiﬁed. In addition, there are 95
companies with more than 200 employees (76.6%), and a high percentage (91.58%) of these companies have been ISO 14000
certiﬁed. That means the respondents are mostly medium and large enterprises. Table 4 shows the statistics of the respon-
dents with respect to their industry. Most of the respondents (nearly 50%) come from two industries: the computer, elec-
tronic product and components industry and the chemical, rubber and plastic product industry. In addition, 24 out of 28
(85%) of the companies in the chemical, rubber and plastic industry have ISO14000 certiﬁcation. The car and transport equip-
ment sector companies in this sample all have ISO14000 certiﬁcation.

The mean and standard deviations were also calculated to further explain the current situation for greening the supplier,
green innovation, environmental performance and competitive advantage for the Taiwanese ﬁrms in the sample. Each of
these observed variables were evaluated on a ﬁve-point scale (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree).
As can be seen in Table 1, the means for all items across all of the constructs are in the range of 3.76–4.46. This implies that
many companies in Taiwan have already implemented actions to improve the greening of their suppliers; and to develop
green products, processes and managerial innovations and have had corresponding results in terms of good environmental
performance and competitive advantage

4.2. Reliability of the measurement model

A total of 22 items (observed variables) are in the model to measure the relationship between greening the supplier, green
product innovation, green process innovation, green managerial innovation, environmental performance and competitive
advantage. After evaluating the ITC values, it was not necessary to exclude any item in this study because no ITC value
was lower than 0.4, as shown in Table 1. The Cronbach’s Alpha for six latent constructs were calculated to test the reliability
of the questionnaire. The reliability measures are listed in Table 5. The Cronbach’s Alpha of each item is more than 0.9 and
less than 1.0 (0.9 < Cronbach Alpha < 1.0), which means that the questionnaire has high reliability and consistency.

In terms of composite reliability, the values for all constructs (0.85, 0.77, 0.96, 0.92, 0.94 and 0.96) are greater than the
recommended value of 0.7. That means the measures of the constructs are highly reliable in terms of their internal consis-
tency. In addition, the AVE values for the variables are all greater than the recommended value of 0.5 (66%, 78%, 88%, 86%,
83%, and 86%), which means that those (indicator) variables in the questionnaire have been understood.

4.3. Structural model: statistical signiﬁcance

The results from the ﬁnal measurement model were used to evaluate the structural model that tested the signiﬁcance of
the theorized relationships. The ﬁnal model with path coefﬁcients is shown in Fig. 2. Fourteen of 15 path coefﬁcients are
signiﬁcant. The path coefﬁcients were measured to support hypotheses, as shown in Table 6. In addition, the goodness of
ﬁt test is carried out. This test was established by different indices to negate bias related to the use of a single index (Hair

et al., 1995 and Bollen and Long, 1993). The sets of goodness of ﬁt indices that were employed in this study are the goodness
of ﬁt index (GFI), Chi Square (v2)/degrees of freedom (df), the comparative ﬁt index (CFI), the Tucker Lewis index (TLI), the
normed ﬁt index (NFI) and the incremental ﬁt index (IFI). According to Bagozzi and Yi (1988), a value of 0.9 is acceptable for
the model ﬁt for GFI, CFI, NFI and IFI. Byrne (1989) indicates that the model of ﬁtness (GFI and AGFI) with a range of values
between 0.80 and 0.89 is acceptable. Moreover, the modiﬁcation indices were evaluated in order to modify and increase the
validity of the model ﬁtness. Several sets of SEM models and analyses were conducted for the model with alternate path de-
leted or added to increase the ﬁtness of the model.

The value of the goodness of ﬁt statistics (illustrated in Table 7) were: GFI = 0.88, v2/df = 1.66(v2 = 222.6, df = 134),
CFI = 0.98, NFI = 0.94, IFI = 0.98 and TLI = 0.96. Although v2 is recognized as the measure of ﬁt, it is inﬂuenced by the size
of samples (Byrne, 2001). Because of the limitation of sample size, it is replaced by the ratio of v2 to the degree of freedom
(v2/df), and it is acceptable if the value is less than 3.0 (Carmine and McIver, 1981; Marsh et al., 1998). In this study, the value
of v2/df is 1.66, which is therefore acceptable. In addition, the GFI is within the acceptable levels of 0.80–0.89, which rep-
resents the overall degrees of freedom in the speciﬁed model. In contrast to GFI, the next set of goodness of ﬁt statistics
was measured for incremental and comparative indexes of ﬁt (Hu and Bentler, 1995). One which should be considered in
Baseline Comparisons is CFI, which is recognized as an index to reﬂect all sample sizes and measure the comparative reduc-
tion in noncentrality (Bentler, 1990). The value is 0.98 in this model and is highly acceptable. Moreover, if the value of TLI,
which is 0.96 in this study, is larger than 0.95, it is considered a good indicator of good ﬁt (Hu and Bentler, 1995). Next, the
values of NFI and IFI are 0.94 and 0.98 respectively, which fall into the acceptable ranges. Bentler (1990) indicates that NFI
can estimate the model ﬁtness based on small sample sizes. Based on these values, the ﬁnal structural model is acceptable,
even under the limitation of a small sample size.

4.4. Results and discussion for structural equation model

The measurement model measures the reliability of each latent construct; and the structural model with path coefﬁcients
are to test the 15 hypotheses, as shown in Table 6. The ﬁnal structural model with path coefﬁcients is illustrated in Fig. 2. The
path coefﬁcients are measured to test 15 hypotheses between ﬁve latent constructs: ‘‘Greening the supplier’’ represents an
independent variable (f1); whereas the others are dependent variables, which are ‘‘green product innovation’’ (g1), ‘‘green
process innovation’’ (g2), ‘‘green managerial innovation’’ (g3), ‘‘environmental performance’’ (g4) and ‘‘competitive advan-
tage’’ (g5). The causal effects between these latent variables are also measured. The ﬁnal survey data support fourteen of the
ﬁfteen hypotheses in this study, as shown in Table 6.

First of all, the association of greening the supplier with environmental performance (H5) is signiﬁcant (c = 0.39,
p < 0.001). More importantly, the path association between environmental performance and competitive advantage is strong
and highly signiﬁcant (b = 1.87, p < 0.001), which supports H4. Secondly, green process innovation (H2b) and green product
innovation (H2a) are positively associated with environmental performance (b = 1.26 and 1.04, respectively; p < 0.001).
However, green managerial innovation (H2c), surprisingly, did not show a signiﬁcant relationship with environmental per-

managerial innovations in improving a company’s environmental performance. This might be because managerial innova-
tion has a more indirect effect on the measurement of environmental performance, compared to the other two types of inno-

vation. Managerial innovation relates to high level strategy and hence it is positively linked to competitive advantage (H3c to
be discussed below). Normally, the managerial innovation will be implemented through process or product innovation,
which can be veriﬁed by H7a and H7b, to be discussed later. The results imply that green managerial innovation may have
a moderating effect on green product and process innovation, which is further discussed in Section 5.

Thirdly, the associations between greening the supplier and green product innovation (H1a), green process innovation
(H1b), and green managerial innovation (H1c) are also highly signiﬁcant (c = 0.99, 0.93, and 0.95, respectively, p < 0.001).
Likewise, the path associations between greening the supplier and competitive advantage (c = 0.99, p < 0.001) provide sup-
port for H6. N addition, green product innovation (H3a), green process innovation (H3b) and green managerial innovation
(H3c) all have positive path associations with competitive advantage (b = 0.59, 0.6, and 0.72, respectively, p < 0.001). This
implies that a company can gain competitive advantage through the implementation of green product innovation, green pro-
cess innovation and green managerial innovation.

Finally, the associations between green managerial innovation and green product innovation (H7c) and green process
innovation (H7b) are signiﬁcant (b = 1.04 and 0.94, respectively, p < 0.001). Similarly, the path association between green
product innovation and green process innovation (b = 0.92, p < 0.001) provides support for H7a. Green product innovation
therefore contributes to green process innovation, and green managerial innovation contributes to both green product inno-
vation and green process innovation, as shown in Fig. 2.

More importantly, the standardized direct and indirect effects between greening the supplier and green innovation are
shown in Table 8. The direct effect of greening the supplier to competitive advantage is 0.99, and the indirect effect through
green innovation between greening the supplier and competitive advantage is 5.48. The indirect effect (5.48) for greening the
supplier to competitive advantage with the intervening variable of green innovation is greater than the direct effect (0.99) for
greening the supplier to competitive advantage. Therefore, the intervening variable of green innovation contributes to the
relationship between greening the supplier and competitive advantage.

5. Discussion and conclusions

There are some limitations of this survey research. First of all, a total of 124 questionnaires have been collected from 1569
organizations. Although this sample size is acceptable for this study, the response rate is still relatively low, which might
affect the representativeness of this sample to all enterprises in Taiwan. In addition, the sample was designed to cover a vari-
ety of industry sectors, rather than to focus on a single industry sector. Chen et al. (2006) had only focused on the informa-
tion and electronics sector and this study aimed to extend their study beyond a single sector in Taiwan. However, as a
consequence, the results of our study may not be sufﬁciently speciﬁc for a single industry or sector. Another limitation of
this research is related to common method bias. Since the survey was conducted with a single questionnaire (i.e. common
source), measurement error may be introduced (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The authors have, however, followed the procedures
suggested by Podsakoff et al. (2003) and Menguc and Auh (2008) in order to reduce some of the risks for common method
bias. They include: (i) protecting respondent anonymity and reducing evaluation apprehension; (ii) careful construction of
scale items to avoid item ambiguity; (iii) separating or combining the scale items from different constructs; and (iv) statis-
tical tests to negate bias related to the use of a single index. The ﬁnal limitation is that the questionnaire survey was not pilot

tested prior to the full scale survey. However, in view of the reliability tests presented in this paper, where all Cronbach’s
Alpha are above the accepted standard 0.7, the survey was shown to be reliable, even though it was not pilot tested (whereas
in Chen et al.’s (2006) survey, some of the Cronbach’ Alpha values fell below the 0.7 threshold).

Despite these limitations, this research provides signiﬁcant insights regarding the deployment of green supply chain
management practices (in terms of greening the supplier and green innovation) in Taiwanese industry, and the implications
for performance (in terms of environmental performance and competitive advantage). The results in the previous section
demonstrate that greening the supplier leads to green product innovation, green process innovation, and green managerial
innovation. The results of this study also show that a company can acquire competitive advantage by engaging in green
product innovation, green process innovation and green managerial innovation. In addition, the results of this study show
that greening the supplier leads to competitive advantage. More importantly, the ﬁndings support that the intervening vari-
ables of green product, process and managerial innovation contribute to competitive advantage. More speciﬁcally, the indi-
rect effect between green innovation and greening the supplier leads to better competitive advantage than the direct effect
between greening the supplier and competitive advantage.

However, the results supported only two of the three hypothesized relationships between the three constructs for green
innovation (i.e., green product innovation (H2a), green process innovation (H2b), green managerial innovation (H2c)) and
environmental performance. The path coefﬁcient between green managerial innovation and environmental performance
is not signiﬁcant. This implies that green managerial innovation is not as effective as green product and process innovation
for improving a company’s environmental performance. This is possibly because green managerial innovations are normally
implemented through green product and process innovations. This should be further investigated in future research, which
should study the moderating effect of green managerial innovation on the relationship between green product and process
innovations and environmental performance.

The ﬁndings of this study show that Taiwanese companies have started to implement actions towards greening their sup-
pliers and developing greener products and manufacturing processes. The results lead to two key implications for business
practice, which are discussed in the next two subsections.

5.1. Green innovation leads to competitive advantage

Environmental management and innovation are predicted to be the most important performance indicators for the com-
petitive advantage of ﬁrms in the future. Although green managerial innovation may not necessarily result in improved envi-
ronmental performance, by focusing on green product and process innovation and green managerial innovation, ﬁrms will
gain cost savings, increased efﬁciency, increased productivity and better product quality, all leading to improved competitive
advantage. As well as enhancing the green reputation of the ﬁrm, there will also be increased opportunities to enter new
markets through green product innovation.

One potential beneﬁt of green innovation is that it increases the entry barriers of other competitors. Moreover, reducing
pollution and limiting hazardous and toxic waste can improve green efﬁciency; reduce the cost of hazardous waste disposal;
improve compliance with regulation; improve the response to external environmental pressures from customers, and en-
hance global competitive advantage with better product quality. Therefore organizations should implement environmental
management, and integrate green innovation into business strategies in order to build and maintain competitive advantage.
However, green managerial innovation may not necessarily lead to good environmental performance. Therefore, top man-
agement should focus predominantly on green product and process innovations, as there is a stronger link between these
and environmental performance.

5.2. Greening the suppliers for a win–win situation

The results of this study show that encouraging green suppliers leads to internal green product, process and managerial
innovations, which in turn enhance competitive advantage. Therefore, this research suggests that companies should work
closely with, and even integrate their business processes with, their upstream and downstream suppliers to achieve environ-
mental goals and to relieve the pressure on the buyer’s requirements. More business opportunities may then be generated by
these organizations than by their competitors in the global market.

In practice, companies should devote substantial effort to provide technical support, assistance and guidance to suppliers
to implement environmental management systems and to organize environmental awareness seminars or training sessions
to help their supplier to improve environmental performance. This will not only improve competitive advantage as discussed
before, but also raise suppliers’ environmental performance and productivity, which will result in a win–win situation be-
tween the two parties.

Although implementing environmental management systems involves capital outlay, it is a valuable investment in the
future. Organizations should continuously invest in GSCM, and in particular in greening the supplier and green innovation,
to meet tighter and tighter environmental regulations and to build and maintain sustainable competitive advantage in the
global market.

In summary, greening the suppliers and green innovation are highly related to the environmental performance of ﬁrms
and their competitive advantage. Companies should therefore devote substantial efforts to address environmental issues
along their supply chains in order to survive and maintain competitive advantage. Future research should be conducted with


834

an even larger scale survey within a single country and across more sectors. It would also be useful to conduct a comparative
survey across countries, including both developed and developing countries, with industries and economies at different
stages of maturity. This survey was focused particularly on the links between greening the supplier and green innovation
and subsequent environmental and competitive performance. Future studies could extend this to other GCSM practices as
well as exploring in more detail the moderating effect of green managerial innovation on green product and process
innovations.
