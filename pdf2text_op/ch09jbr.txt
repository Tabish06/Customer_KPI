Abstract

This study examines the role of knowledge management capacity in the relationship between strategic human resource practices and innovation
performance from the knowledge-based view. This study uses regression analysis to test the hypotheses in a sample of 146 firms. The results
indicate that strategic human resource practices are positively related to knowledge management capacity which, in turn, has a positive effect on
innovation performance. The findings provide evidence that knowledge management capacity plays a mediating role between strategic human
resource practices and innovation performance. Finally, this study discusses managerial implications and highlights future research directions.

1. Introduction

The strategic management literature recognizes innovation as
a critical enabler for firms to create value and sustain competitive
advantage in the increasingly complex and rapidly changing
environment (Madhavan and Grover, 1998; Subramaniam and
Youndt, 2005). Firms with greater innovativeness will be more
successful
in responding to changing environments and in
developing new capabilities that allow them to achieve better
performance (Montes et al., 2004). Innovation initiatives tend
to depend heavily on employees' knowledge, expertise, and
commitment as key inputs in the value creation process (Youndt
et al., 1996). The knowledge-based view depicts firms as
repositories of knowledge and competencies (Grant, 1996;
Spender, 1996). According to this view, prior studies recognize
the knowledge and competencies of human resource as valuable
assets for firms because of their characteristics of firm-specific,
socially complex, and path-dependent (Collins and Clark, 2003;
Wright et al., 2001; Youndt et al., 1996; Lado and Wilson, 1994).

Human resource practices (HR practices) are the primary
means by which firms can influence and shape the skills, attitudes,
and behavior of individuals to do their work and thus achieve
organizational goals (Collins and Clark, 2003; Martinsons, 1995).
Previous literatures have paid attentions to the link of HR practices
and organizational outcomes such as productivity, flexibility, and
financial performance (e.g. MacDuffie, 1995; Ichniowski et al.,
1997; Youndt et al., 1996; Delery and Doty, 1996; Pfeffer, 1998;
Mendelson and Pillai, 1999; Collins and Clark, 2003), but the
understanding needs to be extended to encompass innovation
performance (Laursen and Foss, 2003). Accordingly, the present
study attempts to address the link of HR practices and firm's
innovation performance from the knowledge-based perspective.
For innovation to take place, firms may leverage human
capital to develop organizational expertise for creating new
products and services. However, expertise is much more
complex and is primarily the results of deliberate practices on
representative tasks in the domain (Ericsson and Charness,
1997). These deliberate practices entail individuals wanting to
perform the tasks and making efforts to improve performance.
Firms can identify and exert a set of strategic HR practices to
elicit the willingness and motivation of employees to engage in
performing these delicate practices to develop organizational

expertise for business objectives such as innovation perfor-
mance (Jacobs and Jones, 1995; Swanson, 1994). Accordingly,
strategic HR practices can be conducive to innovative activi-
ties because strategic HR practices may allow firms to dis-
cover and utilize knowledge and expertise in the organization
(Scarbrough, 2003). However, knowledge is within the human
capital and firms cannot easily transfer the knowledge among
individuals inside the firm (Hansen, 1999; Grant, 1996).
Although a firm has access to the knowledge, skills and expertise
of employees, it may need to possess good capacities in managing
knowledge management tools in place to ensure effective utili-
zation of the human capital in the development of organizational
expertise for innovation. Knowledge management is an approach
to adding or creating value by more actively leveraging the know-
how and expertise resided in individual minds (Ruggles, 1998;
Scarbrough, 2003). As noted above, knowledge management may
influence the relationship between strategic HR practices and
innovation performance.

Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to examine the
mediating effect of knowledge management capacity between
strategic HR practices and innovation performance from the
knowledge-based view. The remainder of the paper proceeds as
follows. The next section considers the relevant literature and sets
out the hypotheses of this study. Following is the methodology for
the study. Then, the paper presents the results of the empirical
study in achieving the goals as those set out above. In the last
section, the paper discusses managerial implications and high-
lights future research directions.

2. Research background and hypotheses

2.1. Human resource practices

Owing to the increasing importance of HR practices to the
competitive advantages of firms in the rapidly changing knowl-
edge-based economy, some scholars have paid attentions to
examine the determinants on the adoption of HR practices (e.g.
Tannenbaum and Dupuree-Bruno, 1994) and their effects on
organizational outcomes, such as productivity and efficiency (e.g.
MacDuffie, 1995; Ichniowski et al., 1997; Youndt et al., 1996),
and financial performance (e.g. Delery and Doty, 1996; Pfeffer,
1998; Mendelson and Pillai, 1999; Collins and Clark, 2003).

Tannenbaum and Dupuree-Bruno (1994) explore the relation-
ships between organizational and environmental factors and the
use of “innovative human resource practices”. The items in
“innovative human resource practices” include training, recruit-
ment, selection, and employee involvement. The results demon-
strate that external variables of labor availability and public
scrutiny exhibit the linear relationships while favorability has a
non-linear relationship with the use of HR practices. In terms of
organizational factors, agency size exhibits a stronger linear effect
than formalization and centralization on the use of HR practices.
In investigating the impacts of “innovative human resource
practices” on manufacturing performance, MacDuffie (1995) uses
four measures including hiring, compensation, status barriers, and
training to represent innovative human resource practices. He
indicates that integration of bundles of HR practices is positively

associated with the improvements in productivity. Similarly,
Ichniowski et al. (1997) examine the productivity effects of
“innovative work practices”. They use different measures of
the innovative work practices, which include incentive pays,
recruitment and selection, teamwork, flexible job assignments,
employment security, communication, and training, and suggest
that these innovative work practices achieve higher levels of
productivity than traditional approach such as narrow job defi-
nitions, strict work rules, and hourly pay with close supervision. In
addition, by using four dimensions of human resource practices,
including staffing, training, performance appraisal, and com-
pensation, Youndt et al. (1996) indicate that an HR practices
system is directly related to multiple dimensions of operational
performance. Also, subsequent analysis reveals that manufactur-
ing strategies moderate this main effect.

In terms of financial performance, Delery and Doty (1996),
drawing on three dominant modes of theorizing, identify seven
key “strategic human resource practices”, including career ladders,
training, results-oriented appraisal, compensation, employment
security, employee voice, and broadly defined jobs, and use them
to develop theoretical arguments consistent with each of the three
perspectives. The results demonstrate that each perspective can be
used to structure theoretical arguments that explain significant
levels of variation in financial performance. Mendelson and Pillai
(1999) examine the impacts of the characteristics of “information
age organization” and indicate that the relationship between these
characteristics, including decentralization and incentives, infor-
mation practices, and internal focus and inter-organizational
networks, and business performance is stronger in industry
segments that are more dynamic. In addition, Collins and Clark
(2003) explore the black box between “strategic human resource
practices”, which include training, performance assessment,
rewards, and firm performance from a field study with 73 high-
tech firms. The results show that top managers' social networks
mediate the relationship.

Though prior research has paid attentions to the impacts of HR
practices on organizational outcomes, few studies explore the
impact of HR practices on knowledge management (e.g. Currie
and Kerrin, 2003) and on innovation performance (e.g. Laursen
and Foss, 2003). By taking an organizational learning perspective,
Currie and Kerrin (2003) use case study approach to explore the
influence of “strategic human resource practices”, including per-
formance management, recruitment and selection, employee
interaction, and career development, on enhancing knowledge
sharing within a company. They suggest that HR practices can
improve knowledge sharing in the firm with a functionally based
organizational structure and culture. In investigating the effects of
“new human resource management practices” on innovation
performance of firms in different sectors, Laursen and Foss (2003)
categorize nine HRM variables, including interdisciplinary work-
groups, quality circles, collection systems of employee proposals,
planned job rotation, delegation of responsibility, integration of
functions, performance-related pay, firm internal training, and firm
external training, into two HRM systems. Their findings indicate
that the innovation performance of four manufacturing sectors
correlates with the first system while that of wholesale and ICT
sectors is associated with the second system.

These prior research term HR practices differently, such as
strategic human resource practices (e.g. Youndt et al., 1996;
Collins and Clark, 2003; Currie and Kerrin, 2003; Collins and
Clark, 2003), innovative work or human resource practices (e.g.
Tannenbaum and Dupuree-Bruno, 1994; MacDuffie, 1995;
Ichniowski et al., 1997), new human resource practices (e.g.
Laursen and Foss, 2003), and characteristics of information age
organizations (e.g. Mendelson and Pillai, 1999). In addition, the
measurement of HR practices is in different ways in these prior
studies for coping with their research purposes. This study
purposely focuses on examining the strategic impacts of HR
practices on the innovation performance through the mediating
effect of knowledge management capacity. This study considers
those measures in the prior studies using the concepts of
strategic and innovative HR practices (e.g. Youndt et al., 1996;
Collins and Clark, 2003; Currie and Kerrin, 2003; Tannenbaum
and Dupuree-Bruno, 1994; MacDuffie, 1995) as they are more
germane to the arguments of the relationships involving HR
practices, knowledge management, and innovation. Accord-
ingly, this study adopts five dimensions, including staffing,
training, participation, performance appraisal, and compensa-
tion, in the construct of strategic human resource practices.

2.2. Strategic human resource practices and innovation
performance

The knowledge-based view concerns knowledge as a valuable
resource of the firm (Grant, 1996; Spender, 1996). The knowledge
embedded in human capital enables firms to enhance distinctive
competencies and discover innovation opportunities (Hansen,
1999; Grant, 1996; Wright et al., 2001). When firms develop new
products and improve management processes, they require the
motivation and ability of human capital to produce creative ideas,
develop innovative approaches, and exert new opportunities
(Scarbrough, 2003). Human resource management function can
influence and modify the attitudes, capacities, and behaviors of
employees to achieve organizational goals (Collins and Clark,
2003; Martinsons, 1995) and it plays a crucial role in nurturing the
necessary conditions for catalyzing and channeling individuals
towards the development of innovation activities (Scarbrough,
2003; Laursen and Foss, 2003; Michie and Sheehan, 1999). Firms
can use some strategic HR practices, such as staffing, training,
participation, performance appraisal, and compensation, as means
to motivate employees' commitment and get them involved in
creative thinking and innovation (Damanpour, 1991; Laursen and
Foss, 2003). Thus, this study argues that strategic HR practices
would play a critical role in affecting innovation performance.

When firms develop innovation activities, they encounter
relatively greater uncertainty and variability in the innovation
process (Atuahene-Gima, 1996), and they need creative
employees who are flexible,
risk taking, and tolerant of
uncertainty and ambiguity (Madsen and Ulhøi, 2005). There-
fore, firms must place more emphasis on these characteristics in
the staffing actions. When firms use creative capabilities and
innovative characteristics as hiring and selection criteria, their
employees are likely to spawn diversity of ideas and commit to
more innovation behaviors (Brockbank, 1999; Atuahene-Gima,

1996). Through effective staffing, employees become important
sources of new ideas in the firm's innovative process.

With regard to training,

it would facilitate employees'
exposure to variety of knowledge and openness to innovative
ideas (Brockbank, 1999; Beatty and Schneier, 1997; Jaw and Liu,
2003). Firms may provide employees broad and various training
programs to develop new knowledge, skills, and innovative
capability necessary for performing their work (Brockbank, 1999;
Mumford, 2000). Through training, firms can develop the
organizational expertise in terms of demand and content for the
innovation (Weisberg, 2006). Investments in training can develop
employee expertise at all levels of the organization which is likely
to provide a potentially inexhaustible source of ideas for further
innovation (Torraco and Swanson, 1995). In addition, innovation
requires employees a high level of involvement and participation
(Damanpour, 1991; Hurley and Hult, 1998). Firms may elicit
employees' involvement and participation by granting them to
solve problems and to participate in decision making that affects
their work (Damanpour, 1991; Glynn, 1996). A high level of
participation would create the conditions to encourage employees
to bring new ideas and exchange knowledge in the ongoing
innovation process and, in turn, enhance innovative outcomes
(Jiménez-Jiménez and Sanz-Valle, 2005; Tsai, 2002).

Because the innovation process is often lengthy, uncertain,
and multidisciplinary, firms should signal the importance and
value of innovation as a corporate priority, and provide formal
appraisal mechanisms to measure innovation behaviors and
outputs (Brockbank, 1999). Positive pressure from a perfor-
mance appraisal creates challenges and feelings of achieve-
ments and serves as a critical motivator for employees (Jaw and
Liu, 2003). Performance appraisal can enhance employees'
motivation to engage in innovative activities, and make firms
achieve favorable innovation results (Jiménez-Jiménez and
Sanz-Valle, 2005). Moreover, recognizing individual and team
accomplishments with compensation also encourages innova-
tion. Both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards are essential
to
motivate employees to take the challenging work, and provide
them incentives to generate more new ideas and develop
successful new products (Brockbank, 1999; Mumford, 2000).
The preceding arguments suggest that firms can use strategic
HR practices to influence the behavior and expectation of
employees, and add greater value in developing innovation.
Through effective strategic HR practices in terms of staffing,
training, participation, performance appraisal, and compensa-
tion, firms would enhance their capability in introducing new
products, services, and management system, and then achieve
better innovation outcomes.

Hypothesis 1. Strategic human resource practices relate
positively to innovation performance.

2.3. Strategic human resource practices and knowledge
management capacity

Human capital, with their knowledge, expertise, and skills,
is a valuable resource of firms (Lado and Wilson, 1994; Delery
and Doty, 1996; Wright et al., 2001; Collins and Clark, 2003).


C.-J. Chen, J.-W. Huang / Journal of Business Research 62 (2009) 104–114

107

Organizations that effectively manage and leverage the knowl-
edge and expertise embedded in individual minds will be able to
create more value and achieve superior competitive advantage
(Ruggles, 1998; Scarbrough, 2003). However, employees are
often unwilling or unable to share their knowledge and expertise
with others because of self interests and lack of trust (Currie and
Kerrin, 2003; Hayes and Walsham, 2000; Mueller and Dyerson,
1999; Davenport and Prusak, 1998). Accordingly, it is important
for firms to harness the involvement and participation of
employees through knowledge management. HR practices
are the primary approaches to elicit and reinforce employees'
knowledge and expertise that a firm requires (Martinsons, 1995;
Youndt et al., 1996; Collins and Clark, 2003). Since people
are carriers of much of organization-specific knowledge and
expertise, firms may be best to utilize HR work practices to
manage knowledge and expertise (Scarbrough and Carter, 2000;
Lave and Wenger, 1991). Some strategic HR practices, such
as staffing, training, participation, performance evaluation, and
incentive compensation, are related to enhancing commitment,
lowering turnover, and increasing performance through their
impact on employee development and motivation (Huselid, 1995;
Becker and Gerhart, 1996; Guthrie, 2001). Firms can use these
strategic HR practices to provide employees with the skills,
resources, and discretion that they need to develop knowledge
management. Thus, this study argues that strategic HR practices
are key enabling elements for firms to increase their capacity in
deploying and facilitating knowledge management tools and
activities.

An effective staffing system can help firms in selecting and
allocating competent and qualified workforce to do the required
tasks. Acquiring employees with particular knowledge and
expertise is crucial for firms to operate knowledge management
tools and activities. Those newly recruited employees are likely to
do the effective sharing of knowledge if they are able to take the
broader perspective and appropriate attitude (Currie and Kerrin,
2003). Moreover, it is also important for firms to select the
employees who can integrate effectively for development of
knowledge management capacity. Selection of individuals with
appropriate skills and attitudes to do the tasks enables firms to
integrate knowledge from diverse sources and stimulate innovative
idea generation (Martinsons, 1995; Scarbrough, 2003). In addition,
employee training is also likely to affect the development of
knowledge management capacity. Continuous professional devel-
opment is particularly important to knowledge workers. Firms need
to offer internal and external training opportunities to develop and
nurture required knowledge and expertise of employees (Jaw and
Liu, 2003; Brockbank, 1999; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995).
Exposure to diverse training programs could foster employees to
learn new knowledge and expertise, broaden their insight, and
equip them with innovative minds and skills (Nonaka and
Takeuchi, 1995). Such training programs would stimulate employ-
ees to share their expertise and experience, acquire new knowledge,
and utilize what they learn subsequently in the work. Accordingly
training programs are crucial for employees in the knowledge
management process (Argote et al., 2003; Von Krogh, 1998).

Participation, another strategic HR practice, may attract
employees to positively involve and contribute in knowledge

management and learning activities. Individuals having wider
skills, expertise, and work responsibilities should give greater
autonomy and self-regulation to do their work (Nonaka and
Takeuchi, 1995). Granting more discretion and participation in
decision making can increase employees' involvement, aware-
ness, and commitment (Damanpour, 1991; Glynn, 1996). If
employees have more opportunities to provide inputs and deter-
mine the required actions,
they may increase the diversity
and richness of knowledge exchange and bring more new ideas
(Andrews and Kacmar, 2001; Grant, 1996), thereby facilitating
the discovery and utilization of dispersed knowledge and exper-
tise in the organization.

Performance appraisals and compensation are the primary
strategic HR practices that firms can use to reinforce employees'
behaviors and induce them to comply with organizational
goals (Collins and Clark, 2003; Scarbrough, 2003). In terms of
performance appraisal, if firms want to elicit desired behaviors
from employees, they must provide feedback and incentives
that reinforce the desired behaviors (Collins and Clark, 2003).
Employees are unlikely to do knowledge management activities,
especially sharing of knowledge, as the divergent objectives set
out for them in their performance agreements (Currie and Kerrin,
2003). Accordingly, if firms set up the unified appraisal criteria
to link employees' performance with their involvements in
sharing and applying knowledge in the work, it would motivate
employees to work on knowledge management activities. More-
over, the compensation should reward creativity, risk-taking
attitude, and problem-solving ability in order to promote
knowledge diffusion and sharing (Argote et al., 2003; Von
Krogh, 1998). Individuals may put more efforts into knowledge
management activities if compensation systems reward the
contribution to acquisition and exchange of knowledge
(Scarbrough, 2003; Collins and Clark, 2003; Von Krogh, 1998).
According to the above reasoning, strategic HR practices are
helpful to motivate employees' willingness to acquire, share, and
apply knowledge within organizations. Appropriate strategic HR
practices can support and promote the development of organiza-
tional environment conducive to knowledge management
activities. Thus, the expectation is that strategic HR practices
would influence knowledge management capacity positively.

Hypothesis 2. Strategic human resource practices relate
positively to knowledge management capacity.

2.4. Knowledge management capacity and innovation
performance

Organizational innovation, entailing the development of new
products or services as well as new administrative systems, is
emerging as an important source of sustainable competitive
advantage (Damanpour, 1991; Hurley and Hult, 1998).
The innovation process involves the acquisition, dissemination,
and use of new and existing knowledge (Damanpour, 1991;
Moorman and Miner, 1998). An organization's innovativeness is
closely tied to its ability to utilize its knowledge resources
(Subramaniam and Youndt, 2005). Knowledge management is an
approach of more actively leveraging the knowledge and expertise


108

C.-J. Chen, J.-W. Huang / Journal of Business Research 62 (2009) 104–114

to create value and enhance organizational effectiveness (Gold
et al., 2001; Ruggles, 1998; Scarbrough, 2003). Firms that exhibit
a greater level of knowledge management capacity experience a
learning effect that can improve their capabilities in reducing
redundancy, responding rapidly to change, and developing
creative ideas and innovation (Scarbrough, 2003; Gold et al.,
2001). Effective knowledge management facilitates knowledge
communication and exchange required in the innovation process,
and further enhances innovation performance through the
development of new insights and capabilities (Madhavan and
Grover, 1998; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Von Krogh, 1998).
Therefore, knowledge management capacity plays a pivotal role in
supporting and fostering innovation. Since managing knowledge
in the innovation process is complex, this study focuses on those
mechanisms that the organization uses to acquire, share, and apply
new or improved knowledge.

Knowledge acquisition from the outside marketplace and the
inside employees provides opportunities for firms to recombine
current knowledge and create new knowledge (Yli-Renko et al.,
2001). The newly acquired knowledge interacting with the
existing knowledge can modify organizational knowledge stock
(Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Gold et al., 2001) and enhance the
breadth and depth of knowledge available to the firm, thereby
increasing the potential for new innovative outcomes (Galunic
and Rodan, 1998; Li and Calantone, 1998; Yli-Renko et al.,
2001). The knowledge-based view suggests that knowledge
acquisition activities will enhance a firm's ability to efficiently
perform its role (Grant, 1996). Firms with good capability to
acquire external and internal knowledge would reduce uncer-
tainty and achieve a greater number of administrative and
technological distinctiveness (Li and Calantone, 1998; Sarin and
McDermott, 2003; Yli-Renko et al., 2001). Accordingly, this
study argues that knowledge acquisition has a positive link with
innovation performance.

Knowledge sharing refers to collective beliefs or behavioral
routines related to the spread of learning among different
individuals or units within an organization (Moorman and
Miner, 1998). Prior research has discussed and demonstrated
that knowledge sharing can lead to increased innovativeness of
the firm (e.g. Kogut and Zander, 1992; Henderson and Cockburn,
1994; Szulanski, 1996; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998; Dyer and
Nobeoka, 2000; Tsai, 2001). In particular, scholars have argued
previously that knowledge sharing implies the new combination
of knowledge that has previously existed separately, which
possibly would result in process improvements or novel products
(Schumpeter, 1912/1934; Kogut and Zander, 1992; Tsai and
Ghoshal, 1998). Since knowledge exists within different
individuals and different levels of the organization, organizational
members need to share it in order to establish new routines and
mental models (Galunic and Rodan, 1998; Nonaka and Takeuchi,
1995). Also, when individuals are willing to share and exchange
knowledge, they can generate collective learning and synergistic
benefits from the processes of exchanging knowledge and
resource (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Nonaka and Konno,
1998). Innovations come about when organizational members
share their expertise and convert it into explicit form of products
or services (Von Krogh, 1998; Nonaka and Konno, 1998). Hence,

firms that are able to effectively share knowledge among
members are likely to be more innovative.

Knowledge application is a focal element in knowledge
management process (Grant, 1996). From the knowledge-based
view, the value of individual and organizational knowledge
resides primarily on its application because of stickiness and
tacitness of knowledge (Grant, 1996; Spender, 1996). New
product development and innovation require the application and
combination of specialized knowledge inputs from many
different areas (Yli-Renko et al., 2001). A deeper application
of knowledge enables firms continuously to translate their
organizational expertise into embodied products (Weisberg,
2006; Sarin and McDermott, 2003). By effectively applying
knowledge, individuals might make fewer mistakes or improve
their efficiency and reduce redundancy (Grant, 1996; Gold et al.,
2001). Organizations might then ultimately be able to speed new
product development and create more innovative production
processing technologies and administrative systems (Sarin and
McDermott, 2003).

Accordingly, this study proposes that knowledge management
capacity in terms of acquisition, sharing, and application provides
a positive contribution to the firm's innovation performance.
Through effective knowledge management, firms will be able to
transform knowledge into innovative products, services, and
processes, and thus lead to better technical and administrative
innovation outcomes.

Hypothesis 3. Knowledge management capacity relates posi-
tively to innovation performance.

2.5. Mediating effect of knowledge management capacity

The preceding hypotheses link the relationships among strategic
HR practices, knowledge management capacity, and innovation
performance. Implicitly, the discussion suggests that strategic HR
practices affect firms' innovation performance through their
capacities in knowledge management. That is, firms can use a set
of strategic HR practices to cultivate the level of capacity in
knowledge acquisition, sharing, and application, which, in turn,
promote employees' propensity to innovate and enhance their
innovation performance. Thus, this study argues that knowledge
management capacity plays a mediating role in the relationship
between independent variables of strategic HR practices and
dependent variable of innovation performance. Following this line
of reasoning, this study proposes the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 4. Knowledge management capacity mediates the
relationship between strategic human resource practices and
innovation performance.

3. Research methodology

3.1. Data collection and sample

The present study employs a questionnaire survey approach
to collect data for testing the validity of the model and research
hypotheses. Variables in the questionnaire include background

109

information, strategic human resource practices, knowledge
management capacity, and innovation performance. All inde-
pendent and dependent variables require seven-point Likert-
style responses ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly
agree”. The population for the study is the top 5000 Taiwanese
firms listed in the yearbook published by the China Credit
Information Service Incorporation. This study uses a stratified
random sampling method to select 150 firms in each of the five
1000 levels. The authors distribute 750 questionnaires and
request the questionnaires to be completed by top executives
(i.e. Presidents, Vice-Presidents, Directors, or General Man-
agers) who are familiar with the topic of this study. Of the 157
returned questionnaires, 11 are incomplete. The remaining 146
valid and complete questionnaires are for the quantitative
analysis. It represents a useable response rate of 19.47%. This
study checks the possibility of non-response bias by comparing
the characteristics of the respondents to those of the original
sample. The calculated t-statistics for the annual revenue
(t = 0.254, p = 0.800) and the age of the company (t = 0.051,
p = 0.960) and the chi-square test for the industry affiliation of
the company (χ2 = 0.345, p = 0.841) are all statistically insig-
nificant, suggesting that there are no significant differences
between the respondent and non-respondent groups.

Due to the collection of all measures from the same source,
this study uses the Harman one-factor test to examine the
potential problem of common method variance. Significant
common method variance would result if one general factor
accounts for
the majority of covariance in the variables
(Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). A principal factor analysis on
the questionnaire measurement items of this study yields four
factors with eigenvalues greater than one that account for 81.5%
of the total variance, and the first factor accounts for 24.0% for
the variance. Since a single factor does not emerge and one
general factor does not account for most of the variance,
common method bias is unlikely to be a serious problem in the
data (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986).

3.2. Measures

3.2.1. Innovation performance

Following the distinction of previous researches (e.g.,
Damanpour, 1991; Ibarra, 1993), the present study adopts two
dimensions of innovation performance including administrative
and technical
innovation performance. A seven-item scale,
based on the work of Ibarra (1993), reflects the extent to which
firms are satisfied with the achievements in their development
and implementation of
innovation activities. This study
examines the dimensionality of our measures by conducting a
principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation. The
results support two factors of innovation performance that have
eigenvalues greater than 1 and explain 82.17% of the variance,
as shown in Appendix Table A1. Each item loads on its
appropriate factor with primary loadings exceeding 0.81 and
cross-loadings lower than 0.42. The Cronbach's alpha coeffi-
cients in parentheses indicating the internal consistency
reliability of the measures in the two factors are both above
the suggested value of 0.70 (Hair et al., 1998). The adminis-

trative factor includes four items to measure the extent of
responsiveness to environmental changes and the degree of
innovative administration in terms of planning procedures,
process control systems, and integrated mechanisms (α = 0.919).
The technical factor consists of three questions to measure the
extent to which the firm develops new technologies, incorpo-
rates technologies into new products, and facilitates new
processes to improve quality and lower cost (α = 0.896).

3.2.2. Strategic human resource practices

Drawing upon previous researches (e.g., Youndt et al., 1996;
Collins and Clark, 2003; MacDuffie, 1995; Tannenbaum and
Dupuree-Bruno, 1994), this study adapts five aspects, including
staffing,
training, participation, performance appraisal, and
compensation, in the construct of strategic human resource
practices with development of a sixteen-item scale. The study
examines the dimensionality of the measures by conducting a
principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation. The
results support five factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 and
explain 80.56% of the variance, as shown in Appendix Table
A2. Each item loads on its appropriate factor with primary
loadings greater than 0.60, and cross-loading lower than 0.43.
The Cronbach's alpha coefficients in parentheses indicating the
internal consistency reliability of the measures in the five factors
are all above the suggested value of 0.70 (Hair et al., 1998). The
staffing factor consists of three items regarding selectivity in
hiring, selection for expertise and skills, and selection for future
potential (α = 0.815). The training factor includes four items to
indicate the availability of formal training activities, compre-
hensive training policies and programs, training for new hires,
and training for problem-solving ability (α = 0.897). The
participation factor consists of three indicators reflecting the
degree to which firms allow the employees to make decisions;
provide the employees the opportunity to suggest improvements
into their work; and value the voices of
the employees
(α = 0.762). This study uses three items, including develop-
results-based appraisal, and behavior-based
mental
appraisal,
factor
(α = 0.903). The compensation factor includes three items that
address the degree to which there are profit sharing, incentive
pay, and the link between performance and reward (α = 0.934).

focus,

3.2.3. Knowledge management capacity

The knowledge management capacity construct consists of
eight items to indicate the extent of knowledge management
capacity of the firm. This study examines the dimensionality of
the measures by conducting a principal components factor
analysis with varimax rotation. The results support three factors
with eigenvalues greater than 1 and explain 86.12% of the
variance, as shown in Appendix Table A3. According to the
previous studies (e.g. Lin and Lee, 2005; Gold et al., 2001),
these three factors of knowledge management capacity con-
struct are knowledge acquisition, sharing, and application. They
appropriately represent the knowledge management capacity
items, whereby primary loadings exceeding 0.77 and cross-
loading lower than 0.45. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients in
parentheses indicating the internal consistency reliability of the

measures in the three factors are all above the suggested value of
0.70 (Hair et al., 1998). The knowledge acquisition factor
consists of three items, with respondents indicating the extent to
which they obtain knowledge from customers, partners, and
employees (α = 0.908). The knowledge sharing factor is a three-
item scale to reflect the degree to which the knowledge is
openly shared between supervisors and subordinates, between
colleagues, and between units (α = 0.886). The two indicators in
knowledge application factor are the effective management and
utilization of knowledge into practical use (α = 0.919).

3.2.4. Control variables

Firm size and age may influence innovation performance
because different size and age may exhibit different organizational
characteristics and resource deployment. Also, firms in different
industries may behave differently in innovation. Therefore, this
study includes these variables as control variables to measure
potential effects. This study measures firm size as the amount of
annual sales in million NT dollars and calculates firm age as the
number of years from the founding date. Two dummy variables for
the industry type indicate whether a firm belongs to manufacturing
industry (1= yes, 0= no) or high-tech industry (1= yes, 0= no).

4. Analysis and results

This study attempts to understand the relationships among
strategic HR practices, knowledge management capacity, and
innovation performance. Table 1 displays the means, standard
deviations, and correlations of all variables. This study uses
variance inflation factors (VIFs) to examine the effect of
multicollinearity. The values of the VIF associated with the
predictors show a range from 1.24 to 2.70, which fall within
acceptable limits (Hair et al., 1998), suggesting no need for
concern with respect to multicollinearity.

Table 2 presents the results of regression analysis regarding
the effects of strategic HR practices and knowledge manage-
ment capacity on innovation performance. Models 1a and 1b in
Table 2 are the base models that include the control variables.

Table 1
Means, standard deviations, and correlations

Models 2a and 2b capture the direct effects of strategic HR
practices on the dependent variable. They are both significant at
the p b 0.001 level (R2 = 0.62 and 0.58) and explain an additional
55.0% of variance over what the control variables alone explain.
Coefficients of staffing, participation, and performance apprai-
sal are positive and significant for administrative innovation
performance ( p b 0.001, p b 0.05, and p b 0.01, respectively).
Similarly, staffing, participation, and compensation have
positive and significant effects on technical
innovation
performance ( p b 0.01). These findings indicate that firms
would achieve a higher level of innovation performance if they
have well-developed staffing, participation, performance
appraisal, and compensation practices. Accordingly, the results
moderately support Hypothesis 1, which states that strategic HR
practices relate positively to innovation performance.

Table 3 shows the results of regression analyses of the effects
of strategic HR practices on knowledge management capacity.
Models 5a, 5b, and 5c are the base models that
include
the control variables only. Models 6a, 6b, and 6c show the
relationships between strategic HR practices and knowledge
management capacity. These three models are all significant at
the p b 0.001 level (R2 = 0.60, 0.61, and 0.58, respectively) and
explain an additional 51.0, 57.0 and 56.0% of variance over what
the control variables alone explain. Coefficients of staffing
and participation are positive and significant for knowledge
acquisition, sharing, and application ( p b 0.001). Similarly,
training has positive and significant effects on acquisition
( p b 0.05) and application ( p b 0.001). Coefficients of compen-
sation are positive and significant for knowledge sharing
( p b 0.001) and application ( p b 0.05). These findings indicate
that firms would achieve a higher level of knowledge manage-
ment capacity if they seek to attract and select “premium
workers”, invest more in training programs, give employees
more opportunities of participation, and align compensation
system to encourage employees to contribute their knowledge
and expertise. Accordingly,
the results moderately support
Hypothesis 2, which states that strategic HR practices relate
positively to knowledge management capacity.

Next, we examine how knowledge management capacity
affects innovation performance. Models 3a and 3b in Table 2 are
both significant at the p b 0.001 level (R2 = 0.58 and 0.43) and
explain an additional 51.0 and 40.0% of variance over what the
control variables alone explain. The positive and significant
coefficients of knowledge acquisition ( p b 0.001), sharing
( p b 0.001) and application ( p b 0.01) for both administrative
and technical innovation performance suggest that firms would
get a better innovation performance when firms well develop
their knowledge management capacity in acquisition, sharing,
and application. In summary, all three factors of knowledge

management capacity have the expected signs and also have
significant effects on innovation performance. Accordingly, the
results support Hypothesis 3.

The study follows Baron and Kenny's (1986) procedure to
analyze the mediating effect of knowledge management capacity
between strategic HR practices and innovation performance.
The first step is to examine the relationship between independent
variable and the dependent variable. As models 2a and 2b in
Table 2 show, four strategic HR practices factors relate
significantly to innovation performance. The second step is to
examine the effect of the mediator, knowledge management

capacity, on the independent variable, strategic HR practices.
The results of models 6a to 6c of Table 3 indicate that four
strategic HR practices factors have positive and significant
effects on knowledge management capacity. The third step is to
examine the relationship between mediator and the dependent
variable. Models 3a and 3b of Table 2 show that all three
knowledge management capacity factors have significant and
positive effects on innovation performance. The fourth step is to
include the mediator, knowledge management capacity, in the
models to examine whether it reduces the effects of the ante-
cedents to non-significance. As models 4a and 4b in Table 2
show, the coefficients for knowledge management capacity
factors are positive and significant, indicating the direct effect of
knowledge management capacity on innovation performance.
Further, knowledge management capacity significantly reduces
the effects of strategic HR practices factors on the dependent
variable, most of them to non-significance. The findings indicate
that the inclusion of the knowledge management capacity factors
attenuates the relationships between strategic HR practices and
innovation performance. Thus, knowledge management capa-
city plays a mediating role between strategic HR practices and
innovation performance, supporting the mediation effect
in
Hypothesis 4.

5. Discussion and conclusions

This study examines the role of knowledge management
capacity in the relationship between strategic HR practices and
innovation performance. Our results indicate that strategic HR
practices relate positively to knowledge management capacity,
which in turn relate positively to innovation performance. The
findings show support for the mediating effect of knowledge
management capacity on the relationship between strategic HR
practices and innovation performance. Strategic HR practices
work their beneficial effects on innovation performance through
the capacity in knowledge acquisition, sharing, and application.
These findings highlight the critical roles of human resource
management and knowledge management in the process of inno-
vation. The practical implication of the results is that managers
need to actively manage their firm's human capital through variety
of strategic HR practices to stimulate its capability in managing
knowledge acquisition, sharing, and application. Furthermore, a
better level of knowledge management capacity can stimulate
creative and innovative thoughts that may eventually lead to better
innovation performance. To facilitate the link of strategic HR
practices and favorable innovation performance, managers first
need to recognize the importance of knowledge management
capacity. Then they should utilize strategic HR practices to
cultivate a better level of knowledge management capacity which
in turn will result in favorable innovation outcomes.

The findings of this study contribute to the theoretical develop-
ment of a conceptual model for explaining the relationships
among strategic HR practices, knowledge management capacity,
and innovation performance. Few studies in the literature examine
the relationships and this deficiency is serious because of the
increasing importance of innovation. Accordingly, from the
this study builds up the conceptual
knowledge-based view,

model and hypotheses to indicate the mediating role of knowledge
management capacity between strategic HR practices and inno-
vation performance. The second contribution of this study is the
derivation of empirical support for the model's prediction using
data from actual cases. Although prior research recognizes the
importance of human resource management in the innovation
process, but few studies empirically examine the effects (Jiménez-
Jiménez and Sanz-Valle, 2005; Laursen and Foss, 2003). This
study contributes to the literature by empirically examining the
relationships among strategic HR practices, knowledge manage-
ment capacity, and innovation performance. The results prove that
the use of strategic HR practices including staffing, employee
participation, performance appraisal systems, and incentive-based
compensation positively explains the firm's innovation perfor-
mance; however, knowledge management capacity acts as a
mediator to attenuate these positive relationships. Thus, we dem-
onstrate that knowledge management capacity is a mediating
mechanism through which strategic HR practices benefit innova-
tion performance. The findings of this study fill the gap in the
literature that is lack of empirically examining the mediating roles
of knowledge management in the relationships between strategic
HR practices and innovation performance.

This study has some limitations. The first limitation is the
possible endogeneity problem, due to the self-selection behaviors
of the firms, emerging from the fact that not all firms are perfectly
free to do their knowledge management and human resource
practices choices given the particular contingencies they face
(Wooldridge, 2002; Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003). Accord-
ingly, this study addresses the problem as a possible limitation.
Secondly, a problem common to the organizational-level study
concerning whether an individual response can represent the
intended firm-level situations may exist. To alleviate this problem,
this study asks the executives who are familiar with the topic to
complete the questionnaire. However, this problem may still exist
as a limitation of this study. In addition, this study uses self-report
data which may have the possibility of common method variance.
Though the Harman one-factor test does not indicate it to be a
significant problem, the issue may still exist. Future research can
benefit from using objective measures for innovation perfor-
mance that can be independently verified. Fourth, this study did
the t-statistics and chi-square test to verify that the non-response
bias is not a significant issue. However, the low return rate of the
survey is still a potential limitation in this study. In addition, since
this study only investigates Taiwanese firms, potential cultural
limitation may exist and future research can do the empirical work
in different cultural contexts to generalize or modify the concepts.
The last limitation is the use of a cross-sectional research design.
Although the results are consistent with theoretical reasoning, the
cross-sectional design may not rule out causality concerning the
hypothesized relationships. Future research might address this
issue by using longitudinal design in drawing causal inferences.
To conclude, human resources are valuable assets for firms
desiring to achieve superior
innovation and sustainable
competitive advantages. The viewpoints of this study highlight
the crucial importance of the mediating role of knowledge
management capacity when examining the relationship between
strategic HR practices and innovation performance.
