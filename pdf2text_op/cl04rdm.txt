THE IMPORTANCE OF CUSTOMER INPUT 

IN THE DEVELOPMENT 

OF VERY NEW PRODUCTS 

 

 

 

 

 

Abstract 

This research explores the acquisition of customer input and its importance in the 

development of very new products.  Data were gathered on 55 product development 

projects from the computer telephony integration industry – a new industry experiencing 

rapid technological change.  The data were used to test hypotheses concerning the 

relationships between product newness, the importance of customer input in the 

development process, and the use of customer intensive market research methods.  We 

found that the importance of customer input increases with market newness of a product 

up to a point and then drops off for very new products, whereas the importance of 

customer input increases with technological newness of a product without dropping off.  

We also found that the importance of customer input significantly increases the use of 

customer intensive market research methods; whereas, neither market nor technological 

product newness in themselves had much direct effect on research methods. (148 words)

Introduction 

The ability to successfully develop and market innovative new products is critical for 

modern firms, especially those in technology-related businesses.  Most of the research on 

product development agrees that one of the most critical factors in new product 

development is understanding user needs and incorporating them into the new product 

design (Cooper, 1979, Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1987, Rothwell et al, 1974, Zirger and 

Maidique, 1990). 

 

All technology driven firms have organizational processes and infrastructures that 

facilitate the capture of customer requirement information and its integration into the new 

product's design.  Most of these processes and infrastructures, however, are designed for 

products that are in the latter stages of their lifecycle, or are incremental and continuous 

innovations (Eliashberg et al, 1997).  Wind and Mahajan (1997), in their introduction to 

the special issue on new product development of the Journal of Marketing Research, 

point to the lack of research on the topic of radical or discontinuous innovation.  

Although, the literature provides little guidance to managers involved in the development 

of very new products, it appears evident that the development process, including the 

manner in which users are involved, differs markedly from the incremental new product 

development process (O’Connor, 1998). 

 

There is some confusion in the literature as to the appropriate role of customer input in 

the development of very new products.  While von Hippel (1986) proposed that users are 

 
 

3


an important source of new product ideas, others have argued that being too close to 

customers or being ‘customer-led’ may prove detrimental to innovation and firm 

performance (Macdonald, 1995).  These and other studies (Christensen, 1997, Ciccantelli 

and Magidson, 1993, Neale and Corkindale, 1998) form the basis of an ongoing debate in 

the literature about whether customers and users inhibit or stimulate very new product 

ideas (Connor, 1999, Slater and Narver, 1998 and 1999), and if customer input leads only 

to incremental new products. 

 

The objective of the paper is to provide empirical evidence on how the importance of 

customer input in new product development changes with product newness.  The paper’s 

principal contribution is to show that the importance of customer input increases with 

market newness of a product up to a point and then drops off for very new products, 

whereas the importance of customer input increases with technological newness of a 

product without dropping off. 

 

The paper is structured as follows.  We first review the literature on customer 

involvement in the development of very new products and formulate a set of hypotheses 

based on this review.  We next outline the research design, including data gathering and 

the measurement of research variables.  After presenting the research results, we 

summarize our findings and draw general conclusions for managers.

The Literature on the Development of Very New Products 

 

von Hippel (1986) maintains that there are ‘lead users’ of products that have useful 

solution data to offer firms interested in developing very new products.  He defines “lead 

users of a novel or enhanced product, process, or service as those who display two 

characteristics with respect to it: they face needs that will be general in the marketplace 

significantly in advance of the bulk of the marketplace; and they are positioned to benefit 

significantly by obtaining a solution to those needs.”  The implication is that lead users 

can be an important source of input into the development of very new products. 

 

Lead users must be selected carefully, however.  If the sales and marketing organizations 

in a firm do not understand that lead users are not just well informed current customers, 

the firm can fail to develop very new products because they are attentive to the needs of 

current customers.  Christensen (1997) outlines how incumbent firms that are attentive to 

the needs of the customers in their 'value network' can fail to recognize that certain 

'disruptive' technologies will eventually allow newer entrants to take over their market. 

 

Hamel and Prahalad (1994) suggest that "customers are notoriously lacking in foresight.”  

Martin (1995) argues that firms should "ignore their customers.”  These assertions build 

on work by previous researchers who found that a marketing orientation "inhibits 

organizations from developing truly breakthrough innovations” (Kohli and Jaworski, 

1990).  On the other hand, Slater and Narver (1998) argue that the traditional marketing 

concept of being “market-oriented” is still very much desirable and should not be 

 
 

5


confused with being “customer-led.”  There is evidence that being “customer-led”, or 

responding to explicit customer needs, impedes innovation.  However, avoiding the 

"tyranny of current markets" (Leonard, 1995) should not come at the expense of a 

market-orientation, or "a long-term commitment to understanding customer needs—both 

expressed and latent" and to developing innovative solutions that produce superior 

customer value. 

 

In their in-depth case analyses of four, well-known discontinuous innovations, Lynn et al. 

(1996) found that not only was the information generated from conventional market 

research techniques not useful to radical innovation projects, it was often misleading.  

They propose that a “probe and learn” process is more suited to highly uncertain, 

radically innovative environments.  Companies developed their products "by probing 

potential markets with early versions of the products, learning from the probes, and 

probing again."  Given that this iterative process is inherently exploratory and 

experimental rather than analytical, the authors point to the need to develop entirely 

different product development processes for discontinuous products. 

 

Song and Montoya-Weiss (1998) examined the new product development practices of 

163 “really new” products and 169 incremental new products.  They defined a really new 

product as “one that: relies on technology never used in the industry before; has an 

impact on or causes significant changes in the whole industry; and is the first of its kind 

and entirely new to the market.”  They used six sets of general new product development 

activities in their analysis: strategic planning, idea development, business and market 

 
 

6


opportunity analysis, technical development, product testing, and product 

commercialization.  They found that working to improve proficiency in business and 

market opportunity analysis to be counterproductive for really new products, but 

profitable for incremental products.  Conversely, they found that proficiency in strategic 

planning activities had a positive effect on the profitability of really new products, but a 

negative effect for incremental products. 

 

Veryzer (1998a) examined the customer research efforts and findings of seven firms 

involved in the development of “discontinuous” new products.  Each of the seven 

projects was rated as low, medium or high on three dimensions of newness: the customer 

or user needs that it satisfied; the technological capabilities that it involved; and the 

thinking and behavior required of the consumer in using the product.  Veryzer observed 

four general phases of product development in the cases studied: concept generation and 

exploration, technical development and design, prototype construction, and 

commercialization.  He found that relatively little formal research was conducted during 

the concept generation and design phase, and that the amount of research conducted 

during the technical development and design phase was also limited.  The prototype 

phase provided the first true opportunity to assess customer reaction to the product, its 

benefits and capabilities, and how it operated.  Customer research during the 

commercialization phase was aimed at refining design and clarifying marketing issues, 

and tended to be more formal even if the same methods where used as in earlier phases.  

Although the sources of innovation were not the focus of his study, Veryzer noted that 

product ideas originated from within the firms rather than coming from customer input. 

 
 

7


 

In a separate but related study, Veryzer (1998b) used findings from eight cases to develop 

a descriptive model of the “discontinuous” product development process.  The products 

were discontinuous in that they all “involved emerging or new technologies developed by 

the firms themselves.”  He concluded that discontinuous product development processes 

should be managed differently than those for incremental products.  For example, 

discontinuous products are difficult for customers to understand or appreciate due to the 

break in logical product evolution that they involve.  As a result, early design and 

prototyping that often precede market analyses are an essential part of the early phase of 

the discontinuous new product development process. 

 

O’Connor (1998) describes findings from case studies of eight “discontinuous” 

innovation projects.  She defines a discontinuous innovation as “a product or process 

either with unprecedented performance features or fivefold to tenfold improvements in 

performance or cost.”  Her case study data suggested that the market-related questions 

that are asked during a discontinuous innovation project differ by stage of development, 

and that they differ from the questions that project teams typically ask during an 

incremental new product development effort. 

 

O’Connor was also involved in a more recent study using similar case studies (Rice, 

Kelley, Peters and O’Connor, 2001) that addresses the gap between technical insight by 

technologists and opportunity recognition by managers for radical innovations.  The 

authors develop a framework for bridging this gap that encompasses the radicalness of 

 
 

8


the technology involved together with the technology capabilities of the company, market 

related issues and corporate strategy issues.  The framework calls for judgments on 

effects that the innovation can have on the external market and on its congruence with the 

company’s capabilities and strategy  

 

A variety of terms are used in the literature to describe products that are not incremental 

developments: radical, discontinuous, really new, and very new.  Garcia and Calantone 

(2002) try to clarify this issue by arguing for a category of product newness they call 

“really new” lying between incremental and radical.  They also argue for both macro 

(new to the world, the market or an industry) and micro (new to the firm or customer) 

perspectives.  They state the following: 

“Radical innovations are innovations that cause marketing and technological 

discontinuities on both a macro and micro level.  Incremental innovations occur only 

at a micro level and cause either a marketing or technological discontinuity but not 

both.  Really new innovations cover the combinations in between these two 

extremes.” 

We agree with their distinction between micro and macro, and the need for a class of 

innovation between incremental and radical.  We do not find their definition of “really 

new” innovations helpful, however, because it remains anchored on the idea of 

discontinuity making it very hard to operationalize. 

 

We use the term ‘very new.’  The terms “radical” and “discontinuous” have a binary 

connotation—i.e., whether a new product is either radical or it is not—that can artificially 

 
 

9


generate controversy.  The term ‘very new’ recognizes this fact and allows a more 

dispassionate perspective.  There are degrees of newness that we attempt to capture using 

7-point Likert scales. 

 

Danneels and Kleinschmidt (2001) show marketing and technological fit to be better 

predictors of new product performance than technology or market newness (what they 

call familiarity).  However, our focus is on how firms manage their interface with 

customers when developing new products.  As a result we use a “newness to the firm” 

perspective in measuring product newness.   

 

Tidd and Bodley (2002) reinforce this point when they state that “what matters to 

practicing managers is how close a project is to their existing skills and past experience.”  

In summary, our approach to product newness is based on a continuum of newness 

between incremental and radical that focuses on newness to the firm developing the 

product. 

 

 

Research hypotheses 

 
Our review of the literature highlights the controversy around the importance of customer 

input in the development of very new products.  Understanding user needs and 

incorporating them is critical for product success (Cooper, 1979, Cooper and 

Kleinschmidt, 1987, Rothwell et al, 1974, Zirger and Maidique, 1990).  On the other 

hand, the importance of customer input in the development of very new products has 

 
 

10


been questioned (Christensen, 1997, Hamel and Prahalad, 1994, Leonard, 1995, Martin, 

1995, Veryzer, 1998b). 

 

To guide our research we formed three testable hypotheses.  The first hypothesis deals 

with the relationship between product newness and the importance of customer input.  

The logic for this first hypothesis is the following.  When the product being developed is 

one that is familiar to the developing company, customer input should be less important.  

As the level of product newness increases, the importance of customer input should 

increase.  Beyond a certain point, however, the product being developed can be so new 

that customers have less relevant and reliable information to provide the firm.  Thus our 

first hypothesis is: 

 
H1: The importance of customer input increases with product newness to a certain level 

and then decreases for very new products.   

 

This hypothesis has an analogue in the task complexity literature.  Schroder et al (1967) 

hypothesized that the amount of information processing appropriate to carry out a task 

increases with the complexity of the task up to a certain point and then decreases.  This 

model still has currency in the literature (Campbell, 1988).  Product newness is analogous 

to task complexity; using customer input involves information processing.  Developing 

new products is a more complex task than developing incremental products.  Using 

customer input in the product development process requires extensive information 

processing – increasingly so for products very new to the company. 

 

 
 

11


It also seemed likely to us that when customer input is very important, the company will 

be more likely to use methods for gathering customer input that are based on intense 

interaction with customers.  When customer input is not critical, methods such as in-

house product demos and customer surveys may suffice.  Customer intensive research 

methods such as co-development of the product with customers would likely be used 

more when customer input is vital.  Thus our second hypothesis is: 

 

H2: The customer intensity of the market research methods used increases with the 

importance of customer input in new product development. 

 

Our literature review also highlights the fact that market research for very new products 

is different than that for incremental products (O’Connor, 1998, Veryzer, 1998a).  

Companies developing incremental products should be able to specify with some 

certainty what the customer related issues are, and as a result what customer inputs they 

require.  They know what kinds of questions to ask, of whom to ask them, and what kind 

of responses they are likely to receive.  Thus these companies should be able to gather 

these inputs without the intensive involvement of customers.  As product newness 

increases, what the issues are and what customer inputs are required to resolve them 

become less clear.  Intensive interaction with customers would become more appropriate.  

Thus our third hypothesis is: 

 

H3: The customer intensity of the market research methods used increases with product 

newness. 

 
 

12


 

We did not expect that the customer intensity of market research methods used would 

decrease for very new products.  The rationale for this was that if the product is very new, 

the developing firm would want a close and effective connection with any customer 

actually involved in the development process. 

 

The relationship among the three hypotheses is shown in Figure 1:

Three Hypotheses 

(appears about here) 

Research Design 

Data collection 

 
Preliminary interviews were conducted with managers responsible for product 

development at three firms developing computer telephony integration (CTI) products.  

These firms included one large multibillion-dollar company, a mid-sized vendor, and a 

smaller, relatively new firm.   

 

The study's sampling frame consisted of 537 computer telephony equipment 

manufacturers and software developers.  The list was compiled from the CTI Magazine 

 
 

13


directory of firms for 1998-1999.  A sample of 128 firms was randomly selected from the 

directory. 

 

The CTI industry was chosen as the sampling frame because innovation was occurring at 

a very rapid pace in this field.  The growth of the Internet had dramatically altered user 

requirements for telecommunications products as well as the competitive landscape of the 

telecom industry.  As voice and data communications converged on Internet Protocol (IP) 

networks, traditional telephony vendors commenced supplying data communications 

capabilities, Internet-enabled products and web integration to their customers.  Most CTI 

products developed just prior to the study period were first generation products 

incorporating new-to-the-world technology.  The relative newness of the Internet, the 

speed at which it is growing, and the pace of technological evolution made the CTI 

industry a good source of very new product development projects. 

 

The unit of analysis was a computer telephony new product development project.  Senior 

managers responsible for new product development at the 128 firms were contacted and 

asked to participate in the study.  Thirty firms were disqualified either because they 

refused to participate in the study or because they were subsidiaries of foreign companies 

and product development projects were managed in their home countries. 

 

Managers agreeing to participate in the study were sent the questionnaire by fax or e-

mail.  In all, 98 questionnaires were sent.  23 respondents returned the questionnaires by 

 
 

14


fax or e-mail.  Another 32 questionnaires were completed over the telephone for a total of 

55 usable questionnaires—a response rate of 55/96 or 56 percent. 

 

Product newness 

 
McDermott (1998) highlighted the need to use two dimensions of product discontinuity 

or innovativeness: technology newness and market newness.  Given our focus on how 

firms manage their interface with customers when developing new products, we use a 

“newness to the firm” perspective in measuring product newness.  Therefore, we 

measured product newness with five questions relating to technological and market 

issues.  Respondents answered the questions on a seven-point Likert scale.  The average 

of these five questions was used to form an overall newness measure for a product.  The 

average responses for the first two questions constituted a market newness measure: 

-  How new (to your company) were the customers targeted by the new product?  

-  How new (to your company) were the user needs addressed by the new product?  

The average responses for the last three questions constituted a tech newness measure: 

-  How new (to your company) was the technology embodied in the new product? 

-  How new (to your company) was the product architecture? 

-  How new (to your company) were the core components or software modules in the 

new product?  

 

Lee and O’Connor (2003) call for measures that encompass both product newness to the 

firm and impact on consumer consumption behaviors.  We do not gather data directly on 

 
 

15


impact on consumption behaviors but the answers to our market newness questions do 

address this issue indirectly. 

 

Product development activities 

 
It is common to use development stages in research on product development.  Eisenhardt 

and Tabrizi (1995) divided development projects into five stages: predevelopment, 

conceptual design, product design, testing, process development, and production start-up.  

Because of the iterative nature of software development processes (Boehm, 1988), 

however, it is difficult to determine in what “stage” a software development project is at 

any given time.  Therefore, we moved away from dividing the development process into 

stages.  Rather, we identified five major activities of software product development the 

first four of which can be carried out iteratively for any given product development and 

may overlap: 

1.  idea generation and screening—the generation of product concepts and their 

evaluation for technical feasibility and likelihood of market success; 

2.  requirements definition and design specification--the determination of the commercial 

(i.e., customer) requirements for the product together with its functional specification; 

3.  technical development--the definition of the product design at the level of the 

modules to be used and their interdependencies together with the creation of the 

source code for the software product in whatever languages that are used; 

4.  trials and testing-- the internal, laboratory based system testing of versions of the 

entire product and the testing of pre-release versions of the product by end 

users/customers often at their sites; 

 
 

16


5.  product launch—the release of the product into the market, marketing and promotion 

and the commencement of sales to customers. 

 

These five activities are consistent with the stage models reviewed by Tidd and Bodley 

(2002) and are consistent with our understanding of software intensive product 

development processes both from this and previous research (Callahan and Moretton 

2001). 

 

Customer input 

 
Respondents were asked to rate the importance of the input of potential end-users of the 

product during each of the five major activities of the product development process on a 

seven-point Likert scale.  The questions were of the following form:  

- How important was the input provided by potential end-users of the product during idea 

generation and screening activities? 

We averaged these five measures to get end-user input. 

 

Respondents were also asked to rate the importance of the input of other customer 

personnel during each of the five major activities in the development process.  These 

other individuals were described to respondents as IT or technical support personnel, key 

decision-makers, buyers or influencers of the buying decision at potential customer firms.  

Most of the products in our CTI sample are sold to companies in which there are many 

types of customers besides end-users from whom input can be important.  We also 

averaged these five measures to get other customer input. 

 
 

17


 

Customer intensity of market research methods 

 
Respondents also specified the various market research methods used during each 

activity of the development process.  The extent of the use of customer-intensive market 

research methods during each of the five major activities in the product development 

process were measured by assigning scores to the different methods based on the extent 

of customer involvement that they require.  The following method intensity scale was 

used: 

0: in-house demos, and technological forecasting 

1: customer surveys 

2: focus/discussion groups, and user group feedback 

3: alpha/beta site testing, customer site visits, and direct observation of users 

4: co-development 

 

Total scores for each activity were then summed in order to derive a measure of method 

intensity during each of the five activities in the product development process.  We also 

averaged these five measures to get method intensity. 

 

We found respondents to our questionnaire very confused as to the true meaning of “lead 

user analysis.”  As a result, our data on the use of lead users was left out of our analysis.  

Those respondents who indicated that they used lead user analysis in product 

development were prompted to explain what they meant by lead users.  von Hippel 

(1986) describes lead user analysis as a method for seeking out users that face needs well 

 
 

18


in advance of the general marketplace and using these users to generate ideas for new 

products.  Respondents provided very different explanations for what they meant by lead 

user analysis.  The majority of respondents thought of lead user analysis as a method for 

testing new products with a group of early adopter customers and not lead customers as 

defined by von Hippel.  Therefore, it was decided not to include this item due to the 

ambiguity of the concept for respondents and the consequent lack of consistency in 

responses. 

 

 

 

Sample characteristics 

Results 

 
In the sample, product development project durations ranged from 2.5 to 36 months with 

a mean of 12.8 months; total budgets from $10,000 to $25 million with a mean of $2.3 

million.  Given that the sample included a very broad cross-section of firms in terms of 

size and product category as well as a wide range of different products based on cost and 

length of development, we argue that the results are representative of the computer 

telephony industry in 1999. 

 

Complete descriptive statistics on project duration and budget, product newness, 

importance of customer input and market research method intensity are contained in 

Table A1 in the Statistical Appendix.  It can be noted there that the importance of 

customer input was lowest during technical development.  Method intensity is also low 

 
 

19


during this activity.  The importance of customer input was high during trials and testing; 

method intensity was also highest during this activity. 

 

 

Testing the hypotheses 

 
Hypothesis 1 – the importance of customer input increases with product newness to a 

certain level and then decreases for very new products. 

We first tested for a linear relationship between newness and the importance of customer 

input.  As shown in Table 1, end-user input has significant linear relationships with 

overall newness and technological newness, but not with market newness.  There are 

significant linear relationships between other customer input and all three measures of 

newness. 

 

 

Table 1 

Correlations between importance of customer input 

and product newness 

(appears about here) 

We then used quadratic regression to test hypothesis 1 further.  The quadratic regression 

specification of the hypothesis is that: 

importance of customer input = α + β1(newness) + β2(newness)2 + ε 

with β1 > 0 and β2 < 0, 

 
 

20


and that the importance of customer input reaches a peak when newness is less than the 

maximum of 7. 

 

Table 2 shows the results of three quadratic regressions.  The dependent variable in each 

regression is end-user input.  The independent variables are overall newness, market 

newness and technological newness respectively.  The estimates of β1 and β2 have the 

hypothesized sign in each case.  The regressions using overall newness and market 

newness produce significant estimates for β1 and β2.  Note that the estimates for β1 and β2 

are not significant when technological newness is used as the independent variable in the 

regression. 

 

 

Table 2 

Results of quadratic regression analysis:  

importance of end-user input averaged over all activities against product newness 

(appears about here) 

These results indicate that there is a quadratic relationship between end-user input and 

overall newness, but that the quadratic nature of the relationship comes from market 

newness not from tech newness.  When other-customer input is used as the dependent 

variable, none of the quadratic regression results are significant. 

 

The best-fit quadratic equation for the first regression – end-user input against overall 

newness – is: 

 
 

21


end-user input = constant + 1.92(overall newness) – 0.16(overall newness)2 

The slope of the equation is then 1.92 – 0.16(2)(overall newness).  When overall newness 

is at its maximum value of 7, this slope takes the value 1.92 – 0.16(2)(7) = -0.32.  The 

negative slope of the relationship between end-user input and overall newness, at high 

levels of overall newness, supports hypothesis 1. 

 

These quadratic regression results are supported by correlations on split samples.  For the 

eight products with overall newness greater than 6.0, the correlation between end-user 

input and overall newness is significantly negative: –0.67*.  For the rest of the sample the 

corresponding correlation is significantly positive: +0.37**. 

 

A fuller set of correlation and quadratic regression results broken out by development 

process activity is contained in Tables A2, A3, A4 and A5 of the Statistical Appendix.  

The more detailed results are consistent with those just described. 

 

Hypothesis 2 – the customer intensity of the market research methods used increases with 

the importance of customer input in new product development. 

We tested hypothesis 2 using correlation analysis.  The correlations between end-user 

and method intensity is .46***.  The correlation between other customer and method 

intensity is .36**. 

 

More complete correlation data for each of the five development activities is contained in 

Table A6 in the Statistical Appendix.  During idea generation and screening, there is no 

 
 

22


significant linear relationship between importance of customer input (end-user input or 

other customer input) and method intensity.  During requirements definition, trials and 

testing, and product launch, there are significant correlations between method intensity 

and end-user input, but not with other customer input.  The result is just the opposite for 

the technical development activity: during technical development, there is a significant 

correlation between method intensity and other customer but not with end-user. 

 

These correlations provide some support for hypothesis 2. 

 

Hypothesis 3 – the customer intensity of the market research methods used increases with 

product newness. 

We also used correlation analysis to test hypothesis 3.  As can be seen in Table 3, there 

are significant positive correlations between method intensity and the three measures of 

product newness.  Path analysis based on the relationship between the three hypotheses 

shown in Figure 1, however, suggests using partial correlations to control for end-user 

input.  The partial correlations, also shown in Table 3, show less direct support for 

hypothesis 3.   

 

 

 
 

Table 3 

Correlations and partial correlations between newness and method intensity 

(appears about here) 

23


In the more detailed results provided in Table A7 and A8 in the Statistical Appendix, 

there are strong partial correlations between method intensity and overall newness in idea 

generation and screening, and between method intensity and market newness and in 

technical development. 

 

These results provide weak support for hypothesis 3.

There is strong support for hypothesis 1 – that the importance of customer input increases 

with product newness to a certain level and then decreases for very new products.  

Correlation analysis and quadratic regression showed that the importance of end-user 

input does increase with overall newness of a product to a company up to a point, and 

that it tends to decrease for high levels of overall newness.  This drop of in the 

importance of customer input also occurs with high levels of market newness but not with 

high levels of technological newness.   

 

There is also support for hypothesis 2 – customer intensity of the market research 

methods used increases with the importance of customer input in new product 

development.  Correlation analysis demonstrated several positive linear relationships 

 
 

24


between measures of the importance of customer input and of the customer intensity of 

the market research methods used. 

 

There was less support in the data for hypothesis 3 – customer intensity of the market 

research methods used increases with product newness in the data.  Partial correlation 

analysis showed that the relationship between product newness and the customer 

intensity of the market research methods used demonstrated through correlation analysis, 

was mostly an indirect effect through the importance of customer input. 

 

There are also results particular to each of the five major activities that are worth noting: 

Idea generation and screening 

In idea generation and screening, the importance of customer input is relatively high 

but not correlated with product newness.  There is a strong positive relationship, 

however, between overall newness and method intensity during this activity. 

Requirements definition 

During requirements definition and design specification, the importance of end-user 

input and product technical newness are strongly correlated.  The importance of end-

user input is also strongly correlated with market research method intensity. 

Technical development 

The importance of customer input is low during technical development, as is method 

intensity.  When the sample is split into low and high levels of product newness, the 

importance of customer input during technical development is positively correlated 

with product newness for lower levels of product newness.  At very high levels of 

 
 

25


product newness, the importance of customer input during technical development is 

negatively correlated with product newness.  As well, there is a strong positive 

relationship between market newness and method intensity, and a strong correlation 

between the importance of other customer input and method intensity for this activity. 

Trials and testing 

During trials and testing, both the importance of customer input and method intensity 

are high, and there is a strong positive relationship between market newness and the 

importance of customer input.  There is also a strong correlation between the 

importance of end-user input and method intensity. 

Product launch 

During product launch, there is a significant quadratic relationship between the 

importance of end-user input and overall and market newness.  There is again a 

strong correlation between the importance of end-user input and method intensity. 

 

The sample 

Before considering the managerial consequences of the results, we should first review the 

nature of the sample and how this influenced the results.  The sample projects are drawn 

from the computer telephony industry.  35% of the sample involved pure software 

products.  Over 80% of the sample involved at least 50% software.  The results are 

heavily influenced by software development.  It can be argued that software development 

is different from the development of physical products.  For example, software design is 

“in the code” – it is not visible.  This makes it hard to use software design as a focal point 

for involving customers in the development process and capturing requirements.  These 

 
 

26


differences may restrict the applicability of the results of this research.  On the other 

hand, software products are of ever increasing importance in the economy.  Many 

physical products, automobiles and home appliances as well as electronic products for 

example, have significant software components. 

 

Many products included in our research sample would not be considered ‘radical’ by 

O’Connor (1998), ‘discontinuous’ by Veryzer (1998a, 1998b) or ‘really new’ by Song 

and Montoy-Weiss (1998).  The newest products in the sample are, however, ‘very new’.  

They are drawn from an industry noted for its rapid innovation, and rated as very new by 

manager respondents. 

 

Consider a conclusion drawn by Veryzer (1998b) in his study of eight discontinuous 

product development projects.  He postulated the existence of a dynamic drifting phase at 

the front end of discontinuous development – dynamic drifting referring to technical 

exploration in R&D labs often undertaken separately in independent research programs.  

There was little “dynamic drifting” in our sample projects.  The average product 

development duration in the sample was 12.8 months; the longest was 36 months.  The 

dynamic drifting described by Veryzer is not typical of software based development 

projects. 

 

Managerial implications 

 

 
 

27


Firstly, in our data the importance of end-user input in product development increases up 

to a certain point but then decreases for products that are very new to the company 

developing them.  This goes some way to clarifying the managerial controversy outlined 

in our literature review.  Managers do seem to place more importance on end-user input 

as the level of newness of the product to the developing company increase, but only up to 

a certain point.  When the newness of the product to the company increases beyond a 

certain point, however, the importance that they place on end-user input drops off.  This 

result is consistent with the “probe and learn” strategy found by Lynn et al. (1996) in 

their study of four cases of “discontinuous innovation.”  Using a “probe and learn” 

strategy, the case study firms brought initial products to market in order to subsequently 

learn from customer reactions.  The initial product was regarded as the first step in a 

longer process of development.  Although the case study firms in each case employed 

conventional marketing techniques, the “techniques proved to be of limited utility, were 

often ignored, and in hindsight were sometimes strikingly inaccurate.” 

 

Figure 2 shows this curvilinear relationship between the importance of customer input 

and product newness for the whole range of newness: from incremental, through very 

new to radical.  We believe that our sample of very new products has captured how the 

importance of customer input starts to drop off for products very new to the developing 

company.

(appears about here) 

 

Secondly, market newness of a product (the newness to the company of the customers 

targeted and customer needs addressed) and technological newness of a product (newness 

to the company of technology embodied, product architecture and core components) 

affect the importance of customer input in different ways.  The importance of end-user 

input drops off when market newness is very high.  This drop-off does not occur with 

technical newness.  Moreover, use of customer intensive research methods is related to 

market and technological newness in different ways.  For example, it is market newness 

not technical newness that leads to the use of customer intensive research methods during 

technical development activities. 

 

Thirdly, both the importance of customer input and the use of customer intensive research 

methods vary over the major activities of product development.  The importance of both 

end-user and other customer input is lowest during technical development activities and 

high before and after.  Customer intensive research methods are most used during trials 

and testing and least used during technical development. 

 

Lastly, the importance of the input of end-users and other customers are affected 

differently by product newness.  In particular, the importance of end-user customer input 

 
 

29


decreases for very new products whereas the importance of other customer input does 

not.
