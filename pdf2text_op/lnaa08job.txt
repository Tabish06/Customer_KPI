 Summary

 Although the value of a supportive organizational climate has been recognized over the years,
 there is a need for better understanding of its relationship with employee outcomes. This study
 investigates whether the recently emerging core construct of positive psychological capital
 (consisting of hope, resilience, optimism, and efficacy) plays a role in mediating the effects of a
 supportive organizational climate with employee outcomes. Utilizing three diverse samples,
 results show that employees' psychological capital is positively related to their performance,
 satisfaction, and commitment and a supportive climate is related to employees' satisfaction
 and commitment. The study's major hypothesis that employees' psychological capital
 mediates the relationship between supportive climate and their performance was also
 supported. The implications of these findings conclude the article. Copyright C) 2008 John

 Introduction

 The thesis of Tom Friedman's (2005) best-selling book "The World is Flat" is that "it is now possible
 for more people than ever to collaborate and compete in real-time with more other people on more
 different kinds of work from more different corners of the planet and on a more equal footing than at
 any previous time in the history of the world" (p. 8). Such a new paradigm environment has too often
 driven today's organizations to compete and even survive on the basis of cutting price and costs through

 reengineering processes and downsizing the number of employees. These stop-gap measures have
 about run their course in Friedman's so-called "flat world" competition. New thinking and new
 approaches have become necessary for organizations to survive and to create sustainable growth and
 development. As the Chairman and CEO of The Gallup Organization, Jim Clifton, noted "in the new
 world of extreme competition, we are all going down the wrong path unless we discover a new way to
 manage" (Coffman & Gonzalez-Molina, 2002, p. xii).

 The purpose of this article is to propose not only the importance of a supportive organizational
 climate to counter the negatively oriented downsizing of recent years, but also the importance of
 understanding a recently proposed positive perspective and strategy to human resource development
 and managing for performance impact called psychological capital, or simply, PsyCap (Luthans,
 Avolio, Avey, & Norman, 2007; Luthans, Luthans, & Luthans, 2004; Luthans & Youssef, 2004;
 Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007). In endorsing the recent book on Psychological Capital (Luthans,
 Youssef et al., 2007), organizational behavior scholar Denise Rousseau states that it "shows how recent
 breakthroughs in the positive psychology movement can translate into benefits for companies,
 managers, and workers." In order to derive the study hypotheses, we first present the theoretical
 underpinnings of what is meant by this psychological capital and how it may be related to a supportive
 organizational climate for employee performance impact.

 The Meaning of Positive Organizational Behavior

 Positive organizational behavior (Luthans, 2002a, 2002b, 2003; Luthans & Youssef, 2007; also see
 Nelson & Cooper, 2007; Wright, 2003) and its derivative psychological capital or PsyCap (Luthans,
 Avolio, et al., 2007; Luthans et al., 2004; Luthans & Youssef, 2004; Luthans, Youssef et al., 2007) is
 largely drawn from the theory and research in positive psychology (Peterson & Seligman, 2004;
 Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; Sheldon & King, 2001; Snyder & Lopez, 2002) applied to the
 workplace (Luthans & Youssef, in press). Simply put, positive psychology is concerned with people's
 strengths (rather than weaknesses and dysfunctions) and how they can grow and thrive (rather than be
 fixed or maintained). Positive psychology does not claim to have discovered the value of positivity, but
 rather the intent is to simply shift to a more balanced focus of understanding and developing what is
 also right with people and how they can thrive.

 Positive organizational behavior, or simply POB, takes positive psychology to the workplace

 (Luthans, 2002a, 2002b, 2003; Luthans & Youssef, 2007, in press). More specifically, POB is defined as
 "the study and application of positively oriented human resource strengths and psychological
 capacities that can be measured, developed, and effectively managed for performance improvement in
 today's workplace" (Luthans, 2002b, p. 59). Thus defined, POB has very specific inclusion criteria. To
 be included in POB, the construct must not only be a positive strength or psychological capacity, but
 also must be grounded in theory and research, have valid measures, and perhaps most importantly for
 differentiating from other positively oriented constructs found in the organizational behavior field over
 the years, must be state-like (as opposed to trait-like) and therefore open to development and
 management for performance improvement (Luthans, 2002a, 2002b; Luthans & Youssef, 2007;
 Luthans, Youssef et al., 2007).

 These definitional criteria differentiate what we mean by POB from the popular positively oriented

 self-development books and the widely recognized largely trait-based positive constructs (such as
 positive affectivity, conscientiousness, self-esteem, or core self-evaluations) and the University of

 SUPPORTIVE CLIMATE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL 221

 Michigan's research group's work on more macro-oriented positive organizational scholarship
 (Cameron & Caza, 2004; Cameron, Dutton, & Quinn, 2003; Roberts, 2006). Though there is some
 overlap with this complementary work, POB is mainly different in its "state-like" malleability and
 focus on performance impact at a more micro-level. For example, in making the distinction between
 POB and POS Nelson and Cooper (2007, pp. 3-4) note that "Luthans recommended that POB
 researchers study psychological states (italics added) that could be validly measured, and that are
 malleable in terms of interventions in organizations to improve work performance," whereas "the POS
 movement seeks to understand human excellence and exceptional organizational performance."
 Therefore, as defined here, POB is a specific positive approach with implications for human resource
 development and performance management.

 To date, the positive psychological constructs that have been determined to best meet the POB

 criteria are hope, resiliency, optimism, and self-efficacy (Luthans, 2002a; Luthans et al., 2004; Luthans
 & Youssef, 2004; Luthans & Youssef, 2007; Luthans, Youssef et al., 2007). However, it should be noted
 that other positive psychological constructs could and likely will be included in the future. Some
 representative examples include positive concepts such as work engagement (Schaufeli & Bakker,
 2004; Schaufeli & Salanova, 2007), psychological well-being (Wright & Cropanzano, 2000, 2004),
 psychological ownership (Avey, Avolio, Crossley, & Luthans, in press), wisdom, courage, and
 forgiveness (e.g., see Luthans, Youssef et al., 2007, Chapters 6 and 7), and Peterson and Seligman
 (2004) discuss a variety of positive virtues that could also meet the POB criteria to varying degrees.
 However, the four identified for this study have been determined to best meet the POB inclusion criteria
 at this time and also theoretically and empirically have been shown to make up the core construct of
 psychological capital (Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007).

 Hope as a positive psychological strength

 Hope is widely used in every day language, but as examined here is most closely associated with the
 theory and research of positive psychologist C. Rick Snyder. Snyder and colleagues' hope theory
 (Snyder, Sympson, Ybasco, Borders, Babyak, & Higgins, 1996; Snyder, 2000, 2002) is widely
 recognized in clinical and positive psychology and has considerable research support. Snyder and his
 colleagues have specifically defined hope as a "positive motivational state that is based on an
 interactively derived sense of successful (1) agency (goal directed energy) and (2) pathways (planning
 to meet goals)" (Snyder et al., 1996). Thus, hope can be viewed as consisting of three distinct but
 complementary components: agency (will-power), pathways (way-power), and goals.

 The agency component of hope can be viewed as being the will to accomplish a specific task or goal

 (Snyder et al., 1996). Thus, agency includes the motivation or goal-directed energy to succeed at a
 given task in a specific context. The pathway component is viewed as being the means to accomplish a
 task or goal. Thus, a pathway is considered to be the way to accomplish a task or goal. Together, they
 form the will and the way to accomplish a given task or goal. Snyder and colleagues' theory and
 research suggest having one component by itself is not sufficient. To possess hope as defined and
 operationalized, one must have both the will to succeed in a given task, as well as a viable means, or
 way to accomplish that task.

 In clinical and positive psychology, hope has been clearly linked to academic and athletic success

 (Snyder, 2000, 2002), but only recently has it been analyzed in the workplace. In preliminary research
 in the workplace, hope has been found to be related to Chinese factory workers' supervisory rated
 performance (Luthans, Avolio, Walumbwa, & Li, 2005), unit financial performance and employee
 satisfaction and retention (Peterson & Luthans, 2003), and employee performance, satisfaction,
 happiness, and commitment (Youssef & Luthans, 2007).

 Resilience as a positive psychological strength

 Resilience theory and research is largely drawn from clinical psychology's work with adolescent
 children that have succeeded despite great adversity (Masten, 2001; Masten & Reed, 2002). Resilience
 is often characterized by positive coping and adaptation in the face of significant adversity or risk
 (Masten & Reed, 2002). As adapted to the workplace, resiliency has been defined as the "positive
 psychological capacity to rebound, to 'bounce back' from adversity, uncertainty, conflict, failure, or
 even positive change, progress and increased responsibility" (Luthans, 2002a, p. 702). Therefore,
 resilience can be characterized by coping responses not only to adverse events, but also to extreme
 positive events as well.

 As with hope, to date research on resilience has been mainly limited to clinical and positive
 psychology. However, similar to the focus on hope, preliminary research has begun to examine the
 impact of resiliency in the workplace. For example, a significant relationship was found between the
 resiliency of Chinese factory workers undergoing significant change and transformation and their
 supervisory rated performance (Luthans et al., 2005). Resiliency has also been found to be related to
 work attitudes of satisfaction, happiness, and commitment (Youssef & Luthans, 2007).

 Optimism as a positive psychological strength

 The theoretical foundation for optimism as a POB strength is largely drawn from the discussions of
 positive psychologist Martin Seligman (1998). Specifically, he defines optimism as making an internal,
 relatively stable, and global attribution regarding positive events such as goal achievement, and an
 external, relatively unstable, and specific cause for negative events like a failed attempt at reaching a
 goal. To avoid the criticism of false optimism, POB tends to emphasize realistic optimism (Luthans,
 2002b; Luthans, Youssef et al., 2007; Schneider, 2001). In other words, optimism is not based on an
 unchecked process that has no realistic assessment. This realistic optimism as a state (as opposed to a
 dispositional trait), includes an objective assessment of what one can accomplish in a specific situation,
 given the available resources at that time, and therefore can vary (see Peterson, 2000).

 Similar to the other positive psychological capacities, empirical research on optimism in the
 workplace is just emerging. Seligman (1998) did find that optimism was significantly and positively
 related to the performance of insurance sales agents. In addition, in the study of the Chinese factory
 workers mentioned previously by Luthans et al. (2005), optimism was also found to have a significant
 relationship with rated performance. The study by Youssef and Luthans (2007) found employees'
 optimism related to their performance, satisfaction, and happiness.

 Efficacy as a positive psychological strength

 Meeting the POB criteria perhaps better than any other capacity is self-efficacy. This positive construct
 is based on the comprehensive theory and extensive research of Bandura (1997) with recent emphasis to
 linking this construct to positive psychology (Bandura, 2007). Applied to the workplace, Stajkovic and
 Luthans (1998) defined efficacy as the individual's conviction (or confidence) about his or her abilities
 to mobilize the motivation, cognitive resources, and courses of action needed to successfully execute a
 specific task within a given context. In a meta-analysis consisting of 114 studies, they found a strong
 positive relationship between self-efficacy and work-related performance (Stajkovic & Luthans, 1998).

 SUPPORTIVE CLIMATE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL 223

 Particularly relevant to the POB developmental criterion, Bandura (1997) has clearly shown that

 self-efficacy can be enhanced in four very specific ways. First, efficacy is developed when an employee
 experiences success (task mastery). Second, employees' efficacy can be developed when they
 vicariously learn how to do something by observing others (i.e., modeling) in their relevant comparison
 group accomplish a task and be rewarded. Third, efficacy is developed when being persuaded by or
 receiving positive feedback from respected others. Fourth, efficacy is developed and enhanced through
 physiological and/or psychological arousal and wellness.

 Psychological Capital

 Law, Wong, and Mobley (1998) provided a conceptual framework for determining how
 multidimensional constructs can relate to a core factor. The "latent model" they describe characterizes
 what we refer to as psychological capital (PsyCap) in that we have specified a higher-level, core
 construct that underlies the four dimensions of hope, resilience, optimism, and efficacy. The
 higher-order core construct of PsyCap represents the commonality among the four component
 dimensions and as noted has both conceptual (Luthans et al., 2004; Luthans & Youssef, 2004; Luthans,
 Youssef et al., 2007) and empirical (Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007) support.

 Very simply, PsyCap can be viewed as "who you are" and "what you can become in terms
 of positive development" (Avolio & Luthans, 2006) and is differentiated from human capital ("what
 you know"), social capital ("who you know"), and financial capital ("what you have") (Luthans
 et al., 2004). PsyCap has been specifically defined as "an individual's positive psychological state
 of development that is characterized by: (1) having confidence (self-efficacy) to take on and put in
 the necessary effort to succeed at challenging tasks; (2) making a positive attribution (optimism)
 about succeeding now and in the future; (3) persevering toward goals and, when necessary,
 redirecting paths to goals (hope) in order to succeed; and (4) when beset by problems and
 adversity, sustaining and bouncing back and even beyond (resiliency) to attain success" (Luthans,
 Youssef et al., 2007, p. 3).

 On the surface and as used in everyday language, hope, resiliency, optimism, and efficacy seem very

 similar and interchangeable. However, the positive psychology literature (e.g., Snyder, 2000, 2002;
 Snyder & Lopez, 2002) and POB (e.g., Luthans & Youssef, 2007; Luthans, Youssef et al., 2007) has
 clearly differentiated these positive capacities and empirically based analyses have found discriminant
 validity among them (Bryant & Cvengros, 2004; Carifio & Rhodes, 2002; Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007;
 Magaletta & Oliver, 1999; Youssef & Luthans, 2007). Thus, each of these four positive components has
 been shown to be conceptually and psychometrically distinct.

 By the same token, there is also empirical evidence of convergent validity among them (e.g., Bryant

 & Cvengros, 2004; Carifio & Rhodes, 2002; Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007; Magaletta & Oliver, 1999;
 Youssef & Luthans, 2007). A proposed benefit of combining these similar, yet distinct capacities is that
 they likely share an underlying component or psychological resource (see Hobfoll, 2002 for a
 comprehensive review) that allows for individuals that possess higher levels of these resource
 capacities to perform at consistently higher levels than would be possible with higher levels of just one
 of these components alone (Luthans, Avolio, et al., 2007).

 Another linkage for the theoretical foundation for PsyCap compatible with psychological resource
 theories comes from positive psychologist Fredrickson's (1998, 2001) broaden-and-build theory of
 positive emotions. She has found that basic research on positivity builds out not only intellectual (e.g.,
 problem solving and creativity), physical (e.g., coordination, coping with stress, and cardiovascular

 health), and social (e.g., relationships, networks, and friends) resources, but it is also important to the
 theoretical understanding of PsyCap and what she calls psychological resources (Fredrickson, 2001;
 also see Isen, 1987). Research on positive emotions using this framework has suggested that individuals
 and groups of people operate at more optimal levels of cognitive and emotional functioning when
 reporting higher levels of positive emotions (Fredrickson & Losada, 2005). While emotions studied
 under this framework are distinct from the positive cognitions examined in PsyCap, research suggests a
 strong link between cognitions and emotions (Lazarus, 1993) supporting the underlying premise that
 positivity in general, and positive emotions and cognitions in particular, are likely to help support
 theoretical explanation and better understanding of psychological capital and its impact on
 performance.

 In addition to the theoretical framework, another important requirement for PsyCap is its state-

 like developable capacity. As was brought out in the discussion of each of the four capacities, they are
 all, to varying degrees, demonstrated to be state-like and thus open to change and development. The
 term state-like is deliberately used to recognize that, with the possible exception of efficacy (Bandura,
 1997), each has been treated in the literature as both trait-like, dispositional, as well as state-like,
 developable.

 In proposing that PsyCap is state-like, we draw from Conley (1984) who noted that "self-opinion
 constructs" are more malleable than personality traits or intelligence, but are still relatively stable over
 time. Recent research has also shown that after disattenuating for internal reliability, over time the
 corrected test-retest reliability for trait-like conscientiousness and core self-evaluations had higher
 stability than did the measure for state-like PsyCap (Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007). Thus, drawing from
 this prior research, we are suggesting that PsyCap is "state-like," i.e., moderately stable but not
 dispositional or fixed like personality or core self-evaluation traits and can be changed by experience
 and developed in training.

 Just as each positive capacity has evidence for discriminate and convergent validity it is more

 accurate to treat these four on a trait-state continuum rather than a pure state. Further adding to defining
 these constructs as state-like, there is preliminary evidence that PsyCap can be developed in a short,
 highly focused intervention in a group training session (see Luthans, Avey, Avolio, Norman, & Combs,
 2006) and on-line (Luthans, Avey, & Patera, in press).

 In sum, PsyCap is presented here as an emerging higher order, core construct that organizations can

 invest in and develop in their workforce to achieve veritable, sustained growth and performance.
 Indeed, we are proposing that PsyCap may help provide and contribute to the call for a new perspective
 and approach to managing for competitive advantage in the "flat world" environment. However,
 PsyCap cannot operate in vacuum and this is why we propose that a supportive organizational climate
 may play a role.

 Supportive Organizational Climate

 As pointed out by Luthans and Avolio (2003), both PsyCap and a positive, supportive context are
 needed for human resources to achieve sustainable growth and performance. Over the years, supportive
 climate researchers have taken different paths. Some have considered as an individual performance
 equation, which includes a multiplicative combination of ability, support and effort (Schermerhorn,
 Gardner, & Martin, 1990). That is, employees' performance is the product of their ability, the support
 received to adequately perform their job, and the motivation to perform at high levels. Therefore, one
 key component of employees' performance is the amount of support they receive.

 SUPPORTIVE CLIMATE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL 225

 Another approach is more directly concerned with supportive organizational climate. For example,-
 Mercer and Bilson (1985) reported a positive relationship between supportive organizational climate
 and employee outcomes such as organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Similarly, Rogg,
 Schmidt, Shull, and Schmitt (2001) found that supportive organizational climate was related to desired
 organizational outcomes such as customer satisfaction. Although the Rogg et al. (2001) study was
 conducted at the organizational level rather than at the individual level of analysis as examined here,
 their results offered the initial foundation for follow up studies to examine the impact of a supportive
 organizational climate on other desirable outcomes such as performance, job satisfaction, and
 commitment. In addition, Rogg et al.'s (2001) measure of supportive climate was found to be reliable
 with adequate evidence for construct validity.

 We recognized these varied approaches when examining supportive climate in the current study. For
 example, Eisenberger and colleagues (Eisenberger, Fasolo, & Davis-LaMastro, 1990; Rhoades,
 Eisenberger, & Armeli, 2001) have examined supportive climate in terms of the amount of perceived
 organizational support that one believes is present. Similarly, some theoretical models assert that the
 values supported and reinforced within an organization influence the types of HR systems that are in
 place within that organization and then these systems, in turn, affect the organization's climate. This
 resulting climate then has been shown to positively impact employee attitudes and behavior, as well as
 individual and organizational performance (Ferris, Arthur, Berkson, Kaplan, Harrell-Cook, & Frink,
 1998).

 Drawing from this previous theory-building and research, supportive organizational climate as
 examined in this study can be defined as the overall amount of perceived support employees receive
 from their immediate peers, other departments, and their supervisor that they view as helping them to
 successfully perform their work duties. We also propose that this perceived supportive climate relates
 to desired outcomes.

 A conceptual linkage between supportive organizational climate and performance can be drawn

 from research by Renn and Vandenberg (1995). Their study examined Hackman and Oldham's (1980)
 widely recognized job characteristics model. Specifically, they examined the mediating role that the
 critical psychological states (CPS experiencedmeaningfulness, experienced responsibility for
 outcomes of the work, and knowledge of the results of one's work) has between the core job dimensions
 (i.e., skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback) and individual performance
 (Renn & Vandenberg, 1995). Their findings generally supported the mediating role of CPS and
 may provide some support for our proposed mediating role that PsyCap plays between positive,
 supportive climate and individual employee performance. More specifically, in order for a variable
 that is more outside of the individual to affect individual performance (like the core job dimensions in
 the Renn and Vandenberg, 1995 study, or the unit's supportive organizational climate in the current
 study), there may be an important role for a mediating variable that is specific to the individual (like
 the critical psychological states in the Renn and Vandenberg (1995) study or PsyCap in the current
 study).

 Conventional wisdom might conclude that the amount of support that individuals receive from their

 organization would directly lead to higher performance. Some research has indeed shown a direct
 relationship between these variables (e.g., Eisenberger et al., 1990). However, if someone does not have
 the aptitude or individual capacity to perform a task, all of the support possible would not necessarily
 yield a consistent level of success. Therefore, though the relationship between support and performance
 has some evidence, the results have not been consistent and the process needs further investigation for
 better understanding and prediction.

 Research by Gardner and colleagues (Gardner & Schermerhorn, 2004; Schermerhorn et al., 1990)

 also supports the importance of individual factors (e.g., ability and effort) in the link between
 organizational support and individual performance. Hopefully by examining these mediating links, we

 226 F. LUTHANS ET AL.

 can begin to explain prior research conducted in the area of supportive climate that has produced an
 inconsistent relationship with performance (Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Becker & Gerhart, 1996).
 Therefore, based on this previous research, the current study does not hypothesize a direct relationship
 between supportive climate and individual employee performance, but does propose that psychological
 capital may play a mediating role in this relationship.

 Although the relationship between organizational support and performance has not been consistently
 demonstrated in the past, prior research has shown a direct relationship between supportive climate and
 other desirable individual and organizational outcomes. For example, the research previously
 mentioned by Rogg and colleagues (Rogg et al., 2001) verified the importance of supportive
 organizational climate and measures of customer satisfaction. Eisenberger et al. (1990) found a
 relationship between perceived organizational support and measures of employee diligence,
 commitment, and innovation. Rhoades et al., (2001) reported a direct relationship between perceived
 organizational support and commitment to the organization. Therefore, past research supports the
 relationship between the amount of organizational support that one perceives and their commitment to
 that organization.

 We also propose that perceptions of a supportive climate may create the positive conditions
 necessary for PsyCap to flourish. For example, when employees feel supported, they are more likely
 to use the pathway generation characteristic of hope to try unproven or new methods to accomplish
 tasks within the organizational context. Likewise, given that resiliency is defined in terms of assets
 and resources, a supportive climate will likely act as a contextual resource for individuals to quickly
 "bounce back" after setbacks. For example, when a setback occurs due to an employee mistake,
 those in a supportive climate will likely experience higher levels of resiliency as they would not
 be in fear of reprisal or punishment due to their mistake. They can remain focused on the task at
 hand, putting the setback behind them and effectively responding in a positive way following a
 setback.

 Still another example of how a supportive climate may contribute to individual levels of PsyCap can

 be understood in terms of optimistic attributions. For example, when experiencing a supportive climate,
 mistakes are more likely attributed to external, unstable, and specific issues; i.e., encouraging
 employees to be optimistic in their attributions. For instance, if employees make mistakes in a
 supportive climate, they will continue to feel supported in terms of their abilities allowing them to
 attribute failures to external circumstances versus low personal knowledge, skills and abilities. Even if
 attributed to the individual, in a supportive climate one would expect the message to be, let's try this
 again a different way.

 Based on theory and research on both the newly emerging psychological capital core construct, and
 the more established supportive organizational climate reviewed above, we derive the following
 hypotheses:

 Hypothesis 1. Psychological capital is positively related with employee performance, satisfaction,
 and commitment.

 Hypothesis 2. Supportive climate is positively related with employee satisfaction and commitment.

 To test the role that psychological capital may play in the supportive climate employee

 performance relationship, the study's major hypothesis is the following:

 Hypothesis 3. Psychological capital mediates the relationship between supportive climate and
 employee performance.

 Organizational Context

 SUPPORTIVE CLIMATE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL 227

 Services firm
 The services firm sample in Study 2 has been in existence for approximately 30 years and provides
 technical and administrative services to insurance firms and individual customers. There are
 currently 1200 people employed in the division where this study took place. With the exception of a
 small group (<25) of computer programmers, all non-management employees are non-exempt and
 the company offers traditional benefits to all employees. The insurance service specialists that
 participated in this study work in an environmentally controlled office located in a medium-sized
 city in the middle of the U.S. The firm uses only one shift (i.e., 8:00A.M.-5:00P.M.) and all
 employees are located in the same building. Employees receive telephone calls and e-mails from
 both commercial (insurance firm) and individual clients. The majority of working hours is devoted
 to the use of a database to serve and process insurance claims or make changes to policies based on
 customer requests. Employees generally interface with their manager and coworkers throughout the
 day in between phone calls and on scheduled work breaks.

 High-technology manufacturing firm
 The high technology manufacturing firm sample in Study 3 has been in existence since 1916 when
 its founder bought a shipyard in the state of Washington in the U.S. The firm now employs over
 100 000 people and is one of the largest military contactors for the United States Department of
 Defense. The major divisions in the organization include commercial manufacturing, military
 manufacturing, space exploration, and satellite services. Employees who participated in this study
 are electrical design engineers and technicians for the commercial division. Specifically, the
 employees design wire bundle assemblies for the electrical subsystems of the products. They are
 generally highly compensated and work in an office building with frequent visits to the factory floor
 where they personally attend to design issues while products are being manufactured. In addition,
 the work day consists of team meetings and designing components at computerized design stations
 using engineering software. They are generally highly educated and commonly work autonomously
 and simultaneously on multiple projects.

 Methods

 Separate samples were used to test the hypothesized relationships. Study 1 utilized a sample (N = 404)
 that were all the students from designated management classes at two Midwestern universities. It
 should be noted this sample was also used for other purposes (i.e., not testing hypotheses as in the
 present study) in previous research (Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007). These participants had an average
 age of 21.10 years (SD = 2.66) and 58 per cent were male. Although the emerging adult population is
 an interesting population for the future of organizations (Arnett, 2000), for better generalization,
 Studies 2 and 3 used two separate field samples including organizations that represent both service and
 high-tech manufacturing industries (see Organizational Context for specifics on these two firms).

 The sample in Study 2 was made up of 163 out of about 200 employees in the policy and claims

 processing group (82 per cent), who volunteered to participate in the study. They represented all the

 various functions and levels of a midsize insurance services firm (i.e., they service insurance policies
 and claims from other firms). It should be noted that an iteration of this sample was used in previous
 research to lend support to the relationship between PsyCap and performance and satisfaction (Luthans,
 Avolio et al., 2007). Therefore, this sample was not used to test Hypothesis 1 in this study regarding
 the relationship between PsyCap and performance/satisfaction, but since this study's variable of
 supportive climate was not used in the previous research, this sample is used to test the second and third
 hypotheses. The demographics for employees in this sample had an average age of 33.79 years (SD =
 10.85), a mean of 2.07 (SD = 2.08) years of experience in the organization, and 57 per cent were female.
 The sample for Study 3 consisted of engineers and technicians from a very large (Fortune 100, over
 100 000 employees) high-tech manufacturing firm. It should again be noted that previous research
 (Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007) also used a sample from this same firm, but the sample from this firm used
 in the present study is a different group of participants collected several months later than the sample
 used in the previous research. Therefore, the sample in this study is used to test all three hypotheses.
 Out of the 288 who were recruited to participate, 170 volunteered (59%). They had an average age of
 44.74 years (SD = 8.76), mean organizational tenure of 15.9 (SD = 7.8), and 80 per cent were male.

 Supportive climate measure

 To measure the supportive climate we used the Rogg et al. (2001) questionnaire that has demonstrated
 considerable psychometric support. Using all 12 items from 2 out of the 4 factors, this shortened scale
 contained aspects of climate most relevant to this study (managerial consideration and employee
 cooperation/coordination factors). The reliabilities for this supportive climate scale utilized in the three
 samples were as follows: Study 1, .93; Study 2, .93; Study 3, .89. Sample items included: "Managers
 consistently treat everyone with respect" and "Departments cooperate to get the job done effectively
 and efficiently" with response categories from 1= strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = somewhat
 disagree, 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = agree, and 6 = strongly agree.

 PsyCap measure

 The measure of PsyCap was the psychological capital questionnaire or PCQ (Luthans, Youssef et al.,
 2007). This PCQ draws from widely recognized published standardized measures for each of the
 positive constructs that make up PsyCap as follows: (1) hope (Snyder et al., 1996); (2) resiliency
 (Wagnild & Young, 1993); (3) optimism (Scheier & Carver, 1985); and (4) self-efficacy (Parker, 1998)
 and the PCQ has demonstrated reliability and construct validity (Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007).

 The 24-item PCQ (6 items for each subscale of hope, resilience, optimism, and efficacy) has
 responses put into a six-point Likert-type scale with categories ranging from 1 = strongly disagree,
 2 = disagree, 3 = somewhat disagree, 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = agree, 6 = strongly agree. To reflect the
 state-like quality of PsyCap, the questions were framed to ask the participants how they felt "right
 now." Further, questions were adapted to make the target context specific to the workplace. For
 example, 21 out of the 24 items contained the terms work, company, or job. The entire instrument can
 be found in Luthans, Youssef et al. (2007, pp. 237-238). Sample items include: "At the present time, I
 am energetically pursuing my work goals" (hope); "I can get through difficult times at work because
 I've experienced difficulty before" (resiliency); "I feel confident contacting people outside the
 company (e.g., suppliers, customers) to discuss problems" (self-efficacy); and "When things are
 uncertain for me at work I usually expect the best" (optimism). To get a composite PsyCap score, all six
 responses for each of the four subscales were summed and averaged to first get a subscale composite
 average for each of the four subscales. Then, the averages for each of the four subscales were added

 SUPPORTIVE CLIMATE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL 229

 together and averaged to get a composite average for each subject's PsyCap score. This PCQ measure
 of overall PsyCap had reliabilities for the present studies as follows: Study 1, .89; Study 2, .89; and
 Study 3, .91.

 Although this measure of PsyCap has been given previous research attention (see Luthans, Avolio
 et al., 2007), since it is still relatively new, to further examine the psychometric properties of the PCQ
 for this study, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). A CFA was deemed the appropriate
 technique versus an exploratory factor analysis as CFAs are used when there is theoretical rationale for
 an a priori factor structure. Given that each subscale has been derived from recognized theories and
 measures on hope, resilience, optimism, and efficacy in positive psychology, the PCQ clearly had a
 rationale for a four factor structure, and, as discussed in the theoretical foundation above, for a latent
 higher order PsyCap factor.

 Using maximum likelihood techniques, we found adequate indices for the four-factor structure with
 each dimension's six items loading significantly (p < .01) on their respective dimension (e.g.,
 resiliency). Specifically, the item loadings ranged from .89—.98 and were all statistically significant at
 p < .01. In addition, each dimension loaded very high on the latent factor PsyCap with hope, resilience,
 optimism, and efficacy all loading at .99. Specifically, the X2(246) = 1532.84, CFI (.97), RMSEA (.08),
 and SRMR (.01) were well within Hu and Bentler's (1999) combinatorial recommendations for
 adequate indices. In addition, we compared this second-order factor structure with a single latent factor
 (e.g., all 24 items loading on a single latent factor) using a X2 significance test and determined the four
 factor second-order structure to be the best fitting model (0x2 (7) = 1831.14, p < .001).

 Performance measures

 Although only the performance measure in Study 1 was self-reported, it was still gathered at a later time
 than when the predictor variables were gathered in order to minimize single (self) source effects/bias
 (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). This measure utilized in Study 1 requested
 participants to rate their overall performance as related to their peers ("How would you rate your
 performance/effectiveness as compared with your peers?" 1 = bottom 10%, 2 = 10-20%, . . . 10 = top
 10%). Since the sample utilized in Study 1 were emerging adults, this measure was framed in terms of
 asking them to compare their performance in a current (or most recent if not working now) job or in a
 real and relevant project or assignment that they are currently involved in, so they were answering in
 work-related contexts.

 Study 2 with service employees utilized actual performance evaluation data on the participants

 obtained from their organizations' human resources department. Participants' performance was
 determined by their managers completing the company evaluation process, which is done every quarter.
 The performance evaluation was provided to the researchers in a composite form. Throughout the
 quarter, managers had access to employees' number of claims processed and customer service ratings.
 At the end of each quarter, the managers were asked to give their employees a rating based on the
 following three factors: the amount of claims processed (quantity), customer service (quality), and the
 manager's rating of "overall performance." The performance composite used as a measure in Study 2
 was on a scale of 1-5. It was designed and used over the years for performance feedback, merit
 increases, and promotion decisions in this service firm.

 For the high-tech firm in Study 3, participants' managers derived a composite performance index

 based on rating their performance in terms of the following four factors: quality, quantity, teamwork,
 and contributing to the organization's mission. Each factor was rated on a scale of 1-10 and was
 provided by the human resources department to the researchers as an overall composite that served as
 the performance measure for this study. Similar to the performance metrics in the service firm in Study

 2, this performance evaluation at the high-tech manufacturing firm has been used over the years for
 performance feedback, merit increases, and promotion decisions. This was the existing performance
 evaluation process and was conducted bi-annually. Studies 2 and 3 allowed the methodological
 advantages of time separations between survey data collection and the independent, unobtrusive ratings
 of performance.

 Satisfaction and commitment measures

 In addition to performance, these studies also examined the relationship between supportive climate
 and the work attitudes of satisfaction and commitment. As is commonly used in other organizational
 behavior research (e.g., Judge & Bono, 2001), all three studies used a three item satisfaction scale
 adapted from Hackman and Oldham (1980) using the same 1-6 rating as was utilized for the
 psychological capital measure. Participants rated their satisfaction using a six-point Likert-type scale
 with categories ranging from 1= strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = somewhat disagree,
 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = agree, 6 = strongly agree. A sample item is "I am generally satisfied with
 the kind of work I do in this job." As with the self-reported performance measure utilized in Study 1,
 the job satisfaction data were gathered at a later point in time from the predictor climate and PsyCap
 measures in order to minimize bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Reliabilities for this satisfaction measure
 were as follows: Study 1, .87; Study 2, .86; Study 3, .83.

 The organizational commitment measure used the most relevant affective scale from the Allen and
 Meyer (1990) instrument. Again, responses were put into a six-point Likert scale ranging from 1=
 strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = somewhat disagree, 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = agree, 6 = strongly
 agree. A sample item is "I feel emotionally connected to the company for which I work." Once again
 the organizational commitment data were gathered at a later point in time from the predictor scales in
 order to minimize rating bias. Reliabilities for this commitment measure were as follows: Study 1, .83;
 Study 2, .91; Study 3, .79.

 Procedures

 In Study 1, management students consented to participate in an "Organizational Behavior and
 Leadership" project and were provided a web address in order to register. They were then
 electronically sent a unique password via e-mail that enabled them to log onto the site and take the
 questionnaire survey at two points in time. As Podsakoff and colleagues (2003, p. 887) have suggested,
 this "makes it impossible for the mindset of the source or rater to bias the observed relationship
 between the predictor and criterion variables, thus eliminating the effects of consistency motifs,
 implicit theories, and social desirability tendencies." The first session of the survey contained the
 predictor study variables of climate and PsyCap and, after taking this initial survey, participants waited
 about a week before they were able to go back to the site, log in, and complete session two of the survey
 which included the satisfaction, commitment, and performance study variables. It should be noted that
 the survey questions were not altered for the student sample in order to keep the data collection as
 consistent as possible across samples. However, as indicated in the discussion of the Study 1
 performance measure above, the instruction to the student participants was to frame the questions in
 terms of their current (or most recent) job or in a relevant class project or assignment so that they were
 answering in a work-related context.

 The on-line method was also used in Study 2 to gather survey data on the predictor variables from
 employees in the insurance service firm. Again following Podsakoff and colleagues' (2003)
 recommendations, the actual performance measure of the participants in this sample was gathered from

 records in the human resources department of that organization at a different point in time. In addition
 to this temporal strategy of data collection, we also cross-checked against company records to confirm
 the accuracy of the self-reported demographic data and found no inconsistencies.

 For the high tech manufacturing firm in Study 3, members of the electrical design engineering group

 were sent an invitation to participate in an "Organizational Behavior and Leadership" project.
 Participation was encouraged but was voluntary. Those who chose to participate were sent an e-mail
 with a URL on a secure server to complete the first survey session which included the climate and
 PsyCap questionnaires. After one week they were sent a second URL to complete the final survey
 which included the satisfaction and commitment questions. Again, like Sample 2, the actual
 performance measure for these Study 3 participants was gathered from the organization's human
 resources department records representing another point in time.

 Analyses

 To test the study hypotheses, various analyses as reported in Tables 1 and 2 were utilized. The primary
 analysis technique used for testing the main hypothesis on PsyCap mediation of the
 climate-performance relationship was Baron and Kenny's (1986) technique, as revised by Kenny,
 Kashy, and Bolger (1998). This approach requires estimating three regression equations. In the first
 equation, the dependent variable (performance) was regressed on the independent variable (supportive
 climate). In the second equation, the mediating variable (PsyCap) was regressed on the independent
 variable (supportive climate). In the third equation, the dependent variable (performance) was
 regressed on both the independent variable (supportive climate) and the mediating variable (PsyCap).

 According to Baron and Kenny (1986), there is support for mediation if the following are obtained:
 (1) the first regression equation shows that the independent variable relates to the dependent variable;
 (2) the second equation shows that the independent variable relates to the mediating variable; and (3)
 the third regression shows that the mediating variable relates to the dependent variable and

 relationship of the independent variable with the dependent variable is significantly lower in magnitude
 in the third equation than in the second. For full mediation, the independent variable must not relate to
 the dependent variable when the mediating variable is added to the equation. However, as revised by
 Kenny et al. (1998), condition one is no longer required for mediation as long as the other two
 conditions are met. That is, in testing the PsyCap mediation hypothesis, according to Kenny et al.
 (1998) it is not required for supportive climate to be significantly related to the dependent variable
 (performance) in their bi-variate relationship. They note as long as steps two and three are met, the path
 to the dependent variable is implied, and therefore, condition one is no longer required to statistically
 demonstrate mediation.

 Sobel (1982) tests were also conducted to further support the mediation model as proposed. This test

 is designed to assess whether a mediating variable (PsyCap) carries the effects of the independent
 variable (supportive climate) to a dependent variable (performance). The computed statistic measures
 the indirect effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable by way of the mediator.
 Reported p-values are obtained from the unit normal distribution under the assumption of a two-tailed
 test of the hypothesis that the mediated effect equals zero in the population using ±1.96 as the critical
 values which contain the central 95 per cent of the unit normal distribution (Preacher & Hayes, 2004).
 Under this test, a significant p-value indicates support for mediation. Finally, the classic Aroian (1944/
 1947) test of mediation was used to further verify the results.

 Results

 The means, standard deviations, and correlations among all variables for all three studies are shown in
 Table 1. As shown, there is full support for Hypothesis 1 that PsyCap is significantly related to
 performance, satisfaction, and commitment in both Study 1 (r = .25, p < .01 for performance; r = .39,
 p < .01 for satisfaction; and r = .31, p < .01 for commitment) and Study 3 (r = .25, p < .01 for
 performance; r = .72, p < .01 for satisfaction; and r = .48, p < .01 for commitment). As indicated in
 Table 1, these relationships are also significant in Study 2, but, as indicated earlier, since a version of

 SUPPORTIVE CLIMATE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL 233

 this service employee sample and variables were used in previous research, these Study 2 results were
 excluded in testing Hypothesis 1 in the present study.

 Table 1 also shows support for Hypothesis 2, that supportive climate is significantly related to

 satisfaction and commitment. These relationships held across all three studies (in Study 1 for
 satisfaction r = .58, p < .01 and for commitment r = .62, p < .01; in Study 2 for satisfaction r = .49,
 p < .01 and for commitment r = .60, p < .01; and in Study 3 for satisfaction r = .54, p < .01 and for
 commitment r = .55, p < .01).

 Although the positive results for the relationship of both PsyCap with performance, satisfaction, and
 commitment and supportive climate with satisfaction and commitment replicate much of the previous
 research, most important to this study is the full support found for this study's major Hypothesis 3.
 PsyCap mediated the relationship between supportive climate and employee performance. Regression
 results for each sample are shown in Table 2.

 Regression coefficients for supportive climate were non-significant for each sample when perfor-

 mance was regressed on supportive climate ( ,8 = .04, p = .42 for Sample 1; = .07, p = .46 for Sample 2;
 and /3 = .02, p = .79 for Sample 3). However, regression coefficients for supportive climate were
 significant for all three samples when PsyCap was regressed on supportive climate ($ = .23, p < .01 for
 Sample 1; f3 = .50, p < .01 for Sample 2; and /3 = .52, p < .01 for Sample 3). Lastly, when performance
 was regressed on both PsyCap and supportive climate, PsyCap was the only variable that contributed
 significantly to the equation (for PsyCap, /3 = .25, p < .01 for Sample 1; $ ---- .26, p < .05 for Sample 2;
 and /3 = .32, p < .01 for Sample 3). Furthermore, the already weak relationship between supportive
 climate and performance weakened further to become slightly negative 03 = —.02, p = .72 for Sample
 1; /3 = —.05, p = .63 for Sample 2; and ,6 = —.12, p = .24 for Sample 3), indicating full mediation.
 In sum, conditions two and three of Baron and Kenny's (1986) tests for mediation were satisfied
 while condition one was not. Nevertheless, based on the revised criteria (Kenny et al., 1998),
 Hypothesis 3 is supported that PsyCap fully mediates the relationship between supportive climate and
 employee performance.

 In addition, Sobel (1982) tests were conducted for each sample as a means of further examining

 evidence for mediation above and beyond procedures recommended by Kenny and colleagues (Baron
 & Kenny, 1986; Kenny et al., 1998). Results of three separate Sobel tests supported PsyCap mediating
 the relationship between supportive climate and performance. The Sobel test was significant in all three
 samples; in Sample 1, z = 3.24, p < .01; in Sample 2, z = 2.23, p < .05; and in Sample 3, z = 2.83,
 p < .01.

 Results of the Sobel tests also parallel those using the Aroian tests which were found to be significant

 in all three samples: in Sample 1, z = 3.21, p < .01; in Sample 2, z = 2.20, p < .05; and in Sample 3,
 z = 2.81, p < .01. The Aroian tests do not make the assumption that the products of the standard errors
 of both regression coefficients used in the calculation is "vanishingly" small (Aroian, 1944/1947; also
 see Baron & Kenny, 1986; Preacher & Hayes, 2004). This Aroian test is being used by researchers as an
 additional way for testing mediation. Thus, all of the statistical tests supported PsyCap as mediating the
 relationship between supportive climate and performance and thus provides full support for the study's
 major hypothesis.

 Discussion

 As found in previous research, across two heterogeneous samples in the present study, psychological
 capital was found to be positively related to performance, satisfaction, and commitment. Also
 supporting previous research, across three heterogeneous samples in the present study, supportive

 climate was found to be positively associated with both satisfaction and commitment. Given the value
 placed on replication and convergence and the heterogeneity among study samples, these results
 suggest strong external validity for a positive relationship of individual employees' reported PsyCap
 and their performance, satisfaction, and commitment, as well as their perceptions of a supportive
 climate and their commitment and satisfaction.

 Beyond providing additional support for earlier findings, this study's major finding and contribution

 involved the role positive psychological capital may play as an important mediating link between
 supportive organizational climate and employee performance. Specifically, this study provides initial
 evidence that in concert with a supportive climate, positivity in general and psychological capital in
 particular, may have a desired impact on employees' actual performance.

 Although recent research has indicated that psychological capital is positively related to

 performance (Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007; Luthans et al., 2005), satisfaction (Larson & Luthans, 2006;
 Luthans, Avolio et al., 2007), and negatively with absenteeism (Avey, Patera, & West, 2006), this is the
 first study to examine the role that psychological capital may play in the supportive
 climate—performance relationship. Also, arguably more influential to the direction of future research,
 this study contributes to the theoretical understanding and empirical support from three diverse samples
 as to the conditions in which PsyCap may manifest itself. Specifically, employees who perceive the
 climate in their organizations to be more supportive may be more likely to experience higher levels of
 PsyCap which in turn positively impacts their performance in both service and high-tech
 manufacturing. Given the seeming importance of PsyCap in predicting employee outcomes, these
 studies demonstrate the utility of a supportive climate and the importance of the relationship between
 these perceptions and employees' PsyCap and performance. However, before conclusions can be
 drawn, the limitations of this study must be recognized.

 One limitation is found in Study 1 that depends on management student survey data including
 self-reported performance. To help minimize this potential problem, the predictor variables were
 separated in time from the dependent variables. Moreover, Study 1 can be considered as a pilot because
 we followed up with two studies that utilized employee samples from both service and high-tech
 manufacturing firms, both of which had organizational performance measures gathered independent of
 the study. Importantly for reliability and generalizability, results were identical across all three of these
 diverse samples.

 Another potential limitation that needs to be recognized concerns the nature of cross-sectional
 research. While replication and diverse samples are strengths of the current study, causal inferences that
 supportive climate and PsyCap causes employee performance cannot be made. We depended on
 existing theory and prior research to describe the phenomena and did find that the predicted
 relationships exist. However, the direction of the relationship can not be determined without
 establishing temporal precedence and experimental manipulations. In other words, the direction of
 causality has not been established with this study and the possibility of alternative hypotheses (e.g.,
 high performance leads to PsyCap and a supportive climate) cannot be ruled out.

 In addition, common method variance within (as well as between) independent or dependent

 variables may lead to artificially high correlations. For example, Studies 2 and 3 showed a strong
 correlation between PsyCap and supportive climate. While these constructs have clear discriminant
 validity and this correlation leads us to conclude they only potentially share about 25 per cent of
 common variance, there still may be common method bias that could have impacted the pattern of
 results observed in these three studies. Similar limitations may exist with the high correlations between
 satisfaction and commitment. However, once again, it is important to note that the major contribution of
 this study, i.e., the mediation role of PsyCap between supportive climate and performance, did include
 temporal separation between the predictor and criterion variables which can potentially help reduce the
 common method bias limitation of such relationships.

 Implications and Conclusion

 SUPPORTIVE CLIMATE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL 235

 Several practical implications emerge from the results of the study. First, this study provides further
 evidence of the important role that PsyCap may play in positively impacting the performance and work
 attitudes of employees and potentially may contribute to an organization's competitive advantage. In
 other words, although important, it is not enough just to provide a positive or supportive organizational
 climate to get optimal impact on performance. This study would suggest that it may be important to
 recognize that the level of an employees' psychological capital may also play a role in leveraging what
 a positive or supportive organizational climate can contribute to performance. An implication for both
 better theoretical understanding and effective practice concerning the supportive climate—performance
 impact relationship is the role of PsyCap as an important psychological resource for today's
 organizations.

 In conclusion, the results of this study not only suggest the seeming value of employees' psycho-

 logical capital at all levels within organizations, but also the benefits that may result from organizations
 providing positive, supportive climates. Since psychological capital is "state-like" and there is at least
 preliminary evidence that it can be developed (e.g., Luthans et al., 2006, in press), investing in and
 developing employees' psychological capital may be an example of the new thinking and new approaches
 that are needed for the "flat world" environment facing today's organizations and their leaders.
