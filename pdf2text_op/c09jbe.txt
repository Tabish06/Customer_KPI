Ethical Values and Environmentalism
in China: Comparing Employees
from State-Owned and Private Firms

Ó Springer 2009

Rosa Chun

ABSTRACT. Industrial pollution is of both national and
international concern in the context where one country’s
emissions contribute to the problem of global warming.
Existing studies have focused on government and regu-
lations rather than on employees. The context of this
study is in respect of 472 workers in seven Chinese energy
companies in Shanxi province in China, one of the big-
gest coal mining regions and a region most responsible for
environmental pollution. The key findings are two-fold:
first, employees’ values were positively correlated with
attitudes toward the environment, which also correlates
with perceived corporate citizenship; second, the own-
ership type of the firm had a significant influence on
corporate citizenship, employee values and their attitudes
toward environment. Contrary to existing beliefs, State-
owned enterprises in China have much poorer ratings on
all the three constructs compared to privately owned
companies. The results highlight the role of the govern-
ment and policy makers in shaping employees’ attitudes
toward the environment, and in turn the corporate citi-
zenship of the Chinese energy industry.

Environmentalism in China

No other issue threatens to change our world more
than global warming. Companies whose growth have
depended on cheap energy now face two challenges:
a rise in energy prices and the allegation that certain
types of energy consumption are socially irresponsi-
ble. Some companies and indeed some countries
stand accused of valuing economic growth above the
future of the planet. The main focus of this article is

the energy sector in China where conﬂicts between
these two values is most apparent.

air

and water quality,

Since joining the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in 2001, China has become the second
largest economy and energy consumer in the world,
after
the U.S. The fast economic growth has,
however, earned China a reputation for being the
most polluted country, the largest SO2 and second
largest CO2 emitter in the world (C.I.A., 2006;
U.N., 2006). In particular, coal and raw chemical
productions in China represent the world’s largest
sources of urban air pollution, damaging human
health,
and agriculture
(Collier, 1995). China’s coal mining industry is also
referred to as being the most dangerous in the world,
as mine owners and local government ofﬁcials tend
to ignore safety standards in search of quick proﬁts.1
Existing studies on environmentalism in China
have mainly focused on government regulation on
environmental issues, or surveyed university students
in major Chinese cities on environmental attitudes
(e.g., Benton, 1994), rather than focusing on internal
factors such as the values and attitudes held by the
employees
from the companies where environ-
mental pollution is a major concern. While there are
studies focusing on environmental leaders’ personal
and environmental values
through case studies
(Flannery and May, 1994; Lerner, 1998) or inter-
views with leaders from Western ﬁrms (Egri and
Herman, 2000), empirical studies examining envi-
ronmental values of employees in the context of
Chinese ﬁrms are scarce.

This research aims to identify employees’ values
and other organizational
factors which inﬂuence
environmentalism and corporate citizenship in the
Chinese coal-mining sector. A questionnaire survey

of 472 employees who work for energy companies
in Shanxi Province investigates whether or not,
individual variables such as employees’ values and
attitudes
toward the environment and corporate
variables
such as corporate ownership, predict
corporate citizenship.

Employee values and environmental
attitude

Businesses engage with environmental activities lar-
gely because they are afraid of legal consequences, or
they believe it is the right thing to do. Empirical
studies of environmentalism in China have focused
on the lack of environmental regulations and gov-
ernment commitment (e.g., Ho, 2001). However,
the effectiveness of environmental regulation on
inﬂuencing the environmental attitude (Fryxell and
Szeto, 2002) or performance is largely unproven
(Schaper, 2002). More recently, socio-psychological
factors such as public protests and riots (Chan et al.,
2008), Green image (Chen, 2008), or environmental
awareness began to receive attention as emerging
factors that lead to environmental attitudes.

Values deﬁne priorities that are crucial for the
resolution of ethical dilemmas (Hosmer, 1987). A
survey by Beijing University quoted by Wong (2005)
reveals that China’s particularly low level of envi-
ronmental awareness could be attributed to personal
values. Among the survey respondents, 65% believed
humans should ‘‘conquer’’ or ‘‘utilize’’ nature for
their own beneﬁt, which is much emphasized in
Mao’s ideology. The survey also found that Chinese
citizens hold a strong ‘‘government-reliance attitude
towards environmental protection’’ (Wong, 2005).
Garbrenya and Hwang (1996) describe the Chinese
as ‘‘strikingly dispassionate and ‘rationalistic,’ resting
heavily on objective, situational factors rather than on
considerations of other people’s feelings.’’ Such val-
ues seem to be receptive to new industries, which
bring wealth to the area at the expense of the envi-
ronment and the lives of workers. The above
characteristics
tend to correspond
with Schwartz’s (1994, 1999) Self-enhancement and
Conservatism values.

and values

Conservatism (security, tradition, conformity) deﬁned
by Schwartz is a cultural emphasis on maintenance of
the status quo, or the traditional order. The opposite

emphasis on the desirability of individuals indepen-

as a cultural emphasis on hierarchy, authority,
wealth, and achievement. The opposite pole of self
enhancement is Self-transcendence (universalism, benev-
olence).
the value of
‘‘universalism’’
(environmental protection, unity
with nature), then this may drive him to behave
more responsibly toward environment protection. If
a personal value inﬂuences personal behavior, then a
positive link between employees’ values and cor-
porate citizenship behavior is expected (Heming-
way, 2005). When an employer’s citizenship is
perceived to be high by its own employees, they are
more likely to commit to their employer. In other
words, employee commitment

corporate citizenship (Maignan et al., 1999). Thus,

1998 saw a government document highlighting
reforms in the governance system of SOEs in the
coal industry which led to the abolishment of the
Department of Coal Industry and deregulation of
the coal industry to introduce private capital, in-
crease output, and to remove the ﬁnancial burden of
SOEs. By 2003, privately owned coalmines ac-
counted for 35% of China’s total coal output, large
coal mines administered under the central govern-
ment accounted for 45%, and small mines run under
local government accounted for 17%0.2 Most private
coal mines are smaller, many of them illegal. While
the decentralization of
the coal-mining sector
boosted local economies, generated employment,
and supplemented tax revenues, it also led to various
problems such as increasing death tolls, appalling
health safeguards, dangerous pollution levels, and
poor resource utilization.

While there is little empirical evidence, existing
studies (e.g., Farh et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2006)
have argued that non-SOEs tend to be less com-
mitted than SOEs
to ethical and environmental
citizenship. For example, SOE employees in China
report more
social welfare participation than
employees from non-SOEs who tend to see saving
company resources as a primary citizenship behav-
iour (Farh et al., 2004). The positive effect of pro-
cedural justice on trust in organizations is stronger in
SOEs (Wong et al., 2006). The assumption for
SOEs is that proﬁt was not as important as other
technical
the production process,
including safety. Therefore, employees working for
the state probably participate more in social welfare
activities because their companies are more depen-
dent on the state, and are less concerned about
taking initiatives and saving company resources, and
because they are partially shielded from the full force
of market competition (Farh et al., 2004). Hence,
the hypotheses 4 and 5 are proposed as follows:

indicators of

Hypothesis 4: State-owned companies will perform
better than privately owned companies on cor-
porate citizenship (legal, ethical, and discretion-
ary) except for economic citizenship.

Hypothesis 5: State-owned companies’ employees
stronger Conservatism and Self-
will have
transcendence values and higher environmen-
tal attitudes than those from privately owned
companies.

Methodology

Sample

Existing studies on environmental issues in China
focus on large cities such as Beijing or Shanghai. The
empirical setting for this study is Shanxi province,
situated along the Yellow River in the northern part
of mainland China. The province produces one-third
of the coal in the whole of China,3 and supplies half
of the coke to the world market.4 Inevitably, Shanxi’s
pollution record is 4.6 times higher than the average
in China, and the accident rate is high. A total of 472
questionnaires were collected from employees from
seven energy companies (coal mining and washing,
electricity, and aluminum) in Shanxi province. A
total of 500 questionnaires were distributed to ran-
domly chosen employees and collected by hand: the
sample size in each ﬁrm varied from 50 to 200
according to the size of the company. The response
rate was over 90% in each ﬁrm due to the face-to face
administered survey method.

Measures

Employee value

The research used 10 values from the Schwartz
Value Survey (SVS; Schwartz, 1992). Four-second-
order factors were used for hypotheses testing on a
5-point Likert scale, ranging from not at all impor-
tant (1) to very important (5). They are Conserva-
tism (security, tradition, conformity), Self-transcendence
(universalism, benevolence), Self-enhancement (power,
achievement), and Openness to Change (self-direction,
hedonism, stimulation).

Environmental attitudes

Ten-item measures of environment action (Fryxell
and Lo, 2003) and three additional items drawn from
the World Value Survey were used. These reduced
to two orthogonal factors: Environmental awareness
(e.g., I stay up to date about environmental law and
regulations related to this business.), and Environ-
mental Commitment (e.g., I would give part of my

income if I were certain that the money would be
used to prevent environmental pollution).

Findings

Corporate citizenship

laws’’); economic

Corporate citizenship measures were taken from
Maignan et al. (1999). They are legal
citizenship
(5 items including ‘‘our company complies with
relevant environmental
citizenship
including ‘‘we have been successful at
(6 items
making our proﬁts’’); ethical
citizenship (6 items
including ‘‘our business has a comprehensive code of
conduct’’);
and discretionary citizenship (6 items
including ‘‘our business gives adequate contribution
to charities’’). The scale was used by other scholars
in measuring corporate citizenship perceived by
employees (e.g., Peterson, 2004).

Employee commitment

The Employee Commitment measure was taken
from Maignan et al. (1999); for example, ‘‘I feel my
future is intimately linked to this organization, I am
proud to work for this organization’’. A 5-point
Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree (1) to
strongly agree (5), was used to test the variables:
Environmental attitude, Corporate citizenship, and
Employee commitment.

Employee values, environmental attitudes, and corporate
citizenship

Table I shows the correlations between employee
values, environmental attitudes, corporate citizen-
ship, and employee commitment.

As expected from hypothesis 1, Conservatism
(security, tradition, conformity) and Self-transcendence
(universalism, benevolence) were the most highly and
positively correlated with the two Environmental
Attitude factors: environmental awareness (e.g., I stay
up to date about environmental law and regulations
related to this business) was signiﬁcantly correlated
with conservatism (r = 0.43) and self transcendence
(r = 0.47); environmental commitment (e.g., I would
give part of my income if I were certain that the
money would be used to prevent environmental
pollution) was signiﬁcantly correlated with conser-
vatism (r = 0.23) and self transcendence (r = 0.26).
Openness to change (self-direction, hedonism, stimula-
tion) is the next inﬂuential factor in shaping Chinese
employees’ attitudes
toward environment. How-
ever, Self-enhancement (power, achievement) had no
impact on environmental commitment (r = 0.07)
and the lowest impact on environmental aware-
ness (r = 0.16). Both environmental awareness and
commitment were strongly correlated with four
corporate citizenship factors (economic, legal, ethi-
cal, and discretionary). In other words, the more

positive the employees’ attitudes toward the envi-
ronment, the better their companies’ citizenship.
The hypothesis 2 is, thus, supported.

Finally, all the four corporate citizenship measures
were found to be signiﬁcantly correlated with
employee commitment, supporting the hypothesis 3.
In particular, regression analysis found that discre-
tionary citizenship was the major driver, explaining
61% of variances, of employee commitment. Some
correlations between values and corporate citizen-
ship were observed, too. Conservatism was posi-
tively correlated with three citizenships – economic,
legal, and ethical, but had no signiﬁcant correlation
with discretionary citizenship. In fact, none of the
four values had a signiﬁcant impact on discretionary
citizenship but employees’ attitudes
toward the
environment did. Self-enhancement and openness-
to-change values in the Chinese context have a
negative impact on discretionary citizenship. Open-
ness to change had no positive correlation with
ethical citizenship but a negative correlation with
discretionary citizenship. This is somewhat different

from what was expected. Self-enhancement is neg-
atively correlated with discretionary citizenship as
expected, but the correlation was insigniﬁcant. Self-
transcendence (universalism, benevolence) has a positive
correlation with discretionary citizenship, but again
the results were insigniﬁcant. In summary, discre-
tionary citizenship, the most important driver for
employee commitment, is inﬂuenced by employee
attitude toward environment.

Ownership type

The hypotheses 4 and 5 tested whether or not the
ownership of the ﬁrms has an impact on corporate
citizenship, employee values, and their environ-
mental attitudes. T test results (Table II) show that
ownership of the companies, whether state-owned
or privately owned, has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on all
the three variables: corporate citizenship, employees
values, and their attitudes toward the environment.
However, the hypotheses that SOEs will have higher

ethical, legal, and citizenship but lower economic
citizenship, compared to POEs, were not supported.
Contrary to the existing literature and assumption
(e.g., Farh et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2006), SOEs in
the Chinese coal mining and using sector had sig-
niﬁcantly lower levels of corporate citizenship on all
the four categories (economic,
legal, ethical, and
discretionary), compared to those of POEs (p <
0.001). The same trend was observed among
employees on their environmental attitudes. Con-
trary to the assumption, employees working for
SOEs had poorer attitudes toward the environment.
On employee values, employees working for SOEs
had signiﬁcantly lower scores on all the four values:
Conservatism, Self-enhancement, Self-transcendence,
and Openness to Change. The differences were the
smallest on Openness to Change.

Conclusions and implications

What makes employees proud of their company and
committed to their organization turned out to be
discretionary citizenship, which is, in turn, inﬂuenced
by employees’ attitudes toward the environment. The
ﬁndings have a number of HR implications. The
positive correlations between employee values and
environmental attitudes, and environmental attitudes
and corporate citizenship indicate that corporate cit-
izenship in China can start from shaping the personal
values and attitudes of employees who are more
receptive to environmental causes. In particular,
employees who put their priority in Conservatism
(security, tradition, conformity) and Self-transcendence
values (universalism, benevolence) tend to commit more
to the environmental cause. It would be ideal
if
employees especially with managerial role appreciate
high benevolence and conformity values in under-
standing the importance of environmental cause
naturally.

On the other hand,

the relationship between
employee values and discretionary citizenship was
indirect (via environmental attitude). The ﬁrst key
message from this research is
training and
engaging employees with various environmental and
voluntary programs seems to be a good starting point
for Chinese energy companies wishing to enhance
the commitment of
their employees, who often
work in a poor environment with relatively poor

that

rewards.

ﬁnancial
Improving employee attitudes
toward the environment will also enhance corporate
citizenship.

The signiﬁcantly lower corporate citizenship and
environmentalism in SOEs mean that the govern-
ment is failing in its role to promote positive atti-
tudes. The separation of ownership and management
in SOEs had been imposed in an increasing effort to
strengthen safety in the coal mining industry. For
example, the Chinese government ordered govern-
ment ofﬁcials and heads of SOEs
their
investment in coal mines by 2005 to minimize local
ofﬁcials’ ﬁnancial interests in the mines, but still 315
ofﬁcials and heads of SOEs were disciplined in 2006
in coal mines.5 This partly
for owning shares
explains the poor environmental attitudes in SOEs in
China. Nevertheless, current environmentalism in
China is still heavily reliant on governmental con-
trol, and Chinese employees have tended to rely
upon government to take the lead on environmental
practice (Chan et al., 1995; Emmott, 2008; Van
Rooij, 2006).

Increasing environmental

level
could mean more cost to the Chinese energy ﬁrms
who are going through a tough time. Therefore, the
research ﬁndings suggest that any change in energy
policy nationally will be hard to implement without
changing the internal culture of organizations and, in
particular, personal values and attitudes toward the
environment. In order to promote the organizational
culture or personal values that are more favorable to
environmental protection and responsible behavior,
providing appropriate training or voluntary pro-
grams would be as useful as reinforcing new legis-
lation. If China is to embrace alternatives to coal or
clean technology, individual employees may need to
become more involved.
