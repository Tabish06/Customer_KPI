The Interaction of Top Management Group,
Stakeholder, and Situational Factors on Certain
Corporate Reputation Management Activities*

abstract This study examines when a ﬁrm’s members are most likely to promote and
defend its reputation. Building on past research in impression management theory and
the upper-echelons perspective, I argue that ﬁrms facing increased visibility among
different stakeholder groups will increase corporate reputation management activities
towards those groups and decrease activities towards other groups. I further argue that
top management group characteristics will moderate these relationships, suggesting that
certain top management groups are more attuned to the situational needs of reputation
management. A set of hypotheses are tested using pooled cross-sectional time-series
data on a set of Fortune 500 companies. Results indicate that ﬁrms generally directed
reputation management activities towards their more visible stakeholders. However, the
type and extent of reputation management behaviour varied. Speciﬁcally, for ﬁrms
whose top management groups were more highly educated or output oriented, highly
visible situations with the media were more likely to be associated with a higher use
of press releases. Moreover, those same ﬁrms devoted more resources to mass media
advertising under situations of high consumer visibility compared to ﬁrms whose top
management groups were less educated or throughput oriented.

INTRODUCTION

Both scholars and the popular press have become increasingly interested in the
management of corporate reputation. A corporate reputation consists of a set of
key characteristics attributed to the ﬁrm by various stakeholders (Bromley, 1993,
2003), including, but not limited to, such attributes as quality of management,
quality of products or services, community and environmental responsibility, inno-
vativeness, and ﬁnancial soundness (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Having a
favourable reputation has been argued to be one of the best ways to attract and
retain good employees (Gatewood et al., 1993), charge premium prices (Milgrom

and Roberts, 1992), attract investors (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990), and build a
competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Roberts and Dowling, 2002).

Because of the numerous advantages of having a favourable reputation, many
executives have become increasingly concerned about the impact that organiza-
tional actions and communication can have on corporate reputation (Hall, 1992).
Even so, we know that all ﬁrms do not equally attend to their reputations. Some
companies are repeatedly lauded for their ability to handle situations that could
have been detrimental to their reputation. Other companies seem to be continually
criticized for their inability to address the concerns of their stakeholders. Why
might we see some ﬁrms engaged in more extensive reputation management
activities than others? While certain factors, such as the industry type or ﬁrm size
(Meznar and Nigh, 1995; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Swerdlow and Blessios,
1993), are widely accepted as promoting certain organizational behaviour, there
still remain critical differences among ﬁrms’ reputation management behaviour
that are left unexplained. The key to understanding these differences may lie in our
knowledge of how individuals manage their own reputations and how this trans-
lates to top management groups (TMG) (Hambrick, 1994) and organizational
behaviour.[1] The TMG directs actions such as press releases, press conferences,
and advertising, referred to here generally as reputation management activities
(RMA), in part to inﬂuence stakeholders’ perceptions of the ﬁrm’s reputation
(Ginzel et al., 1993; Russ, 1991). Because top management serves as the guardians
and promoters of a ﬁrm’s image (Gatewood et al., 1993), examining how the TMG
may impact reputation management efforts can be particularly important to
understanding why RMA differ across ﬁrms. Impression management theory
coupled with an upper-echelons perspective gives us such an opportunity.

Researchers in psychology and social psychology have spent several decades
exploring impression management and have helped us to understand how, when,
and what types of activities individuals may likely use to manage their own reputa-
tions (Goffman, 1959; Morrison and Bies, 1991). Environmental, situational, actor
and audience factors have each been argued to inﬂuence impression management
behaviour (Gardner and Martinko, 1988). In the past decade, several scholars have
successfully taken impression management theory to the organizational level (e.g.
Dutton and Dukerich, 1991; Elsbach, 1994; Elsbach and Sutton, 1992; Russ, 1991),
and have shown that using individual level research as a base from which to
understand organizational member actions may provide us with greater knowledge
of when RMA are most likely to be used at the organizational level. Bromley (2001)
similarly argues that the psychological study of personal reputation has implications
for the study of corporate reputation. As noted by Ginzel et al. (1993, p. 259),
‘. . . additional theory building and research is needed about the differences between
managing impressions of organizations and those of individuals’.

In conjunction with impression management theory, the upper-echelons per-
spective explores how the composition of the TMG is associated with organiza-

tional actions by considering the TMG’s decision making processes and subsequent
actions. Previous evidence suggests that the TMG is a key determinant of strategic
decisions and organizational outcomes (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1996; Ham-
brick and Mason, 1984). Upper-echelons research has investigated the association
between TMG characteristics and innovations (Bantel and Jackson, 1989), diver-
siﬁcation strategies and posture (Michel and Hambrick, 1992), strategic change
(Wiersema and Bantel, 1992) and other ﬁrm strategies and outcomes. However,
the strategic choice made by the TMG to engage in reputation management has
not been discussed through this perspective. Yet scholars have argued and practi-
tioners have agreed that this choice is an important one (Ginzel et al., 1993; Hall,
1992), and recent studies have addressed the relationship of TMG characteristics
to corporate social performance (Simerly, 2003; Thomas and Simerly, 1995).

While upper-echelons research has been criticized because of ambiguous results
(West and Schwenk, 1996), there has been a recent appeal arguing that ‘the
inconsistency of prior work points to the possibility that important moderating or
intervening variables have been overlooked, and that such omissions create oppor-
tunities for further research’ (Carpenter, 2002, p. 275). As such, scholars have
begun to explore how the interaction of situational factors and TMG characteris-
tics may affect certain organizational level behaviour such as corporate illegal
activity (Daboub et al., 1995) and ﬁrm performance (Carpenter, 2002). Under-
standing how the TMG interacts with other critical factors to inﬂuence organiza-
tional behaviour is a critical advancement to upper-echelons research.

From a practical standpoint, understanding what drives TMG behaviour and
organizational actions may help ﬁrms to establish clear guidelines regarding repu-
tation management and its expected impact on corporate reputation. Examining
the inﬂuence of multiple stakeholders on reputation management behaviour, this
study addresses an important, but previously neglected, element to this under-
standing (Ginzel et al., 1993).

I begin by developing a model which suggests that situational and audience
factors interact with actor characteristics to predict RMA at the organizational
level. I discuss why some TMGs may be attuned to the necessities, beneﬁts and/or
shortcomings of engaging in RMA on behalf of the ﬁrm more than others. Hypoth-
eses are developed, and the results of a set of empirical tests are presented. I
conclude with a discussion of implications and future research directions.

THEORY DEVELOPMENT

Impression management theory was originally developed in such diverse areas as
literature, philosophy and sociology. Most of the work in impression management
is based on the seminal work of Goffman (1959). Using the stage and actor as an
analogy, he described how people use interpersonal communication to create a
particular impression for others. As Schlenker (1980, p. 6) indicates, impression

management is ‘the conscious or unconscious attempt to control images that are
projected in real or imagined social interaction’. Chatman et al. refer to impression
management as a set of common behaviours that occur primarily because of ‘an
interpersonal motive to impress others or to satisfy external publics’ (1986, p. 196).
Generally, the motive to engage in impression management springs from the desire
to maximize expected rewards and minimize expected punishments (Schlenker,
1980).[2]

Impression management behaviour, guided by the TMG, is used to manage a
ﬁrm’s reputation as well. Several studies have shown that management makes key
decisions regarding actions used to promote or defend a ﬁrm’s reputation (Dutton
and Dukerich, 1991; Elsbach, 1994; Elsbach and Kramer, 1996; Elsbach and
Sutton, 1992; Russ, 1991). But what factors inﬂuence certain behaviour by orga-
nizational members? Both impression management theory and the upper-echelons
perspective provide possible answers.

The Actor, Audience, Situation and Behaviour Interface

Relying primarily on Goffman’s (1959) dramaturgical perspective, Gardner and
Martinko (1988) synthesized past theoretical and empirical work in psychology and
social psychology which detailed the interactive factors inﬂuencing impression
management behaviour. The environment provides a setting for the actor to
perform for an audience. Stimuli, based on actor and audience characteristics (e.g.
status, skills, personality traits), and situational cues (e.g. favourability and visibility),
are selectively perceived and interpreted, helping both the actor and audience to
deﬁne the situation. This situational deﬁnition is what provides the actors with a
guide to perform in such a way as to make the greatest impression on their audiences.
Thus, Gardner and Martinko (1988) conclude that the interaction of actor, audi-
ence, and situation can predict certain actor impression management behaviour.

I argue that a similar relationship exists at the organizational level. Figure 1
presents an overview of the model developed herein, summarizing the relationships
examined. In brief, as shown in Figure 1, the situational factor of organizational
visibility among certain audience (stakeholder) groups predicts certain RMA
directed towards those groups. This association is in turn moderated by actor
(TMG) characteristics. I now detail each of the elements of this model and set forth
formal hypotheses. I begin by discussing different types of RMA that a ﬁrm has at
its disposal, and then turn to those factors that predict the use of certain types of
activities.

Impression Management Behaviour (Corporate Reputation
Management Activities)

There are numerous impression management behaviours available to individuals.
Examples include self-presentations such as self-descriptions, opinion conformity,

accounts, apologies, self-enhancements and favours (Schlenker, 1980; Wood and
Mitchell, 1981). Organizational behaviour that parallels individual impression
management behaviour abounds. For example, organizational self-presentations
occur not only through verbal accounts, such as broadcast advertising or press
conferences, but also through written accounts, such as print media advertising,
press releases or proxy statements (Westphal and Zajac, 1998). Activities such as
press releases, advertising, press conferences,
letters to shareholders, annual
reports, and interviews with business publications are typically designed to manage
others’ perceptions of both certain aspects of a ﬁrm, such as its strategy implemen-
tation (Daft et al., 1993), as well as the general image of the ﬁrm (Bromley, 1993;
Fombrun, 1996; Ginzel et al., 1993; Schumann et al., 1991). I now detail two of
these activities that will later be empirically examined – press releases and mass
media advertising. These activities are indicated in Figure 1 by the right-hand
boxes. Both press releases and advertising may involve the use of various types of
impression management behaviour, including, but not limited to, self-descriptions,
accounts or self-enhancements (Mohamed et al., 1999).

Press releases. Press releases are used to externally communicate actions taken by the
ﬁrm or to respond to particular situations (Dern, 1995) and are a mechanism for
managing a ﬁrm’s reputation (Bromley, 2003). Press releases are submitted to
newswire services that then disseminate this information to the media by tele-
printer, directly to the newsroom of wire services, broadcasters, newspapers and

magazines. The releases can cover a broad range of topics including quarterly and
annual earnings, dividends, earnings forecasts, new stock issues, debt ﬁnancing,
mergers and acquisitions, antitrust actions, tender offers, new products and pro-
duction statistics, executive appointments and resignations and reactions to gov-
ernment regulations or court decisions (PR Newswire, 1996). These media press
releases are distinguished from internal memos that are directed to employees.
Each press release contains information that can inﬂuence how the media reports
ﬁrm behaviour and activities and thus may ultimately result in a change in the
ﬁrm’s reputation among various stakeholder groups (Paul, 2001). For example, a
release discussing a new product offering that is considered leading-edge technol-
ogy will likely be perceived by the ﬁrm’s stakeholders as enhancing the innovative-
ness dimension of reputation. Press releases about diversiﬁcation, acquisition or
divestiture signal to stakeholders the ﬁrm’s strategic choices and may have a
resultant impact on such reputational attributes as quality of management or
quality of products (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990).

Mass media advertising. Advertising is considered a credible reputation building
strategy (Weigelt and Camerer, 1988), and can be geared towards multiple stake-
holders (Schumann et al., 1991). As discussed by Fombrun and Shanley (1990),
economic models commonly view advertising as a source of product and imaging
cues that are designed to inﬂuence external publics. Scholars have found that
allocating resources towards advertising is effective at improving both overall
corporate reputation (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990) and perceived product quality
(Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). Mass media advertising is often aimed towards the
customer and is commonly found in such multimedia outlets as television, radio,
outdoor billboards, magazines, and newspapers. This advertising may focus on
product quality, corporate activity, social responsibility or other ﬁrm activities
(Schumann et al., 1991) that are central to a ﬁrm’s reputation. Advertising that is
directed to mass media outlets differs from other stakeholder advertising that is
directed towards such outlets as trade magazines and industry periodicals, which
are aimed primarily at suppliers, retailers or other industry stakeholders.

In sum, similar to impression management at the individual level, a variety of
communication devices allow a ﬁrm’s members to signal key activities to the ﬁrm’s
various stakeholders. What motivates the decision as to when to allocate resources,
and what type of RMA are to be used is the topic of the remaining sections.
Figure 1 indicates that both situational and stakeholder factors as well as actor
(TMG) characteristics inﬂuence that process.

Situational Factors

Impression management theory has found that situational stimuli provide cues to
the actors as to when and what type of behaviour might be appropriate. For

example, actors are more likely to engage in impression management behaviour
when they ﬁnd themselves in predicaments that threaten their image (Schlenker,
1980). Noted in the left hand boxes of Figure 1, one situational factor which
predicts RMA is organizational visibility among various audience groups. This
key situational factor has been explored at the individual level as the ‘publicness’
of the actor’s actions. Scholars have found that the more public one’s behaviour
is, the more likely one is to be concerned with how this behaviour appears to
others (House, 1980; Leary and Kowalski, 1990; Morrison and Bies, 1991) and
the more likely impression management behaviour will be motivated. This vis-
ibility is both a function of the probability of actor behaviour being observed and
the number of others who might either see it or learn about it (Leary and Kow-
alski, 1990). Thus, audience awareness of actor behaviour increases impression
management motivation.

Crossing to the organizational level of analysis, the motivation to manage cor-
porate reputation is also likely to rise as the visibility of the ﬁrm increases. Indeed,
scholars outside of the impression management arena have similarly argued that
visibility of the ﬁrm encourages greater motivation for organizational members to
behave in ways that key stakeholders may ﬁnd most satisfying. For example, it has
been argued that ﬁrms that are frequently the topic of media coverage may be
more concerned with managing their reputations (Wartick, 1992), particularly in
the eyes of the media, who serve to inﬂuence multiple stakeholders through inter-
media inﬂuence (Breed, 1980; Reese and Danielian, 1989). Pfeffer and Salancik
(1978), using resource dependence arguments, argue that ﬁrms that are more
visible to the public are increasingly more likely to face pressure to adapt to
external expectations and have an increased incentive to control the scrutiny of
their ﬁrm. Meznar and Nigh (1995) suggest that large, visible ﬁrms that face
external social pressure may engage in advocacy advertising and public relations
campaigns or even increase all public relations activities to alter social expectations
or the public’s perception of the ﬁrm’s activities. In sum, research at the individual
level has indicated that visibility encourages higher levels of impression manage-
ment, and research at the organizational level has suggested a similar relationship.
But to what stakeholder groups are these efforts geared? And what types of RMA
might be selected? I now turn to these questions.

Audience (Stakeholder) Factors

Audience members are a critical element of the impression management process.
Not only do audience members’ deﬁnitions of the situation inﬂuence how they
react to actor behaviour (Schneider, 1981), but the characteristics of the audience
inﬂuence the deﬁnition of the situation for the actors as well (Gardner and Mar-
tinko, 1988). For example, as the actor’s perceptions of the audiences’ power and
status increase, their self-awareness is heightened ( Jones and Wortman, 1973;

Schlenker, 1980), which is proposed to inﬂuence the type and increase the quantity
of impression management behaviour (Gardner and Martinko, 1988; Schlenker,
1980). People are more motivated to manage their impressions in front of audi-
ences that are more powerful, have higher status, are attractive, or are more likable
than for those audiences who are less so (Leary and Kowalski, 1990; Schlenker,
1980). Moreover, when a person is dependent on others for valued outcomes, the
individual is more motivated to engage in impression management (Leary and
Kowalski, 1990). Thus, certain audience factors inﬂuence impression management
behaviour at the individual level.

Audience factors are likewise important for impression management behaviour
at the organizational level. Unfortunately, empirical research in organizational
level impression management has typically neglected the role that the audience
plays in affecting organizational behaviour (Ginzel et al., 1993), thus, we know little
about the inﬂuence of the audience on RMA to date. An audience for a ﬁrm
consists of multiple groups that are likely to have different attitudes, beliefs and
expectations about a company (Bromley, 1993; Clarkson, 1995; Freeman, 1984).
These audience groups are commonly referred to in the organizational literature as
stakeholders. Stakeholders include customers, suppliers, communities, employees,
investors, the media, and any group that affects or can be affected by the company
(Fombrun, 1996; Freeman, 1984). The saliency of these stakeholder groups to
management is likely to have a strong effect on how management may act towards
them (Mitchell et al., 1997). Paralleling arguments set forth in impression manage-
ment theory, Mitchell et al. (1997) argue that both power and legitimacy, as well as
the urgency of stakeholder claims increases the saliency of stakeholders to man-
agement, encouraging increased actions towards those groups. Two audience
groups that will be examined further are the media and consumer.

Media audiences. The media serves to communicate a ﬁrm’s actions and has a major
role in the building and maintenance of a ﬁrm’s reputation (Deephouse, 2000;
Deephouse and Carter, 2005; Hooghiemstra, 2000; Mahon, 2002). In essence, as
the media increasingly attends to a ﬁrm’s actions by publishing increasing numbers
of articles about the ﬁrm, the ﬁrm becomes more visible to its multiple stakeholders
(Mahon, 2002; Wartick, 1992). These stakeholders will scan, detect, interpret and
prioritize media exposure data and form their perceptions of corporate reputation
(Wartick, 1992). As the media increases their attention on a ﬁrm, management may
likewise view the media as a more powerful and legitimate stakeholder. The
visibility brought on by the media can thus serve to increase the media’s saliency in
the eyes of the TMG, and can inﬂuence their desire to engage in RMA aimed at
controlling media written stories (Meznar and Nigh, 1995). Using press releases
with such impression management tactics as exemplifying, promoting, disclaiming
or ingratiating may allow a TMG to manage the media’s impression of the ﬁrm.

Consumer audiences. Another key stakeholder group for many ﬁrms is the consumer
of the ﬁrm’s products or services. Retail stores or consumer goods manufacturers
often require a great degree of communication and impression management
behaviour towards the general public and end-user. Empirical studies have shown
that those ﬁrms within the consumer goods manufacturing sector tend to engage in
advertising to a greater extent than others (Fombrun, 1996; Swerdlow and Blessios,
1993). On the other hand, many ﬁrms do not interact directly with the consumer,
and therefore have little need to communicate with the end-user of its products or
services. For example, raw materials suppliers often interact primarily with manu-
facturing companies rather than end-consumers and thus are likely to view the
manufacturing companies as more salient than end-consumers. Higher levels of
saliency of audience groups to the TMG will likely increase RMA towards those
groups.

In general then, as predicted by impression management and stakeholder
theory, the saliency to the TMG of any particular stakeholder group differs based
on the power and status of that group to the ﬁrm. The above examples illustrate
two audience groups that are more or less salient to a ﬁrm’s TMG based on
situational factors. That saliency in the TMG’s eyes may lead to a greater desire to
engage in impression management behaviour ( Jones and Wortman, 1973; Schlen-
ker, 1980), and the ﬁrm’s use of particularly appropriate types of RMA towards those
stakeholders should likewise increase (Gardner and Martinko, 1988; Schlenker,
1980). Thus, as the media increases a ﬁrm’s visibility through increasing publica-
tions, the ﬁrm may increase its RMA towards that group by increasing the number
of press releases it submits to the media. Similarly, ﬁrms that are highly visible to
the consumer are likely to increase RMA towards the consumer through such
mechanisms as mass media advertising.

Multiple audience inﬂuence. While saliency of certain audience groups might encour-
age RMA towards those groups, how might this affect a ﬁrm’s choice to engage in
reputation management towards other less salient groups? Mitchell et al. (1997)
argue that a central task of management is to sort and rank stakeholders to
determine which groups should receive management attention. Impression man-
agement theorists have argued that as the number of audience groups that must be
attended to increases, both information and strategic complexity increases for
organizational members. This complexity can limit the ability of the members to
adequately address concerns of their multiple stakeholders, and may contribute to
an over-weighting of the most salient information during decision making (Ginzel
et al., 1993). As Figure 1 indicates, this may decrease the use of RMA towards less
salient audience groups. These arguments suggest:

Proposition 1: Situational factors such as the visibility of the ﬁrm among certain
stakeholders will increase the use of speciﬁc types of reputation management

activities directed towards those stakeholders, and decrease reputation manage-
ment activities directed towards other stakeholders.

Hypothesis 1a: The greater the ﬁrm’s media visibility, the greater its use of media
directed reputation management activities (press releases).

Hypothesis 1b: The greater the ﬁrm’s consumer visibility, the greater its use of
consumer directed activities (mass media advertising).

Hypothesis 1c: The greater the ﬁrm’s media visibility, the less its use of consumer
directed activities (mass media advertising).

Hypothesis 1d: The greater the ﬁrm’s consumer visibility, the less its use of media
directed reputation management activities (press releases).

The Interaction of Actor (TMG) Characteristics

As indicated by the lower box in Figure 1, there is a predicted moderating effect of
the positive situational–RMA relationships based on actor (TMG) characteristics.[3]
While situational and audience factors may contribute to an actor’s deﬁnition of the
situation and subsequent choice to engage in impression management behaviour,
actor cognitions and characteristics are also inﬂuential to this process (Gardner and
Martinko, 1988). Cognitive scripts and role expectations create selective perception
and ﬁltering of information (Gioia and Manz, 1985) affecting the actor’s deﬁnition
of the situation and ultimate impression management behaviour. Also certain
characteristics, such as status and ability (Schlenker, 1980), help to shape an actor’s
self-image, which in turn inﬂuences the actor’s presentation to others.

The actor’s process of selective perception, interpretation of stimuli and subse-
quent actions as set forth by impression management theory is very similar to how
upper-echelons scholars have noted that TMGs act in their decision making arena
(Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1990; Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Hambrick and
Mason (1984) posit that TMGs make decisions on behalf of the ﬁrm through the
use of generalized rules that act as a ﬁltering process leading to a limited ﬁeld of
vision due to bounded rationality, selective perception and interpretation. Many
characteristics of the upper-echelon members, from their values, education, func-
tional background and the like, to their socioeconomic roots, each provide a ﬁlter
that can inﬂuence their deﬁnition of the situation and choice of behaviour. Ham-
brick and Mason (1984) thus argue that organizational outcomes, such as strategic
choices and subsequent performance levels, are partially predicted by character-
istics and composition of the TMG.

Daboub et al. (1995) argue that TMG characteristics are likely to moderate the
relationship between internal and external factors on such organizational behav-

iour as corporate illegal activity. I similarly argue that TMG characteristics help to
shape the deﬁnition of the situation for the TMG and thus will moderate the
relationship between situational factors and RMA.

Proposition 2: The relationship of situational and stakeholder factors to reputa-
tion management activities will be moderated by TMG characteristics.

Three characteristics will be examined: functional background, educational level,
and TMG tenure. These characteristics have been widely examined in the upper-
echelons literature (Carpenter, 2002; Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1996) and have
links to certain characteristics at the individual level that have been argued to
inﬂuence impression management behaviour.

Functional background. Managers with differing histories of functional experience
are likely to have different attitudes, knowledge, and perceptions (Dearborn and
Simon, 1958; Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Waller et al., 1995). Functional back-
ground may serve to impact the schema an individual forms regarding causal
relationships and their perception of the importance of certain variables to orga-
nizational effectiveness. Hambrick and Mason (1984) classiﬁed functional areas
into three categories which have been used extensively in subsequent upper-
echelons studies. They proposed that ‘output functions’ (marketing, sales and
product R&D) are responsible for growth, the search for new domain opportunities
and monitoring and adjusting products and markets . . . ; ‘throughput’ functions
(production, process engineering and accounting) emphasize improving the efﬁ-
ciency of the transformation process . . . ; and ‘peripheral’ functions (law and
ﬁnance) are not integrally involved with core activities.

I argue that TMGs with an output function orientation are more likely to
recognize the importance of managing their ﬁrm’s reputation under certain cir-
cumstances, such as when a ﬁrm’s visibility is heightened, than TMGs without this
orientation. This argument is based on impression management ﬁndings regarding
the inﬂuence of cognitions and characteristics on impression management behav-
iour. Scholars have found that cognitive scripts help individuals to perceive, under-
stand, and deﬁne the situation with which they are faced, helping them to make
decisions (Gioia and Manz, 1985). Cognitive scripts are ‘learned and reﬁned
through repeated social exchanges sharing similar elements or patterns’ (Gardner
and Martinko, 1988, p. 328). Individuals who have learned from functional train-
ing and experience to be especially attuned to their audience groups are likely to
have cognitive scripts that help them deﬁne a situation in such a way that they
perform so as to satisfy audience expectations (Gioia and Manz, 1985).

Similarly, it is likely that TMG members who have output oriented backgrounds
that promote monitoring markets and searching for new domains will have devel-
oped cognitive scripts that emphasize externally focused activities. For example,

S. M. Carter

Hambrick and Mason (1984) argued that output oriented TMGs will emphasize
external strategies such as increased advertising. Also, Simerly (2003) hypothesized
that ﬁrms with output oriented TMGs will have higher levels of corporate social
performance. In contrast, upper echelons scholars argue that throughput oriented
managers are acutely attuned to ﬁnancial issues, and likely to focus on short term
rather than long term performance measures (Hayes and Abernathy, 1980).
Because these throughput oriented managers are likely to have cognitive scripts
that focus on efﬁciency and proﬁtability (more internally focused goals), these
throughput managers may be less likely to react substantially to external stake-
holder visibility changes. Indeed, when Simerly (2003) found a negative relation-
ship between throughput oriented top managers and corporate
social
performance, he concluded that managers with output oriented backgrounds may
be more sensitive to external perceptions and therefore potentially more responsive
to the type of problems that may reduce the reputation of the ﬁrm. Speciﬁcally:

Hypothesis 2a: The positive relationship between the ﬁrm’s media visibility and
its press releases will be enhanced the higher the number of TMG members
whose primary functional background is output based.

Hypothesis 2b: The positive relationship between the ﬁrm’s consumer visibility
and its mass media advertising will be enhanced the higher the number of TMG
members whose primary functional background is output based.

Educational level. Impression management theory suggests that ability and skill are
associated with the use of certain types of impression management behaviour as
well as its ultimate effectiveness (Gurevitch, 1984). Ralston (1985) indicates that the
uniqueness of subordinates’ skills is an important element in determining the
degree to which the subordinates are able to impress their superiors. These unique
skills may be obtained in part, through their educational experience (Hambrick
and Mason, 1984). Indeed, upper-echelons studies have found higher educational
levels to be associated with greater degrees of innovation in organizations (Bantel
and Jackson, 1989), and with members providing unique solutions to problems.
Moreover, high levels of education have been found to be associated with a high
capacity for information processing and an ability to discriminate among a variety
of stimuli (Wiersema and Bantel, 1992). Although there has not been reported
evidence in impression management studies of a link between educational level and
impression management behaviour speciﬁcally, the skills and high information
processing ability obtained through increased education (Wiersema and Bantel,
1992) may provide TMG members with a similar skill set found at the individual
level that increases the understanding of when impression management behaviour
is needed. Therefore, ﬁrms whose TMGs are, on average, more highly educated

may recognize that the situational factor of visibility provides an appropriate time
for increased levels of RMA. Speciﬁcally,

Hypothesis 3a: The positive relationship between the ﬁrm’s media visibility and its
press releases will be enhanced the higher the average TMG formal education.

Hypothesis 3b: The positive relationship between the ﬁrm’s consumer visibility
and its mass media advertising will be enhanced the higher the average TMG
formal education.

TMG tenure. Deﬁning the situation through the eyes of the TMG also requires an
examination of a factor commonly argued to increasingly ﬁlter the amount of
information interpreted by the TMG – tenure. Upper-echelons research has long
suggested that the tenure of executives affects their cognitions which, in turn,
inﬂuences their behaviour (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1996). Tenure has been
argued to be associated with commitment to established policies and practices and
the development of predictable routines for dealing with information (Katz, 1982).
The most frequently cited underlying process proposed to be in effect is commitment
to the status quo – deﬁned as the executive’s belief in the enduring correctness of
current organizational policies and proﬁles (Hambrick et al., 1993). Tenure has been
found to have a signiﬁcant positive effect on commitment to the status quo (Ham-
brick et al., 1993). Empirical studies examining tenure and strategies have been quite
consistent in their ﬁndings and have found that higher tenure reduces strategic
change (Wiersema and Bantel, 1992), and increases strategic persistence (Finkelstein
and Hambrick, 1990). Moreover, scholars have shown that longer tenures are
associated with a choice to engage in strategies that are internally focused rather than
externally focused (i.e. Defender rather than Prospector strategies) (Chaganti and
Sambharya, 1987; Thomas et al., 1991). Aguilar (1967) found that as managers
increased their tenures within a ﬁrm, their reliance on external information sources
was greatly reduced. These arguments suggest that as the TMG’s tenure increases,
such situational elements as visibility are less likely to invoke the TMG into changing
its ﬁrm’s strategic actions. Instead, TMGs may become more committed to the
status quo, thus giving less attention to changing external conditions. These argu-
ments suggest we are less likely to see an effect between situational elements such as
visibility and RMA as TMG tenure increases. Thus:

Hypothesis 4a: The positive relationship between the ﬁrm’s media visibility and
its press releases will be dampened the higher the average TMG tenure.

Hypothesis 4b: The positive relationship between the ﬁrm’s consumer visibility
and its mass media advertising will be dampened the higher the average TMG
tenure.

METHODOLOGY

The target population for this study was a set of the largest Fortune 500 companies
across a wide set of industries. The sample of ﬁrms was derived from those ﬁrms
included in Fortune’s widely known corporate reputation survey (known as the Most
Admired Survey) in order to have control measures for the corporate reputation of
the ﬁrm. This survey examines the ten largest companies in terms of sales in each
of approximately 32 industries. A stratiﬁed random sample of 17 industries and
seven ﬁrms per industry was obtained, yielding a total of 119 ﬁrms. This sample
thus contained the largest ﬁrms in the Fortune 500, with a wide range of product and
service offerings, and a wide range of reputations, from poor to excellent.[4] Banks
and ﬁnancial institutions were excluded from the sample due to different reporting
requirements. Four years of data were collected (1989–92), and the data pooled,
yielding a total sample size of 476 ﬁrm-years. This timeline was considered appro-
priate because both the survey methodology and the ﬁrms included were relatively
stable over this period (Fortune). Missing data brought the ﬁnal model sample size
down to 345.

Data were collected from numerous secondary archival sources as listed below.
Additionally, all TMG demographic data were obtained from Dun and Bradstreet’s
Reference Book of Corporate Managements and Standard and Poor’s Register of Corpora-
tions, Directors, and Executives. All ﬁnancial data were obtained from Standard and
Poor’s COMPUSTAT industrial and business segment data, except where noted
explicitly.

Dependent Variables

Press releases. A measure of the number of press releases a ﬁrm submits in a given
year was based on issuances by the two primary major sources of wire services, PR
Newswire, and Business Wire. Topics included earnings, dividends, earnings fore-
casts, new stock issues, debt ﬁnancing, mergers and acquisitions, antitrust actions,
tender offers, new products and production statistics, executive’s appointments and
resignations and reactions to government regulations or court decisions. Using
both sources provided all press releases submitted, and duplications were elimi-
nated from the count.[5] The range of this variable was 0 to 509.

Mass media advertising. The measure used for advertising expenditures was obtained
from Arbitron multi-media service (AD$ Summary). Expenditures are reported by
Arbitron if a company spent more than $25,000 per year in the ten media types
measured: syndicated television, cable television, network radio, national spot
radio, outdoor, network television, spot television, magazines, Sunday magazines,
and newspapers. Because some advertising is focused solely on brand marketing as
opposed to corporate reputation management, a diversiﬁcation control variable

(see control section below) was used to control for ﬁrms less likely to use corporate
advertising as opposed to brand advertising strategies (Schumann et al., 1991). In
order to obtain meaningful data for all ﬁrms, including those whose advertising was
not reported in the above data source, an artiﬁcial score was constructed for ﬁrms
with missing data, where the advertising level was equal to 1 per cent of the ﬁrm’s
gross sales (Murray et al., 1993), leading to a conservative examination of adver-
tising expenditures across all ﬁrms. In all cases where advertising intensity
exceeded 1 per cent of gross sales, advertising expenditures were available on
Schedule X of the ﬁrm’s 10-K as required by the SEC. Tests not including the
artiﬁcial scores were similar to what is reported here and are available from the
author. The measure used was advertising intensity, total expenditures divided by
total sales.

Independent Variables

Media visibility. This measure was the number of articles written about a ﬁrm in a
given year, from a count of articles from ﬁve major newspapers. Mentions of each
ﬁrm in these newspapers over each 12-month period (including 1988–92) were
identiﬁed using an electronic search of headlines for company names on LEXIS/
NEXIS. The newspapers selected were based on a broad national coverage, and
included the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago
Tribune, and the Boston Globe. The number of times the ﬁrm was mentioned in the
headlines was summed to yield a total media exposure score, similar to the visibility
measure used by Meznar and Nigh (1995) and Fombrun and Shanley (1990).
Scores ranged from 0 to 340. Because the distribution for the number of media
articles was skewed, the logarithmic transformation of this score was used, consis-
tent with Rowe et al. (2003).

Consumer visibility. Dummy variables were used to indicate whether or not the ﬁrms
interacted primarily with an end consumer based on their primary SIC code. This
classiﬁcation, based on Swerdlow and Blessios (1993), was either non-durable
goods, retail and services, or those included in other classiﬁcations such as con-
struction, mining, and durable goods other than retail.

Top management group. The TMG was deﬁned as the two highest levels of manage-
ment within a ﬁrm (Wiersema and Bantel, 1992). These positions include: Chair-
man, CEO, President, COO, CFO and the most senior level of Vice President.

TMG output based background. TMG functional background is a categorical variable
based on each TMG member’s predominant functional background categorized as
follows: production, process engineering, or accounting represent throughput
backgrounds; marketing, sales, or product R&D each represent output background

specialization; and law or ﬁnance represent peripheral backgrounds (Hambrick
and Mason, 1984). This measure was a count of the number of TMG members
with output based experience.

TMG educational level. Educational level is an ordinal variable indicating the level of
education obtained by each of the members of the TMG (Wiersema and Bantel,
1992). It takes on values from 1 to 6 where 1 = high-school only, 2 = some college,
3 = undergraduate degree only, 4 = master’s degree (including a JD), 5 = PhD or
MD degree, and 6 = post-doctoral work. The data were then averaged across the
TMG members to obtain the TMG educational level score. The higher the score,
the greater the TMG educational level.

TMG tenure. Group tenure was measured by the length of time each group
member had been on the TMG in year t averaged across members (Finkelstein and
Hambrick, 1990). The higher the score, the longer the group was together.

Control Variables

Because of the use of panel data, there is a concern that time related effects can bias
the estimators. Therefore, to reduce the impact of potential period effects, Macro-
economic trends were controlled using a dummy variable for each year of the four
years examined. The omitted year was 1992. Some industries may engage in
greater RMA than others (Swerdlow and Blessios, 1993). Thus, industry was
controlled by Industry sales growth which was based on a one-year growth measure.
Impression management theory suggests that the favourability of the situation
inﬂuences impression management behavior (Leary and Kowalski, 1990) and
corporate reputation (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Thus, the headlines of the
articles discussed above were coded into three categories, positive, negative and
neutral. Coding instructions may be obtained from the author and were based on
similar coding schemes developed by Fombrun and Shanley (1990) and Deephouse
(1995). Reliability using three coders in total and independently coding the head-
lines resulted in a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.915 (Holsti, 1969). This level of interrater
reliability is considered high. A total of 15,231 total articles were coded for the full
sample. These categories were used to calculate the Janis–Fadner coefﬁcient of
imbalance ( Janis and Fadner, 1965), which measures the relative proportion of
positive/neutral and negative media articles for each ﬁrm. This measure, Favorabil-
ity of media exposure, is represented in this equation:

Coefﬁcient of Imbalance = P 2 - PN

(

) P + N

(

)2 if P > N;

(
  PN - n2

) P + N

(

)2 if  N > P; or 0 if P = N.

where P = number of positive/neutral media citations in a given year, and
N = number of negative media citations in a given year.

Impression management theory indicates that certain constraints, such as role
constraints, or inaccessibility to an audience will prevent impression management
behaviour (Gardner and Martinko, 1988; Leary and Kowalski, 1990). Similarly, it
is likely that the ﬁrm’s availability of resources would affect its use of RMA
(Fombrun, 1996). Thus, Availability of resources was measured as debt to equity.
Previous reputation has also been posited to inﬂuence impression management
behaviour (Gardner and Martinko, 1988). Corporate reputation was measured using
Fortune’s corporate reputation survey data composite score, which includes the
attributes of quality of management; quality of products or services; long-term
investment value; innovativeness; ﬁnancial soundness; ability to attract, develop,
and keep talented people; community and environmental responsibility; and use of
corporate assets (see Wartick, 2002 for a discussion of measuring corporate repu-
tation). Others have tested this measure for validity as well as reliability and found
them sufﬁcient for this database (Szwajkowski and Figlewicz, 1999). The size of the
ﬁrm is likely related to the degree to which the ﬁrm chooses to signal its activities
to stakeholders (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). Consistent with Fombrun and Shanley
(1990) and others (Dalton and Kesner, 1983), Size of the ﬁrm was the log of total sales.
Log of number of employees was used to reduce multicollinearity concerns in the
advertising regression. It has been suggested that ﬁrms with higher levels of diver-
siﬁcation are less likely to have a good reputation because audiences may receive
more ambiguous and distorted signals regarding the ﬁrm’s strategies (Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990). Thus, Degree of diversiﬁcation was controlled using an entropy
measure (Palepu, 1985) which measures the extent to which a ﬁrm operates in a
number of industries, using a weighted average of the proportion of a ﬁrm’s sales
in each reported industry segment where Diversiﬁcation = SPiln(1/Pi), and Pi is the
proportion of the ﬁrm’s sales that are from segment i. TMG size was controlled
because of the size-dependency of some TMG characteristic measures. TMG size
was the number of TMG members. For this sample, average TMG size was about
ﬁve. Because heterogeneity of the TMG has been found to enhance the ﬁrm’s
ability to undergo changes in corporate strategy (Wiersema and Bantel, 1992),
measures for Functional background heterogeneity (Blau’s measure, Carpenter, 2002) and
Tenure heterogeneity were examined and found to be non-signiﬁcant in the equations.
Because the heterogeneity measures brought the overall signiﬁcance of the models
down, these measures were not included in the reported models. Following
Fombrun and Shanley (1990), all control variables were lagged by one year.

Statistical Methods

The method of analysis was general least squares (GLS) cross-sectional time-series
regression using a random effects model. The statistical package STATA was used.
Because the data include both cross-sectional and time-series components, the data
were pooled to include each of the years for which information was obtained,

yielding statistics that indicate the average effect of the independent variables over
the full period. This allowed a larger database, a greater number of degrees of
freedom, and thus, more precise estimates. Because Ordinary Least Squares
Regression (OLS) may yield biased estimates due to enduring individual-ﬁrm
characteristics not considered in the model (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1990), it
was critical to correct for any potential biases. Due to the pooling of data, gener-
alized least squares estimators were used. Because my theoretical interest was in
differences across ﬁrms, a random effects model was selected. The random effects
estimators are the most efﬁcient because they model both within and across ﬁrm
variation ( Judge et al., 1982). Hausman Speciﬁcation tests were conducted
( Greene, 1993, p. 479; Hausman; 1978; Judge et al., 1982) and indicated that the
random effects models were fully speciﬁed and did not differ signiﬁcantly from
ﬁxed effects models (press release model, c2 = 18.21, prob ⬎ c2 = 0.15; advertising
model, c2 = 11.48, prob ⬎ c2 = 0.57). The Breusch and Pagan (1980) Lagrange
multiplier test for random effects, testing that Var (ni ) = 0, was conducted with the
assumption met in each of the models (c2 = 342.50, c2 = 393.86 respectively).
Results obtained through the Huber/White/sandwich estimator (White, 1980)
suggested no signiﬁcant heteroscedasticity. A computation of sample size require-
ments, based on the number of independent and control variables entered into the
regression equations, a medium effect size (half a standard deviation between
means), and an alpha level of 0.01 indicated the sample size was adequate to
reduce the threat of a Type II error to a minimum (power of 0.90) (Cohen, 1992).

RESULTS

Means, standard deviations, and correlations are presented in Table I. Tables II
and III contain regression models predicting frequency of press releases, and mass
media advertising intensity respectively. The ﬁrst model illustrates the c2 goodness
of ﬁt for the control variables, Model I adds the visibility variable by audience type,
and Model II adds the TMG moderator variables.

Several control variables are signiﬁcant. Importantly, size of the ﬁrm is positively
related to the use of press releases (p ⬍ 0.001). More diversiﬁed ﬁrms are less likely
to use press releases (p ⬍ 0.05). The advertising intensity model indicates a nega-
tive and signiﬁcant relationship between the size of the ﬁrm and advertising
intensity (p ⬍ 0.001) indicating that smaller ﬁrms tend to spend a larger percent-
age of their sales on advertising. Also, the ﬁrm’s corporate reputation is negatively
related to its advertising intensity in the full model (p ⬍ 0.05).

The addition of the Visibility variables was a signiﬁcant improvement over the
Control Models for both dependent variables. A c2 likelihood-ratio test comparing
the relative goodness of ﬁt between the Control Model and Model I shows a
signiﬁcantly improved ﬁt for the data (for press releases, change in c2 = 40.29,
change in df = 2, p ⬍ 0.001, for advertising intensity, change in c2 = 46.79, change

As hypothesized in Hypothesis 1a, the greater the media visibility, the greater the
ﬁrm’s use of press releases (p ⬍ 0.001). Hypothesis 1b was likewise supported,
indicating that ﬁrms that have high levels of consumer visibility used mass media
advertising to a greater extent than others (p ⬍ 0.001). Moreover, there is a
signiﬁcant negative relationship between consumer visibility and press release use
(p ⬍ 0.01), providing support for Hypothesis 1c, and evidence that the choice of
RMA is based on the signiﬁcance of the audience member. However, Hypothesis
1d was not supported – media visibility had no relationship to mass media adver-
tising. Thus, the hypothesized negative relationship between visibility with one
stakeholder and RMA towards another had mixed support.

For the hypothesized moderator variables, in both RMA cases, the addition of
the TMG characteristics as interactions was a signiﬁcant improvement over the

control models. A c2 likelihood-ratio test comparing the relative goodness of ﬁt
between Model I and Model II shows a signiﬁcantly improved ﬁt for the data (for
press releases, change in c2 = 40.07, change in df = 3, p ⬍ 0.001, for advertising
intensity, change in c2 = 17.63, change in df = 3, p ⬍ 0.001).[6]

Tables II and III both indicate support for the interactive relationships of
Hypotheses 2a and 2b. That is, the positive relationship of media and consumer
visibility to the use of press releases and mass media advertising intensity was
enhanced as the number of TMG members with output based functional back-
grounds increased (p ⬍ 0.001 for press releases; and p ⬍ 0.05 for advertising).[7]
There is also support for Hypotheses 3a and 3b. That is, the positive relationship
of media and consumer visibility to the use of press releases and mass media
advertising was further enhanced the higher the average TMG education level
(p ⬍ 0.01 for press releases; p ⬍ 0.01 for advertising). Hypothesis 4a predicted a
negative effect in the interactive relationship between average TMG tenure and

RMA. However, Tables II and III show that this hypothesis was not supported for
either press releases or mass media advertising intensity. Contrary to the hypoth-
esized dampening effect, average TMG tenure is actually positive and signiﬁcantly
related to the use of both press releases (p ⬍ 0.05) and mass media advertising
intensity (p ⬍ 0.01).

The positive effect of the interactions above suggests an enhancing rather than
a dampening effect on the dependent variables, in all cases. However, it is pos-
sible that the signs of the relationships could differ signiﬁcantly depending on the
level of TMG attributes being examined. Thus, the regressions were decomposed
using the procedure outlined by Jaccard et al. (1990), which involved estimating
the slopes of the interaction models based on the relationship between the situ-
ational variables and RMA at both high and low levels of each TMG attribute.
Results showed no signiﬁcant differences between low and high levels of
attributes, indicating similar relationships at various levels across the spectrum of
observations.

DISCUSSION

Major Findings

Using impression management theory coupled with an upper-echelons perspec-
tive, this study found the interaction of situational, stakeholder, and TMG factors
is signiﬁcantly associated with certain types of RMA of a ﬁrm. This research
examined the previously neglected audience and actor interaction at the orga-
nizational level, which is argued to provide the actor’s deﬁnition of the situation
that ultimately inﬂuences the actor’s behaviour. Examining the situational
element of visibility, I found that when ﬁrm visibility increased among certain
stakeholder groups, that factor predicted certain types of RMA towards those
stakeholder groups, consistent with other studies. I found mixed evidence that
multiple stakeholder visibility actually reduces certain types of RMA towards the
less visible stakeholder groups. Importantly, I found that TMG characteristics
signiﬁcantly interacted with visibility to further predict RMA, providing evidence
as to why some ﬁrms manage their corporate reputation differently than others.
Speciﬁcally, TMG functional background had a signiﬁcant positive interactive
effect with visibility for both the use of press releases and advertising intensity.
That is, ﬁrms that have output oriented TMGs appear to place more emphasis
on signalling the ﬁrm’s reputation in situations of high ﬁrm visibility among
certain audience groups. Cognitive scripts and role expectations are the unob-
served mechanism argued to account for this relationship. Average TMG edu-
cational level had a signiﬁcant interactive effect as well. Results indicated that
more highly educated TMGs are more likely to spend resources on reputation
management using press releases and advertising towards stakeholder groups in

1167

highly visible situations, perhaps because the TMGs use their increased skill sets
obtained through their educational experience to better recognize the need for
reputation management.

Finally, the relationship between average TMG tenure and the use of RMA was
contrary to the hypothesized relationship. Most upper-echelons studies have
argued that commitment to the status quo is more likely as TMGs increase their
group tenure. Moreover, other studies have suggested that TMGs become more
internally focused over time and less reliant on outside signals. This suggests that
such elements as ﬁrm visibility would be less likely to encourage the TMG to
promote higher levels of RMA. My ﬁndings were contrary to this view. Instead, I
found that longer tenured groups were more likely to use RMA towards particular
stakeholder groups in the situation of increasing ﬁrm visibility. Research on
strength of identiﬁcation with an organization sheds light on the possible underly-
ing processes, unobserved in this study, that may explain this outcome. Scholars
have suggested that tenure is likely to promote higher levels of identiﬁcation with
the ﬁrm, and might inﬂuence an employee’s actions on the job (Dutton et al.,
1994). Speciﬁcally, when an individual’s identiﬁcation with the ﬁrm is closely tied
to his/her own self image, that individual is argued to be more concerned with the
ﬁrm’s reputation (Chatman et al., 1986). Perhaps it is this identiﬁcation that leads
to a greater motivation to use RMA on behalf of the ﬁrm for TMGs with longer
tenures.

Several control variables also indicated interesting relationships. For example,
there was a negative relationship between corporate reputation and advertising.
That is, the higher the corporate reputation, the lower the advertising intensity.
This suggests that ﬁrms may use reputation as a slack resource and change their
allocation of resources based on their past levels of reputation. Moreover, the size
of the ﬁrm was negatively related to advertising intensity suggesting that as ﬁrms
grow larger and likely more visible, they may rely more on the media to commu-
nicate their actions to stakeholders to a greater degree than smaller ﬁrms.

Limitations and Future Research Directions

Several limitations that exist in this study are discussed below along with oppor-
tunities for future research. As Hambrick (1994) notes, the vast majority of TMG
research has not examined the causal, intervening mechanisms by which group
characteristics become reﬂected in organizational characteristics. This research is
no exception. As such, the perceptions and motivations of the TMG were not
actually measured and were only assumed to be present in this study. While this
study did not examine underlying processes, it did provide important evidence that
TMG characteristics may matter when predicting RMA. Clearly it would be
advantageous to further this study by exploring in depth through ﬁeld observation
or survey methodology what underlying processes are motivating this behaviour by

the TMG. For example, measuring direct skills and cognitions or personality traits
could give us a greater understanding of underlying processes. One could measure
the self-monitoring abilities of TMG members to assess their effects on reputation
signalling, allowing us to gain valuable insights into key underlying processes that
impact such behaviours.

By examining average levels of education and tenure, I assumed that the domi-
nant level of a characteristic leads to a particular orientation or preference set for
the TMG (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1996). However, the dispersion or similarity
of these characteristics among a TMG may also affect the decision making of the
TMG. For example, scholars have argued that the heterogeneity and homogene-
ity of the TMG may lead to different methods for processing information, such as
homogeneity leads to greater cohesiveness (Pfeffer, 1983) and heterogeneity
weakens consensus on goals (Priem, 1990) and/or leads to more comprehensive
decision making (Wiersema and Bantel, 1992). Preliminary tests within my study
examining heterogeneity measures did not yield signiﬁcant results. However,
scholars have suggested that one reason we may see conﬂicting evidence or no
support when we examine the heterogeneity of these characteristics is that we are
examining something that likely affects the process, not necessarily the outcome of
the decision-making process (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1996). Even so, future
testing may ﬁnd other TMG factors such as group cohesiveness or decision
making speed may provide important and signiﬁcant ﬁndings. Examining the
underlying ‘black box’ processes is an important next step to further these research
ﬁndings.

There is a paucity of empirical studies examining the effects of multiple audi-
ences on RMA (Ginzel et al., 1993). This study provided some mixed support that
an increase in awareness of particular stakeholders may limit a ﬁrm’s attention to
other stakeholder groups. However, future research should examine what happens
when there are two are more stakeholder groups that are simultaneously salient to
a ﬁrm. As Goffman (1959) notes, when actors must address multiple audiences
simultaneously the interaction becomes much more complicated and role confu-
sion may occur. Other impression management theorists argue that multiple
audiences increase the complexity of
the situation and the organizational
members’ use of simpliﬁed rules lead to lower quality decisions. Mitchell et al.
(1997) argue that managerial characteristics likely moderate the ability of TMGs
to determine the saliency of certain stakeholders and thus determine which stake-
holders will receive management attention. This may be particularly true when
TMGs attempt to sort stakeholders and attend to multiple groups. While exam-
ining the interaction of different salience levels of multiple stakeholders was
beyond the scope of this study, future research may ﬁnd this a lucrative area for
study.

Due to the complexity and simultaneous interactions of the variables at the
situational, actor and audience level, speciﬁc predictions are somewhat difﬁcult to

generate. This has certainly been a limitation of impression management theory
over time as discussed by Gardner and Martinko (1988). To reduce this complexity
in the empirical analysis, I limited my study to a single situational variable (visibility
among two audience groups) and examined the interactive relationship that vis-
ibility had with TMG characteristics in predicting two types of RMA. Future
studies could examine other situational variables that are not taken into account
here.

Advertising and press releases are certainly not all the signalling opportunities a
ﬁrm has at its disposal for managing reputation. While these activities may be
generalizable to most other types of reputation management behaviour because of
their applicability under a wide variety of circumstances and their ability to reach
multiple audience groups, some types of RMA may be considered to be more
appropriate under serious identity-threatening events. For example, under crisis
situations, stakeholders may demand press conferences and face-to-face exchanges
to clarify accounts by the TMG. In these situations, the effects of the choice of
RMA by the TMG may contribute to a differential effect on the ﬁrm’s reputation.
Therefore, future research could examine other RMA such as press conferences,
letters to shareholders and the like to determine how the TMG inﬂuences their use.
While this study only examined the frequency and intensity of certain RMA rather
than the speciﬁc content of those actions, future research could do so. Examining
the type of press releases submitted may reveal a pattern of obfuscation during
crisis periods, or perhaps defensive manoeuvring, etc.

Moreover, not all of the types of activities studied were necessarily deliberately
intended as RMA even if the actions resulted in changes to reputation. For example,
some press releases may be routinely required quarterly earning announcements.
While this type of press release may result in a change in the ﬁrm’s reputation, it
is likely that conscious efforts at RMA may be most easily controlled by the TMG.
Thus, examining only intentional reputation management behaviour may give us
a greater sense of how the TMG controls this organizational behaviour. For
example, certain press releases, termed preannouncements (Herbig and O’Hara,
1998) are deliberate attempts to assertively manage a ﬁrm’s reputation by commu-
nicating an intended action prior to the actual event. Future research could
examine the degree to which the TMG inﬂuences the deliberate use of RMA, as
opposed to both conscious and unconscious impression management behaviour
(Schlenker, 1980), through in depth ﬁeld observations or case studies.

The sample of ﬁrms in this study included only the largest Fortune 500 ﬁrms. In
these large ﬁrms, others outside the TMG, such as public relations personnel, are
typically given the authority to provide explanations for events that reﬂect the
TMG’s views (Ginzel et al., 1993). In the same spirit as Ginzel et al., I consider
these personnel to be legitimate extensions of top management, and therefore I
expect their explanations of events to be strongly inﬂuenced by the TMG’s views.
Even so, it is possible that CEOs and TMGs in smaller ﬁrms take a more active role

in communication processes involved in managing their ﬁrms’ reputations. Future
studies should examine RMA in small ﬁrms.

The measure of corporate reputation used in this study contains a ﬁnancial
performance ‘halo’ (Brown and Perry, 1994) because ﬁnancial analysts and indus-
try experts are the stakeholder groups that rate the ﬁrms on their various attributes
in Fortune’s survey. While the reported measure likely inﬂuences the TMG’s per-
ception of how others view their ﬁrm, this bias towards ﬁnancial performance likely
limits the proper perception to the ﬁnancial community. Future research could
examine how reputation in the eyes of other key stakeholders outside of the
ﬁnancial community, such as consumer groups or environmental groups might
inﬂuence the relationships studied here.

Additionally, as is the case with all cross-sectional designs, causality is always a
question. Since I was examining panel data, I was able to examine this possibility
by running reverse causal models. The results of the subsequent year lead regres-
sions showed that goodness of ﬁt was lower in all cases (press releases, goodness of
ﬁt fell to 78.10 versus 132.80, for advertising, goodness of ﬁt fell to 40.62 versus
91.88). The output function background remained signiﬁcant in the press release
model and the average education interaction remained signiﬁcant in the advertis-
ing model but all other TMG variables lost their signiﬁcance in the full models.
This suggests that a reverse causality situation is not likely in effect. Nonetheless,
cross-sectional studies are always susceptible to reverse causality, and thus this
limitation is noted.

Although this study did not take into consideration the audience’s subsequent
evaluation of the RMA, it is important that future research do so. Indeed, as
Ashforth and Gibbs (1990) note, it is possible that ﬁrms in certain situations may be
negatively viewed by audience groups as overemphasizing their actions when these
ﬁrms attempt to improve their legitimacy or reputation when signalling certain
ﬁrm actions to their audience members.

Implications

The descriptive nature of this study provides several theoretical and managerial
implications. While there are several situational factors that can predict RMA,
such as a ﬁrm’s industry, its size and a ﬁrm’s visibility in the eyes of key stakehold-
ers, the composition of the TMG seems to have a signiﬁcant interactive relation-
ship with those factors. Indeed, the ﬁndings here suggest that certain TMGs may
be more likely to recognize situational factors that could increase impression
management success and take advantage of those situations by using RMA to a
greater extent than others. This study thus suggests that the TMG is an important
predictor of why some ﬁrms attend to their corporate reputations more than
others.

As encouraged by Ginzel et al. (1993) and Bromley (2003), this study provides
important evidence that
there are considerable parallels between managing
individual reputations and corporate reputations. This research complements
previous studies that have used impression management theory to explain orga-
nizational behaviour (Elsbach, 1994; Elsbach and Sutton, 1992) by providing
evidence that organizational members behave on behalf of their organization
similarly to how they would in managing their own reputations. Perhaps even
more importantly, this study has suggested that certain factors can have a strong
impact on a TMGs collective choice to engage in RMA. This research is a ﬁrst
step towards determining how the TMG as the lead actor in an organizational
setting, promotes different levels of interaction with the audience based on their
composition and characteristics.

Scholars have suggested that TMG demographic studies have frequently over-
looked important moderating or intervening variables (Carpenter, 2002; Daboub
et al., 1995). The results of this study indicate that certain TMG characteristics
serve as moderators for the situational variable of visibility in predicting organiza-
tional behaviour. The TMGs represent an important part of the equation when
examining situations where decision making leads to actions to which the ﬁrm’s
management will likely be held accountable. Understanding these moderating
effects is an important goal of upper-echelons research.

Examining the effect that multiple stakeholders have on corporate reputation
management behaviour is critical to our understanding of organizational level
impression management behaviour. This study found some mixed evidence that as
a ﬁrm’s members attend to certain stakeholder groups they may simultaneously
reduce their attention towards other groups. Firms facing multiple audiences with
high levels of power and status may not have the luxury of ignoring less salient
audiences when addressing varying stakeholder concerns. Continued examination
of the effect of multiple audiences on RMA is warranted.

As researchers and practitioners become more aware of the advantages and
disadvantages of spending resources on managing the ﬁrm’s reputation,
it is
increasingly necessary to consider the composition of the TMG in determining the
needs of the ﬁrm. Because of the critical role that top management plays in regard
to promoting the ﬁrm’s reputation, it is important to recognize that certain factors
may inﬂuence how the TMG manages its ﬁrm’s reputation. This research is a ﬁrst
step towards examining these factors, and should encourage scholars to determine
how inﬂuential the underlying processes are to the ﬁrm’s activities.

In conclusion, this research indicates that the actor, audience and situation
interface is important in attempting to understand why some ﬁrms engage in more
extensive RMA than others. Anecdotal evidence suggests that RMA differs across
ﬁrms, but we have had little insight into what factors might inﬂuence those
differences. Using impression management theory and an upper-echelons perspec-
tive has allowed us a glimpse at what factors are most likely to inﬂuence that

relationship and how this may ultimately translate into greater levels of corporate
reputation and the potential for a competitive advantage.

NOTES

*This paper is based on the author’s dissertation. She would like to thank her committee members
Janet Dukerich, David Jemison, Tim Rueﬂi, George Huber and Ajay Kohli at the University of
Texas at Austin for their help with earlier drafts of this manuscript. She would also like to thank two
anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.
[1] Much of the work in the upper-echelons arena has used the terminology top management team
(TMT) as opposed to top management group. However, Hambrick (1994) suggests that the term
‘group’ better describes our understanding of the group’s role because the term ‘team’ connotes
more cohesion and group identity than may exist.

[2] Certainly not all impression management behaviour will produce the desired results, due in part
to audience expectations that are incongruent with actor’s perceptions of those expectations
(Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990; Gardner and Martinko, 1988). However, research at the organiza-
tional level has found that an increase in RMA such as advertising and other signalling behav-
iours generally increases a ﬁrm’s subsequent reputation or industry standing (Ferrier, 1997;
Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Testing the effectiveness of RMA is beyond the scope of this study,
since the focus here is on what interactive factors inﬂuence RMA, rather than how these activities
are perceived by stakeholders.

[3] While there may be similar moderating relationships between TMG characteristics and the
reduced use of RMA towards less salient stakeholders, such as proposed by Mitchell et al. (1997),
this exploration is beyond the scope of this study.

[4] The ﬁrms in this sample had a mean reputation score of 6.34 and a median of 6.42 on a possible
score of 0–10, with a standard deviation of 1.01, a minimum of 1.99 and a maximum of 9.02. Ten
per cent of the ﬁrms scored below 4.91, while the top 10 per cent had scores above 7.51.

[5] Because multi-product ﬁrms would routinely have higher levels of new product press releases
than single-product ﬁrms due to the nature of their business, an alternate measure of press
releases which eliminated new product press releases from the count was also developed. Analysis
using this adjusted measure provided similar results to the unadjusted measure. Results are
available from the author.

[6] When including the interaction variables into the equation, the interpretation of the main effects
are different because the coefﬁcients in the two equations estimate different concepts. The main
effect only model estimates the effects of the independent variable on the dependent variable,
across the levels of the other independent variables, thus representing a general relationship. In
the model with the multiplicative terms, the regression coefﬁcients reﬂect conditional relation-
ships, that is, the case where all X variables but the one in question equal zero.

[7] To explore whether peripheral or throughput oriented TMGs were associated with different
levels of RMA, a post-hoc analysis was performed. Measures for throughput and peripheral
TMG member frequency were added to the Model I equation. Results for press releases showed
that while greater frequency of TMG members with output backgrounds was positive and
signiﬁcant (p ⬍ 0.01), neither peripheral nor throughput TMGs were signiﬁcantly related to
RMA use, as expected. For advertising intensity, both greater frequency among output and
peripheral TMGs was signiﬁcantly associated with RMA, while greater frequency of throughput
TMG members was not signiﬁcantly related to RMA.
