Abstract
Purpose – To develop money proﬁles based on money attitudes and investigate differences in
work-related attitudes across money proﬁles.
Design/methodology/approach – Data from 564 university students in the USA were collected
and four money proﬁles based on the Love of Money Scale (LOMS) were identiﬁed using cluster
analysis.
Findings – Achieving money worshipers (23.22 percent) have the highest scores on factors good,
respect, achievement, and power. Careless money admirers (30.16 percent) have the lowest scores on
factors budget and evil. Apathetic money managers (31.08 percent) have the lowest scores on factors
respect and achievement and the highest on budget. Money repellent Individuals (15.54 percent) have
the lowest scores on factors good and power and the highest on factor evil. Achieving money
worshipers have the highest level of organization-based self-esteem (OBSE), the protestant work ethic
(PWE), intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction, and satisfaction with social and self-actualization needs,
whereas money repellent individuals have the lowest. Apathetic money managers have the highest
level of satisfaction with physiological and safety needs.
Research limitations/implications – This convenience sample does not represent the national
population in general or student population in particular. Self-reported data from the same source at
one time can inﬂate relationships between variables and do not provide the cause-and-effect
relationship.
Practical implications – Researchers and managers understand that people in different money
proﬁles have different work-related attitudes and importance and satisfaction of human needs and that
they may identify human resource strategies to predict and control behavior in organizations.
Originality/value – The four money proﬁles, replicated in this study, are valid across several
cultures.

(Milkovich and Newman, 2005; Mitchell and Mickel, 1999; Opsahl and Dunnette, 1966;
Rynes and Gerhart, 2000; Wernimont and Fitzpatrick, 1972). Money is the instrument
of commerce and the measure of value (Smith, 1776/1937). Although money is used
universally, the meaning of money is in the eye of the beholder (McClelland, 1967).
People’s attitudes toward money are learned through the socialization process,
established early in childhood, and maintained in adult life. Money attitudes may be
used as a “frame of reference” to examine their everyday lives. Money is a motivator
for some (Gupta and Shaw, 1998; Lawler, 1971), but a hygiene factor for others
(Herzberg et al., 1959; Kohn, 1993; Pfeffer, 1998).

For the past two decades, global economic changes have enhanced the ﬂow of
money, human resources, technology, and products and services across borders (Tang
and Chiu, 2003). In the wake of downsizing and outsourcing, many organizations in the
USA and around the world (e.g. Japan) have outsourced their functions to many less
developed/developing countries (e.g. Mexico, China, India, and Vietnam), reduced
full-time core employees, and hired many part-time employees and temporary workers
in order to cut costs and increase proﬁts. Research suggests that full-time employees
are different from part-time employees and non-employed students regarding their
money attitudes, income, and life satisfaction (Tang et al., 2002b). Many research
studies have focused on full-time employees at work. Very little research has examined
non-full-time employees (Tang et al., 2002a, b). This study will ﬁll in the void.

This study will examine university students who do not work full time, but may
have part-time work experiences and may be non-employed students. We will examine
the following research questions: in a sample of university students, can researchers
identify people who are motivated by money, who are not motivated by money, and
who are somewhere in between? Do these different people with different money
attitudes have a different pattern of needs and work-related attitudes? To answer these
questions, we will examine people’s money attitudes using the love of money scale
(LOMS) (Tang, 1992), classify people into several money proﬁles based on cluster
analysis and the love of money, and examine the differences in intrinsic and extrinsic
job satisfaction, the protestant work ethic (PWE), organization-based self-esteem
(OBSE), and the importance and satisfaction of human needs across money proﬁles.
We will provide a brief review of the literature below.

Theory and hypothesis
There is a signiﬁcant increase regarding the importance of money in the USA and
around the world. According to Higher Education Research Institute, 75.1 percent of
freshman in 1993 said that the important reason in deciding to go on to college is “to
make more money”. Only 49.9 percent said so in 1971. In 1978, men ranked pay the ﬁfth
and women ranked pay the seventh in importance, among ten items (Jurgensen, 1978).
In 1990, among 11 work goals, pay has been ranked the second in importance in the
USA and the UK and the ﬁrst in Germany (Harpaz, 1990). Mitchell and Mickel (1999)
have published an article on the meaning of money in the Academy of Management
Review and concluded that the one consistent thread in this body of work is the
emphasis on its importance. Therefore, money has become more important than ever.
Very little research has investigated the relationships between money attitudes and job
satisfaction, the hierarchy of human needs, and other work-related attitudes in the
literature. We will introduce the love of money construct ﬁrst.


Money proﬁles

What is the love of money?
The ﬁrst question a scientiﬁc investigator must ask is not “How can I measure it?” but
rather, “What is it?” (Locke, 1969, p. 334). The inspiration to study “the love of money”
comes from a common belief: “The love of money is the root of evil” (Bible: 1 Timothy,
6: 10; Luna-Arocas and Tang, 2004; Tang and Chiu, 2003). The love of money is
strongly related to the concept of “greed” (Sloan, 2002, p. 37), has many negative
connotations, and has been considered as a taboo in many societies. It can be deﬁned
as:

(1) a measure of one’s values, wants (Locke, 1969), or desires of money (Sloan, 2002)

(2)

but not one’s “needs”; and
the meaning and the importance of money (Mitchell and Mickel, 1999) and one’s
own personal attitudes towards money.

There are many measures of money attitudes (Furnham and Argyle, 1998; Lim and
Teo, 1997). Mitchell and Mickel (1999) have considered the money ethic scale (MES)
(Tang, 1992) as one of the most “well-developed” and systematically used measures of
money attitude. Tang and his associates have developed several versions of the
multi-dimensional MES based on the ABC (affective, behavioral, and cognitive) model
of an attitude (Tang and Chiu, 2003; Tang et al., 2000). In order to make it practical and
easy to use, Tang and his associates have examined the LOMS that is a subset of the
MES. We will review the literature on the four money proﬁles that have been developed
based on the LOMS.

Money proﬁles
Tang and his associates have successfully identiﬁed four money proﬁles in several
studies. Luna-Arocas and Tang (2004) examined university professors in the USA and
Spain using the 15-item-5-factor LOMS (budget, evil, equity, success, and motivator)
and identiﬁed four money proﬁles: achieving money worshiper, careless money
admirer, apathetic money manager, and money repellent individual. Achieving money
worshipers (37.63 percent) have the most positive attitudes toward money. They
worship money as their success and budget money carefully. Money repellent
individuals (26.37 percent) have the most negative attitudes toward money. They
consider that money is evil and is not success. Careless money admirers (19.93 percent)
value Success but do not Budget money carefully. Apathetic money managers (16.08
percent) think that money is neither evil nor a motivator and have high intrinsic job
satisfaction and life satisfaction. They may adopt the simplicity movement, scaling
back, living on less, and liking it. These two clusters fall between these two extremes.
American business professors have the highest income among all different colleges in
that study and most of them (75 percent) are in the achieving money worshiper cluster.
Thus, high-income professors have the most positive attitudes toward money, the
highest satisfaction with pay and pay administration, the highest work ethic, and the
longest work experiences. Money repellent individuals have the most negative
attitudes toward money, the lowest income, the lowest work ethic, and the lowest
satisfaction with pay administration.

Tang et al. (n.d.) investigated university students and small business owners in
Skopje, the Republic of Macedonia and replicated the same four money proﬁles using
the same LOMS. For business owners, the largest cluster is achieving money worshiper

(45 percent) and the smallest one is apathetic money manager (6.7 percent). For
students, the largest money proﬁle is money repellent individual (53.6 percent). Those
who have money have the most positive attitudes toward money and are achieving
money worshipers. Furthermore, Du and Tang (2003) also replicated the four proﬁles
in a sample of university students in China: achieving money worshiper (28.77 percent),
careless money admirer (29.11 percent), apathetic money manager (31.50 percent), and
money repellent individual (10.62 percent). Thereby, the four money proﬁles can be
consistently identiﬁed in different cultures (China, Macedonia, Spain, and the USA).

The theoretical and empirical contributions of this study are listed below. We will

replicate the three aforementioned studies using:

(1) a different measure of the LOMS;
(2) a different sample; and
(3) a new set of variables for external validation purposes.

More speciﬁcally, we will use the 30-item-6-factor LOMS (i.e. the original MES; Tang,
1992) with the following factors: good, evil
(behavioral),
If similar money proﬁles can be
achievement, respect, and power (cognitive).
identiﬁed using different variables, in different samples, and in different external
validation variables, then, results of this study will greatly enhance the external
validity of the LOMS and money proﬁles. We will examine the following variables for
the external validity of the money proﬁles.

(affective), budget

The literature on the MES suggests that age and sex (female) are positively related
to factor budget (Tang, 1992). High-income people think that money represents their
achievement and money is not evil. Young people tend to see money as evil. Factor
achievement is negatively correlated with satisfaction of work, promotion, supervision,
and coworkers (Smith et al., 1975) and overall life satisfaction. Intrinsic job satisfaction
(Weiss et al., 1967) is associated with factor power, whereas extrinsic job satisfaction is
negatively associated with factor evil (Tang and Gilbert, 1995). The PWE (Blood, 1969)
is signiﬁcantly correlated with factors good, achievement, respect, and power. The
PWE (Mirels and Garrett, 1971) is correlated with factors evil, budget, and power
(Tang, 1992) and is related to factors achievement, respect, and evil (Tang, 1993).

their perception concerning the nature of

Intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction. When intrinsic and extrinsic rewards are both
very high (low), people may mistakenly infer that they perform the target task for
extrinsic (intrinsic) reasons, i.e. the overjustiﬁcation (insufﬁcient justiﬁcation) effect
(Staw, 1976). When extrinsic rewards are very explicit and salient, then people may
change
task from play
(intrinsically-motivated task) to work (extrinsically-motivated activity) (Tang and
Baumeister, 1984). The notion of “play” is associated with a choice of activity,
self-determined goals and strategies, opportunities to readjust goals, whereas the term
“work” is related to performance standards, strategies, and external feedback from
supervisors. People working for money may become the pawns (slaves) of money
rather than the origins (masters) of money (cf. deCharms, 1976).

the

On the basis of the discrepancy notion of satisfaction (Lawler, 1971), people may
experience a high level of dissatisfaction when they have high expectations toward
money. Apathetic money managers who have low extrinsic reward expectations have
the highest intrinsic job satisfaction, whereas careless money admirers who have high
extrinsic (money) expectations have the lowest intrinsic job satisfaction (Luna-Arocas


Money proﬁles

607

and Tang, 2004). Extrinsic reward may undermine intrinsic motivation (Deci and
Ryan, 1985). Achieving money worshipers have the highest income and money
repellent individuals have the lowest.

The protestant work ethic. The principal aspects of the PWE are hard work,
asceticism, and industriousness (Weber, 1958). People with high PWE endorsement
spend more time on a task, produce greater output, and work longer hours on their
study and less time on leisure than those without (Furnham, 1990). Achieving money
worshipers have the highest PWE endorsement, while money repellent individuals
have the lowest (Luna-Arocas and Tang, 2004). We will use Blood’s (1969) scale, one of
the most popular measures, in this study. Intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction and
PWE have been examined by Luna-Arocas and Tang (2004). We now turn to several
new variables for our money proﬁles in this study.

Organization-based self-esteem. OBSE can be deﬁned as “the degree to which
organizational members believe that they can satisfy their needs by participating in
roles within the context of an organization” (Pierce et al., 1989, p. 625). OBSE reﬂects an
evaluation of one’s sense of personal adequacy and worthiness as an organizational
member. Employees with high OBSE have come to believe that they are important,
meaningful, effectual, and worthwhile within their employing organization. As such, it
is the self-perceived value that employees have of themselves within their employing
organization, and those with high OBSE have come to believe (based upon successful
experiences) that they can satisfy their needs by participating in roles within the
context of the organization (McAllister and Bigley, 2002; Pierce et al., 1993; Tang and
Gilbert, 1994; Tang and Ibrahim, 1998a). High OBSE employees tend to be better
organizational citizens and have high global self-esteem (Tang and Ibrahim, 1998a).
Importance and satisfaction of human needs. Based on induction from his own
clinical observations, Maslow postulated a hierarchy of human needs incorporating
ﬁve levels: physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, self-esteem needs, and
self-actualization needs. Later, Maslow (1968) suggested the biologically based
two-level hierarchy: deﬁciency motivation and growth motivation. Maslow’s theory
remains very popular among managers and students of organizational behavior
because it provides an attractive and intuitively acceptable perspective to human
motivation and has a common-sense appeal to managers in our society today.

In this study, we will use a different version of the LOMS (Tang, 1992) and expect to
ﬁnd the same money proﬁles among university students: achieving money worshipers
will have the most positive attitudes toward money. Money repellent individuals will
have the strongest belief that money is evil. Careless money admirers will have general
positive attitudes toward money but they do not budget their money carefully. Finally,
apathetic money managers are indifferent toward money.

Regional state university students in the USA do have part-time jobs but do not
have a lot of money. The largest clusters for Macedonian students are money repellent
individual (53.6 percent) and apathetic money manager (32.1 percent) (Tang et al., n.d.).
For Chinese students, the largest cluster is apathetic money manager (31.50 percent)
(Du and Tang, 2003). Based on these two studies, we expect to have a large apathetic
money manager cluster in this student sample. We suspect that the percentage of
people in each of these clusters may be different for different samples.

Money repellent individuals have the most negative attitudes toward money, the
lowest income, lowest work ethic, and lowest satisfaction with pay administration

(Luna-Arocas and Tang, 2004). “Organizational care is a fundamental contextual
source of OBSE” (McAllister and Bigley, 2002, p. 900). Following these suggestions, we
predict that money repellent Individuals will have the lowest scores on OBSE, the
PWE, and intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction, whereas achieving money
worshipers will have the highest. Actual pay level is consistently and positively
related to pay satisfaction. Students with low income will have lower satisfaction of
needs. Before graduating from the university and getting a full-time job, there is little
or no hope (i.e. low importance) for signiﬁcant increase of income and satisfaction of
needs. Money repellent
individuals are less optimistic than achieving money
worshipers. We predict that money repellent individuals will have the lowest scores for
the importance and the satisfaction of human needs, whereas achieving money
worshipers will have the highest. In this study, we will examine the importance and
satisfaction of human needs using a modiﬁed measure of Porter’s (1961) need
satisfaction questionnaire (NSQ) (Tang and Ibrahim, 1998b; Tang et al., 2002a).

H1. Money repellent individuals will have the lowest scores on OBSE, the PWE,
and intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction, whereas achieving money
worshipers will have the highest.

H2. Money repellent individuals will have the lowest concerns for the importance
and satisfaction of human needs, whereas achieving money worshipers will
have the highest.

Methods
Participants
We distributed a 200-item questionnaire to students in two regional state universities
and in a military base in the Southeastern USA and collected data from 564 students
ðmale ¼ 184; female ¼ 360; missingdata ¼ 20Þ: The return rate was 72.9 percent.
They participated in the study voluntarily and their conﬁdentiality was assured. These
students had an average age of 23.52 years and had 14.64 years of education. There
were 441 Caucasian, 52 African-American, 6 Hispanic, 14 Asian, and 3 American
Indian. Further, 91 subjects were married, 406 were single, and 16 were divorced.
Moreover, 363 participants (64.4 percent of the sample) reported having 26.14 months
ðSD ¼ 64:55Þ of work experience on the job and an average annual
income of
US $9,260.94 ðSD ¼ $10; 522:68Þ: In a 2001 survey of students in one of
the
universities, 89 percent of them were working (37 percent had one job, 44 percent had
two jobs, and 3 percent had 3 or more jobs).

Measures
We measured demographic variables: gender, age, education, total work experience (in
month), marital status, and income. A ﬁve-point Likert-scale with disagree strongly (1),
neutral
(3), and agree strongly (5) as anchors was employed for all attitudinal
measures.

The love of money scale. The LOMS has been used in many countries and in many
languages, such as Chinese, French, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Russian, and others
(Luna-Arocas and Tang, 2004). We used the 30-item-6-factor LOMS (MES, Tang, 1992).


Money proﬁles

609

The Cronbach’s alphas are listed below: factors good (0.83), evil (0.73), achievement
(0.75), respect (0.75), budget (0.78), and power (0.74).
Other measures. We measured OBSE using a ten-item scale (Pierce et al., 1989)
ða¼ 0:92Þ: The 20-item Minnesota satisfaction questionnaire was employed to assess
intrinsic ða¼ 0:86Þ and extrinsic (0.84) job satisfaction (Weiss et al., 1967). We applied
the 13-item modiﬁed Porter’s (1961) NSQ (Tang and Ibrahim, 1998b; Tang et al., 2002a,
b). The number of items and Cronbach’s alpha for the importance and satisfaction of
Maslow’s ﬁve needs are listed below: physiological needs (three items, importance ¼
0:87; satisfaction ¼ 0:83), safety needs (three items, 0.82, 0.73), social needs (two items,
0.73, 0.65), self-esteem needs (two items, 0.55, 0.67), and self-actualization (three items,
0.84, 0.82) respectively. Finally, the four-item PWE developed by Blood (1969) was
employed (a¼ 0:70 in this study).

The ultimate goal of the cluster analysis is to arrive at clusters of people who
display small within-cluster variation, but large between-cluster variation. In this
study, we will follow the three-stage procedure:

(1) partitioning;
(2)
(3) validation and proﬁling (Luna-Arocas and Tang, 2004).

interpretation; and

Results
Partitioning
Table I shows the mean, standard deviation, and correlation of major variables. We
applied the QUICK CLUSTER program to the whole sample. We closely examined the
results of two-, three-, four-, and ﬁve-cluster solutions and identiﬁed a four-cluster
solution that ﬁtted our data and theory:

(1) money-repellent individual (15.54 percent);
(2) apathetic money manager (31.08 percent);
(3) careless money admirer (30.16 percent); and
(4) achieving money worshiper (23.22 percent).

The means and standard deviations of the ﬁve factors of the LOMS for the four clusters
are presented in Table II. These four clusters were arranged from the most negative
attitudes toward money to the most positive.

In the present study, the order for these four clusters (in size) is not exactly the same
as the four clusters identiﬁed in previous studies (Du and Tang, 2003; Luna-Arocas and
Tang, 2004; Tang et al., n.d.). These differences were probably related to the
participants’ work-related experiences, income, the socialization process, and different
cultures. Students in the USA can be classiﬁed into four clusters, again, based on a
different measure of the LOMS (Tang, 1992).

Interpretation
The F tests should be used only for descriptive purposes because the clusters have
been chosen to maximize the differences among cases in different clusters. Results of
analyses of variance (ANOVAs) suggested that factor good was the most powerful
money attitude in proﬁling the participants ðFð3; 543Þ ¼ 377:97; p ¼ 0:001Þ; followed
by factors respect ðFð3; 543Þ ¼ 168:10; p ¼ 0:001Þ; achievement ðFð3; 543Þ ¼ 162:08;

Notes: * p , 0:05; Scheffe’s test. For each factor (row) of the LOMS, the highest and the lowest means
are in boldface. The lowest means are italicized

p ¼ 0:001Þ; power ðFð3; 543Þ ¼ 161:14; p ¼ 0:001Þ; budget ðFð3; 543Þ ¼ 37:45; p ¼
0:001Þ; and evil ðFð3; 543Þ ¼ 6:02; p ¼ 0:001Þ (Table III).

The importance of these six factors of the LOMS in the present study is different
from that of the previous studies (Luna-Arocas and Tang, 2004; Tang et al., n.d.). The
last column of Table III presents the a posteriori contrasts of means using the most
conservative method, the Scheffe’s test ð p , 0:05Þ: The mean differences among the
four money clusters discussed below:

(1) Money-repellent individual. People in Cluster 1 (the smallest cluster) had the
highest score for factor evil and also the lowest scores for factors good and
power. They also tended to have low scores for factors achievement and budget.
The most signiﬁcant factor is that they consider money as evil, the strongest
negative affect toward money.

(2) Apathetic money manager. This cluster (the largest one) had the lowest scores
for factors respect and achievement and the highest score for factor budget.
They also tended to have low score for factor evil and moderate scores for
factors good and power. In general, apathetic money managers have negative
attitudes toward money (respect and achievement), do budget their money
carefully, and think that money is moderately evil. In other words, they are
indifferent (apathetic) toward money. Results reﬂect the mindset of students.
Students do not have a lot of money. Therefore, it is not very likely for them to
feel that money is a sign of their achievement and that money gives them the
respect they deserve. However, attending school and working on part-time jobs
help them understand the importance of money. For the little money they have,
they budget and use it very carefully and skillfully.

had the highest scores for factors good, respect, achievement, and power. They
also tended to have high scores regarding factors budget and evil. These people
had the most positive attitudes toward money.

Validation and proﬁling
ANOVA. For external validation, we used separate analyses of variance (ANOVAs)
and the Scheffe’s test for the aposteriori contrasts of means and also discriminant
analysis. Variables examined in this section were not used in cluster analysis and
ANOVAs reported earlier (Table III).

There were no signiﬁcant differences in age, education, job tenure and annual
income among the four money clusters. Although the differences failed to reach
signiﬁcance, achieving money worshipers (Cluster 4) had slightly more income than
others. The results are in the expected direction. For professors in the USA and Spain,

Individuals tended to express the lowest concerns and satisfaction of most of these
needs. There were no differences regarding the importance of social needs and the
satisfaction of self-esteem needs among the four money proﬁles. These results support
the notion that those who express positive attitudes toward money tend to show
positive attitudes toward themselves as employees in an organization (OBSE), the
intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction, and also
work-related attitudes (PWE),
satisfaction of human needs in general
(physiological, safety, social, and
self-actualization). Results support H1 and H2.

Discriminant analysis. We included age, sex, education, good, evil, achievement,
respect, budget, power, OBSE, PWE, intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction, and the
importance and satisfaction of ﬁve human needs (i.e. physiological, safety, social,
self-esteem, and self-actualization) to predict the membership of the four clusters (a
nominal scale). Job tenure and income were not included in this analysis because
including these two variables may reduce the sample size signiﬁcantly.

Table IV shows that Function 1 separated Cluster 1 from Cluster 4. Achieving
money worshipers (Cluster 4) tended to have positive attitudes toward money (money
is good) than money repellent individuals (Cluster 1). Further, Function 2 separated
Cluster 1 from Cluster 2. Money repellent individuals were different from careless
money handlers in factors good, respect, and achievement. Finally, Function 3
separated Cluster 3 from Clusters 1 and 4. Careless money admirers (Cluster 3) tended
to be different from others in factors budget and evil. Further, 91.57 percent of original
grouped cases correctly classiﬁed. The variables employed in the discriminant
analysis are very powerful in predicting the membership of these four money proﬁles.

Discussion
We identiﬁed four money proﬁles that are similar to those reported in previous studies
(Du and Tang, 2003; Luna-Arocas and Tang, 2004; Tang et al., n.d.):

(1) money-repellent individual (15.54 percent);
(2) apathetic money manager (31.08 percent);
(3) careless money admirer (30.16 percent); and
(4) achieving money worshiper (23.22 percent).

The percentage of people in different money proﬁles reveal the extent to which people
are motivated by money in this sample. The percentage of people in each of these four
proﬁles and the order of importance for these six factors in classifying people into
money proﬁles in the present study are different from that of the other three studies.
These differences are due to the different versions and factors of the LOMS and the
different types of participants from different cultures. The results of the present study
further support the external validity of the LOMS and the four money proﬁles.

Achieving money worshipers consider money in the most positive direction and
have the highest scores for factors good, respect, achievement, and power, a sign of
their success. They are concerned about how they budget their money (the behavioral
component of the LOMS) and have the highest level of OBSE, PWE, intrinsic and

extrinsic job satisfaction, and satisfaction with social and self-actualization needs (i.e.
higher-order needs). Their satisfaction of physiological and safety needs is also very
high. It is possible that those who worship money may actually achieve what they
want (money) and are quite happy with what they have ﬁnancially. Achieving money
worshipers have been identiﬁed as the largest group among university professors in
the USA and Spain (Luna-Arocas and Tang, 2004) and business owners in Macedonia
(Tang et al., n.d.). It is the third largest group in the present sample.

Careless money admirers have general positive feelings toward money but they do
not Budget their money carefully. They tend to have a moderate level of OBSE, PWE,
and intrinsic satisfaction and a moderately high level of satisfaction with safety needs
and social needs. The behavioral aspect of the LOMS (i.e. factor budget) seems to play
an important role in several aspects of satisfaction in life. If individuals budget their
money carefully, they tend to have higher work satisfaction and life satisfaction (Tang,
1992). They try very hard to make money. It is plausible that people in this cluster can
be highly motivated by money.

Apathetic money managers believe that money does not represent

their
achievement and respect but they do budget their money carefully. This is the
largest group in the present sample. All participants are university students who do
not have a lot of money, do not believe that money is a sign of their achievement and
respect, and do budget their money (no matter how little) carefully. On the basis of the
discrepancy notion of satisfaction (Lawler, 1971), people may experience a high level of
dissatisfaction when they have high expectations toward money. With low income,
they turn their attention internally and ﬁnd fulﬁllment in life and on the job. Our
results reveal that they have the highest level of satisfaction with their physiological
needs and safety needs (lower-order needs). As mentioned earlier, achieving money
worshipers have the highest level of satisfaction with social and self-actualization
needs (higher-order needs). Apathetic money managers’ low desire for money may lead
to higher satisfaction in different aspects of their lives, supporting the insufﬁcient
justiﬁcation effect (Staw, 1976). Apathetic money managers are poor but happy. Their
basic needs are satisﬁed. Money will only help them survive and have a reasonable life.
To them, money is only a hygiene factor, not a motivator. They may be highly
motivated by money when they work longer and are older.

Money repellent individuals have the most negative attitudes toward money and
believe that money is evil. Money repellent idividuals have the lowest level of OBSE,
the PWE, intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction, importance of needs (physiological,
safety, self-esteem, and self-actualization needs) and satisfaction of needs
(physiological, safety, social, and self-actualization needs). They may be labeled as
the “sour grapes”. Young and low-income people tend to believe that money is evil
(Tang, 1992).

In recent years, some Americans are living on less by scaling back, paring down,
and doing without. The “simplicity movement” has its roots in eighteenth century
“Yankee frugality” and in Henry David Thoreau’s urge to “simplify, simplify”. In a
simple, less stressful, and enviously uncluttered life, people can live on far less by
curbing impulse spending and doing the things that matter to them. Our apathetic
money managers seem to have adopted these values. This is the largest cluster in this
study. In general, students tend to have negative attitudes toward money, whereas
employees have positive attitudes. It is possible that as students graduate from college,

616

they start to work for their money, spend their money, and enjoy having money. Their
direct experiences with money may change their money attitudes. High-income people
tend to think that money is not evil (Tang, 1992). As people grow older, their income
level changes. The importance and satisfaction of needs in life and their money
attitudes may also change (Furnham and Argyle, 1998; Tang et al., 2002a, b).

It takes time for people to progress from deﬁciency needs (physiological needs) to
growth needs (psychological needs). People in the 45-49, or the 50-54 age groups
(Katkowski and Medsker, 2001) reach the highest median income of their career. In the
present study, there are no signiﬁcant differences in students’ age among the four
money proﬁles (the average age ¼ 23.52). We speculate that some of these students (e.g.
money repellent individuals) may become achieving money worshipers when they
become a member of the 45-49 or the 50-54 age groups. Still others may not change at
all. It has been found that among the four money proﬁles, people in the achieving money
worshiper cluster were the oldest (46.49 years), had the highest income ($50,903.23), and
the longest work experience (21.55 years) (Luna-Arocas and Tang, 2004).

In summary, American students with different money proﬁles have certain patterns
income, and contextual
of work-related attitudes, needs, demographic variables,
variables. Research may help managers understand, predict, and control behaviors in
organizations. Results may help managers identify the best strategies to manage
part-time employees and students. Future researchers may examine the following
issues directly: do people (in any proﬁle) change their money attitudes over time?
When, how, where does the change happen? How much income does it take to change
one’s money attitude? Does
satisfaction-progression and
frustration-regression processes, like the needs hierarchy model? More research in
this direction is needed.
