Introduction

Based on institutional theory, this study investigates the effects of three institutional pressures on top
managers’ posture towards reverse logistics implementation: government, customer, and competitor
pressures. Survey data from 209 manufacturers of Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China reveal that
institutional pressures have a statistically signiﬁcant positive inﬂuence on top managers’ posture
towards reverse logistics implementation. In addition, while top managers’ posture is strongly related
to product recovery, it is not related to product return. We also ﬁnd that product recovery has a
signiﬁcant positive effect on a ﬁrm’s economic and environmental performance. Conversely, the results
suggest that product return negatively affects a ﬁrm’s economic performance and has no effect on
environmental performance. We highlight the managerial implications.

The remarkable progress in industrialization and economic
development in the last two hundred years has accelerated the
global interchange of people, goods, and information to such an
extent that the natural environmental has been placed under a
tremendous burden, exceeding its capacity for self-recovery. In
recent years, the global warming issue has received a great deal of
attention from both public and private organizations. The 2009
Copenhagen Climate Change Summit highlights the importance of
energy-saving, emissions reduction, and low-carbon economy in
global economic development. More than ever, consumers, busi-
ness enterprises, and governments are paying increasing atten-
tion to sustainable development.

Under this situation, reverse logistics, which refers to the series
of activities necessary to retrieve a returned, used or damaged
product from the point of consumption to either dispose of it or
recover economic and/or environmental value (Thierry et al., 1995;
Rogers and Tibben-Lembke, 1999; Guide and Van Wassenhove,
2002; Prahinski and Kocabasoglu, 2006) has been viewed as an
effective way to improve resource productivity, reduce the negative
impact to environment, and improve both business performance
and environmental performance enabling ﬁrms to achieve compe-
titive advantage (Marien, 1998; Meyer, 1999; Stock et al., 2002; El
korchi and Millet, 2011). The advantages of reverse logistics are

twofold. First, ﬁrms are able to reduce their material and energy
resource consumptions and thus reduce operating costs. Second,
ﬁrms are able to generate revenue from returned, reconditioned or
recycled products and materials that were previously discarded
(Stock et al., 2002). A closed-loop supply chain with an effective
reverse logistics network can help to solve the growing concern
regarding environmental problems (Liste and Dekker, 2005; Salema
et al., 2007; Neto et al., 2009; Cruz-Rivera and Ertel, 2009). General
Motors, Estee Lauder, Sears and IBM have gained a sizeable
advantage over competitors through their implementation of a
well-managed reverse logistics system (Meyer, 1999; Stock et al.,
2002).

Reverse logistics is not yet a discipline that has attracted
sufﬁcient attention in China. Each year, the losses due to returns,
excessive production and recalls of defective product have grown
at an alarming rate (Lyles et al., 2008; Roth et al., 2008). As the
‘‘world’s factory’’, Chinese manufacturers play a key role in the
global supply chain and make great contributions to the devel-
opment of global economics. At the same time, however, China is
also one of the most polluted regions of the world. In addition,
Chinese manufacturers are experiencing intense resource con-
straints and are required to comply with an increasing number of
environmental regulations. These factors make the implementa-
tion of reverse logistics an enticing prospect for Chinese manu-
facturers, particularly those located in the most developed
regions.

Previous studies have identiﬁed a variety of antecedents to a
ﬁrm’s involvement with reverse logistics, mostly using case
studies and anecdotal information. Relatively little research has

examined large scale empirical data (Drumwright, 1994; Carter
and Ellram, 1998; A´ lvarez-Gil et al., 2007). In this study, through
the lens of institutional theory, we provide further insights into
why manufacturers engage in reverse logistics implementation.
Institutional theory proposes that an organization can improve its
abilities to grow and survive in a competitive environment by
satisfying its various stakeholders (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983).
Many studies recognized the importance of institutional theory to
explain ﬁrm-level behaviors (Scott, 1995; Handelman and Arnold,
1999; McFarland et al., 2008), and some also used it to explain the
behaviors of individuals within ﬁrms (Chatterjee et al., 2002).

Relying on institutional theory, this study assumes organiza-
tional decisions are based on the social structure in which the
ﬁrm operates—both external and internal to the ﬁrm. Given
China’s predominantly centralized power and hierarchical culture
(Lyles et al., 2008), the individual preferences of top managers are
likely to mediate and buffer these organizational and interorga-
nizational inﬂuences (Chatterjee et al., 2002; Aragon-Correa et al.,
2004). It is only whether top managers realize the importance of
reverse logistics that they will add it to the strategic agenda and
invest resources in its implementation (Kocabasoglu et al., 2007).
Thus, we test whether top mangers’ posture, which refers to top
managers’ attitude towards reverse logistics implementation, is a
mediator in the relationship between institutional pressures –
government, customer and competitor pressures – and reverse
logistics implementation.

Although many studies have implied that reverse logistics
implementation affects both economic and environmental per-
formance (Rogers and Tibben-Lembke, 2001; Autry et al., 2001;
Minahan, 1998; Trebilcock, 2002), large-scale research that has
examined the impact of reverse logistics implementation on ﬁrm
performance has found mixed results (Daugherty et al., 2001;
Prahinski and Kocabasoglu, 2006; Bernon et al., 2011). Thus, the
second objective of this study is to explore the effect of reverse
logistics implementation on ﬁrm performance—both economic
and environmental.

The paper is organized as follows. The literature is reviewed
and the hypotheses are developed in Section 2. The research
methodology and data analyses are described in Section 3. Section
4 discusses the empirical results and managerial implications.
Concluding remarks and suggestions for further research are
presented in Section 5.

2. Theoretical background and research hypotheses

In this section, we review the extant literature and develop our
hypotheses with a view to achieving the research objectives
outlined above. Fig. 1 graphically illustrates our proposed theore-
tical model, which captures institutional pressures, top managers’
posture, reverse logistics implementation and performance.

other organizations’’. Since managers’ decisions and interactions
take place within a social network that is affected by stakeholders, a
theoretical perspective that accounts for the impact of the social
climate, rather than simply the economic, rational perspective alone,
is more encompassing and may better explain organizations’ beha-
viors (Scott, 1995).

Stakeholders have an inﬂuence on top managers’ decisions to
implement reverse logistics (Carter and Ellram, 1998; Henriques
and Sadorsky, 1999; Zhu and Sarkis, 2007). In aligning relevant
stakeholders with institutional theory, we rely upon DiMaggio
and Powell (1983), who determined three predominant sources of
institutional pressures on decision maker: coercive pressure
(from government regulations), normative pressure (from custo-
mers) and mimetic pressure (from competitors).

2.1.1. Coercive pressure

Coercive institutional isomorphism stems from pressure exerted
on a dependent ﬁrm by other organizations and by cultural
expectations in the society in which it operates (DiMaggio and
Powell, 1983). Although government regulation can be an impetus
for innovative environmental practices (Murphy and Gouldson,
2000), managers typically interpret it as the most obvious external
coercive pressure to organizations’ environmental initiatives (Zhu
and Sarkis, 2007). Organizations should comply with these environ-
mental regulations, otherwise they will face the threat of govern-
ment levying legal actions, penalties, or even worst, removal from
the market (Sarkis et al., 2010).

Regulations are generally considered to be the greatest source of
external inﬂuence on a ﬁrm’s reverse logistics activities (Stock,
1992; Carter and Ellram, 1998; Lewis and Harvey, 2001;
Daugherty et al., 2002; Lai and Wong, 2012; Das and Chowdhury,
2012). The Supply Chain Consortium’s 2008 Hot Topic Survey Report,
Initiatives: Different Shades of Green reveals that
Environmental
adapting to regulation and reducing risk is the most important
motivating factor for companies to ‘‘go green’’ (http://supplychain
consortium.com/). Laws and regulations are viewed as the ‘‘civil
foundation’’ of ‘‘the virtue matrix,’’ which promotes social and
environmental responsibility conduct (Martin, 2002). Government
ofﬁcials in many parts of the world are paying close attention to
environmental protection and sustainable development. Many gov-
ernmental agencies have implemented standards and regulations
that encourage resource reuse, which can be enhanced through
reverse logistics (Kumar and Putnam, 2008). These laws and
regulations exert coercive institutional pressures on manufacturers
to implement reverse logistics, and may have a profound impact on
the attitudes and behaviors of top management (Murphy et al.,
1995). Therefore, we hypothesize that:

Hypothesis 1. Government regulations on environmental protection
have a positive inﬂuence on top managers’ posture towards reverse
logistics implementation.

2.1.

Institutional pressures

2.1.2. Normative pressure

Institutional theory is based on the premise that individuals and
organizational structures become institutionalized through the for-
mation of established, orderly, stable, and socially integrating
patterns that add value, or constraints, to the ﬁrm’s structure
or activities (Scott, 2003). Aldrich (1979, p. 265) argued that
‘‘The major factors that organizations must take into account are

Normative pressure stems from professionalism, typically
associated with the norms of formal education and professional
societies (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). As a form of social
legitimacy (McFarland et al., 2008), each ﬁrm is subject to the
norms, standards, and expectations of its external stakeholders
(Lai et al., 2006). Customers’ requirements form a core normative
pressure (Hall, 2000; Zhu and Sarkis, 2007) and are cited as an

important driving force in the implementation of reverse logistics
and other environmental
initiatives (Bansal and Roth, 2000;
A´ lvarez-Gil et al., 2007). Customer pressure comes from both
end consumers and downstream supply chain partners (Lewis
and Harvey, 2001).

Reverse logistics has been viewed as a normal operation in many
industries, such as newspapers, electronic products, pharmaceuticals
(Padmanabhan and Png, 1995; Petersen and Kumar, 2009). For
example, many manufacturers encourage their retailers to order
more products through return policy to mitigate retailer’s risk and
increase potential sales, especially for products with short life cycle,
which will subsequently lead to higher level of customer attitudinal
loyalty (Padmanabhan and Png, 1995; Morgan and Hunt, 1994). In
recent years, Chinese customers have increasingly come to expect
their manufacturing suppliers to offer this type of return policy. In
turn, these increased product return expectations have placed
normative pressures for Chinese manufacturers to implement
reverse logistics.

At the same time, as the level of environmental consciousness
across society has risen, consumers and downstream supply chain
partners have developed a preference for green and environmen-
tal products (Lewis and Harvey, 2001). The reverse logistics
process can not only help to reduce the volume of emissions
and pollutants released, but can also extend product and material
lives through the adoption of a recovery process (Bloemhof-
Ruwaard et al., 1995; Thierry et al., 1995). Thus, implementing
environmental practices, including reverse logistics practices, can
enhance relationships with consumers and supply chain partners
(Stock et al., 2002). Based on this discussion, we propose the
following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2. Customer pressure has a positive inﬂuence on top
managers’ posture towards reverse logistics implementation.

2.1.3. Mimetic pressure

Organizations and individuals are embedded in social
networks (McFarland et al., 2008). Firms and individuals in these
networks are inclined to imitate the behaviors of other network
members (Henisz and Delios, 2001). Firms may not only imitate
organizations they perceive as successful in their industry, but
also imitate organizations with which they have social ties
(Galaskiewicz and Wasserman, 1989).

Effective reverse logistics management has become an impor-
tant point of difference and an opportunity to build competitive
advantage (Stock et al., 2006; Genchev, 2009), especially as more
companies have high-quality products, good customer service
and other competitive advantages (Stock, 1998). For example,
manufacturers that offer an effective return policy mitigate
retailers’ risk and thus increase their sales due to retailers’
willingness to maintain higher inventory levels (Padmanabhan
and Png, 1995). If a key competitor has implemented reverse
logistics to attract consumers and gain comparative competitive
advantages, other companies will also implement reverse logistics
(Narver and Slater, 1990). Companies should pay attention to
changes in competitors’ environmental marketing strategies
(Lewis and Harvey, 2001). As multinational companies’ (MNCs)
invest in China, Chinese ﬁrms faced with new foreign competition
are under increasing pressure to implement environmental
protection practices, including reverse logistics practices. Hence,
we hypothesize that:

Hypothesis 3. The adoption of reverse logistics by competitors has a
positive inﬂuence on top managers’ posture towards reverse logistics
implementation.

2.2. Top managers’ posture

Many research studies have emphasized that top management
plays a key role in establishing an organization’s norms and
expectations (Chatterjee et al., 2002). Top managers’ posture is
positively related to the scope and speed of the environmental
activities (Bansal, 2003). Some ﬁrms reactively implement reverse
logistics to comply with laws and regulations (Daugherty et al.,
2002) or meet customer demands (Lewis and Harvey, 2001), while
others proactively attempt to develop a strategic and competitive
advantage (Marien, 1998). These different approaches suggest that
top managers’ posture may play an important role in decisions on
reverse logistics implementation (A´ lvarez-Gil et al., 2007). Top
managers’ initiative is one of the driving forces behind companies
initially implementing environmental programmes
(Lau and
Ragothaman, 1997; Epstein and Roy, 1998). Top management
support is also necessary to ensure the continuing success of reverse
logistics programs (Carter and Ellram, 1998).

Since reverse logistics is very different

from traditional
forward supply chain logistics, additional resources are needed
to facilitate an efﬁcient operation (Richey et al., 2005). For a
reverse logistics initiative to be successful, it is essential that top
managers have a supportive attitude and are committed to
implementing the initiative, particularly when it comes to obtain-
ing the ﬁnancial and staff resources required to support structural
and infrastructural change. Such commitment is vital to ensuring
the success of environmental strategy and programs over time
(Sarkis et al., 2010). Top managers’ posture is particularly relevant
in China, given its pervasive hierarchical structures and high
power distance culture, whereby power in a ﬁrm is distributed
unequally (Lyles et al., 2008) and top managers play a signiﬁcant
role in decision making (Chatterjee et al., 2002).

2.3. Reverse logistics

The literature offers many alternative deﬁnitions of reverse
logistics.
In general, these deﬁnitions are structured in two
different manners. First, reverse logistics describes the transpor-
tation, warehousing, and inventory management activities
involved with the reverse supply chain process whereby efforts
are made to recover value from any product or material that a
customer returns to a supply chain network (Kopicki et al., 1993;
Stock, 1998). This supply chain network may or may not be the
same as the forward supply chain that initially delivered the
product to the customer. Second, reverse logistics has been
deﬁned more broadly to include all processes associated with
the reverse supply chain, including those referred to in the ﬁrst
deﬁnition along with the collection, disassembly, reassembly,
distribution, and sale of recycled materials or reconditioned
products (Rogers and Tibben-Lembke, 2001; Daugherty et al.,
2001; Gonza´ lez-Torre et al., 2004). In some prior studies, reverse
logistics includes the waste stream (Thierry et al., 1995; Guide
and Van Wassenhove, 2002; Prahinski and Kocabasoglu, 2006).

According to Chinese standardized logistics terms (GB/T18354-
2001 established by the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision, 2001), reverse logistics encompasses two concepts:
product return and product recovery. Product return refers to the
physical distribution of used or defective goods from the point of
consumption to the point of origin for the purpose of remanufactur-
ing,
recovery refers to
the transformation of used or defective goods in an effort to
recover value by repairing, reconditioning, remanufacturing and/or
recycling them.

reusing or destroying them. Product

The deﬁnition of reverse logistics adopted in this study most
closely resembles the broad deﬁnition given above; we deﬁne
reverse logistics as a series of activities necessary to retrieve a

135

product from the point of consumption to either dispose of it or
recover economic and environmental value. Similar to the deﬁni-
tion used by the Chinese government, we consider reverse
logistics to be composed of product return and product recovery.
In the Kocabasoglu et al. (2007) study, top manager’s risk
propensity towards involvement with the reverse supply chain
was directly related to the reconditioning process, an aspect of
product recovery. Although we were unable to ﬁnd any studies
that link top manager’s posture to activities associated with
product return, anecdotal evidence suggest that manager’s atti-
tude is instrumental to the success of a product return imple-
mentation (Padmanabhan and Png, 1995). Therefore, we
hypothesize that:

Hypothesis 4. There is a direct positive relationship between top
managers’ posture toward reverse logistics and the implementation
of product return.

Hypothesis 5. There is a direct positive relationship between top
managers’ posture toward reverse logistics and the implementation
of product recovery.

2.4. Performance

Previous studies have shown that a well-managed reverse
logistics program reduces costs, increases revenue and improves
customer service and satisfaction levels (Stock et al., 2002; Rogers
and Tibben-Lembke, 1999). In addition, by implementing such a
program, a ﬁrm gains intangible beneﬁts associated with an
improved corporate image, corporate social legitimacy and compe-
titive advantages (Stock et al., 2002; Toffel, 2003; Wong et al., 2012).
In this study, we examine two forms of performance:
economic and environmental. Economic performance is asso-
ciated with the ﬁnancial impact of the ﬁrm’s reverse logistics
process (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996). Environmental perfor-
mance measures reﬂect the social and environmental beneﬁts of a
reverse logistics program, such as reduced environmental pollu-
tion, legislative compliance and the development of a corporate
image as a socially responsible enterprise (Daugherty et al., 2001).

2.4.1. The relationship between product return and performance

implementing and maintaining a product

There is no agreement on whether product return is positively
related to performance. Some researchers believe that product
return is a necessary evil since it forces manufacturers to spend
additional costs, including production, logistics and depreciation
costs (Padmanabhan and Png, 1995; Petersen and Kumar, 2009).
Moreover,
return
system requires strategic planning and the investment of additional
resources in facilities, training and operating activities; it can be
viewed as a costly sideshow (Stock et al., 2002). It has been reported
that the values of product return exceeds an estimated $100 billion
annually and average approximately 6% of sales for US manufac-
turers and retailers (Stock and Mulki, 2009). Thus, product return
tends to be treated as a necessary evil of a ﬁrm (Petersen and
Kumar, 2009).

Although product returns increase costs associated with addi-
tional processes and reverse logistics, it can also be beneﬁcial
since it may reduce customers’ purchase risk and increase their
repurchase behaviors (Petersen and Kumar, 2009). Hence, some
researchers argue that a well-managed product return system
generates revenue in excess of the costs incurred (Stock, 1998).
First, by establishing ﬂexible return policies, manufacturers can
increase sales by encouraging retailers to order more products
and mitigate retailers’ risk simultaneously. Without a product
return policy, retailers may order conservatively to mitigate
thus limiting the manufacturer’s total sales
inventory risk,

(Padmanabhan and Png, 1995). Second, by recalling defective
products and proactively preventing potential hazards from aris-
ing, organizations can enhance their relationships with consu-
mers and supply chain partners (Stock et al., 2002), thus enabling
them to be perceived as socially responsible (Chen et al., 2009).
Better customer service will lead to higher levels of customer
satisfaction and customer loyalty, which will in turn result in
enhanced future purchase intentions (Chen et al., 2009) and
increased revenues. In addition, since ‘‘each product has its own
life cycle, and each return may require different treatment,
depending on whether the product is defective, damaged, recycl-
able or repackageable’’ (Meyer, 1999, p. 28), manufacturers are
most knowledgeable about how to recycle parts and reduce
environmental pollution through the return of used and defective
products. Therefore, we hypothesize that:

Hypothesis 6. There is a direct positive relationship between
product return and the ﬁrm’s economic performance.

Hypothesis 7. There is a direct positive relationship between
product return and the ﬁrm’s environmental performance.

2.4.2. The relationship between product recovery and performance
The product recovery process – which may include repairing,
reconditioning, remanufacturing or recycling – should be seen as
an opportunity to obtain a competitive advantage (Stock et al.,
2002). Product recovery has the potential to improve proﬁtability
by reducing raw materials costs, compliance and liability costs,
gaining access to new customers and increasing revenues
(De Brito et al., 2002; Prahinski and Kocabasoglu, 2006). For
example, Nike encourages its consumers to return their used
shoes, which it then shreds and processes to make basketballs for
the less fortunate (Rogers and Tibben-Lembke, 1999). Automotive
battery returns reduce waste and production costs and enhance
customer satisfaction (Marien, 1998). Some companies even
realize higher margins on their remanufactured products than
they do on their original products (Stock et al., 2002).

When industries implement a product recovery process, the
environmental impact is improved by reusing materials, cutting
energy use and reducing the need to send products to landﬁll
(Guide et al., 2000). Yet empirical research supporting this
relationship is sparse. Prahinski et al. (2009) found that when
ﬁrms invest in reconditioning products, the amount of toxic
emissions released by their plants falls. Not only do such
proactive activities help organizations cut waste and environ-
mental pollution, but they appear to reduce operating costs and
increase customer loyalty. Based on our review of the literature,
we hypothesize that:

Hypothesis 8. There is a direct positive relationship between
product recovery and the ﬁrm’s economic performance.

Hypothesis 9. There is a direct positive relationship between
product recovery and the ﬁrm’s environmental performance.

2.5. Control variable

To eliminate potential confounds, we included a control
variable which may inﬂuence the relationships between key
variables in the model. Firm size can account for differences in
an organization’s behavior and has long been considered an
important general control variable to examine a range of organi-
zational issues (Hannan and Freeman, 1984). Large ﬁrms may
have greater ﬁnancial and managerial resources than small ﬁrms
for the implementation of environmental practices (Wagner et al.,
2012). We use ﬁrm size, as measured by the number of employ-
ees, to serve as an exogenous control factor.

3.1. Questionnaire development

The questionnaire we used for this study included four
sections: institutional pressures, top managers’ posture, reverse
logistics implementation and performance. The construct mea-
surements can be found in the Appendix. Content validity was
supported by a review of the literature, managerial interviews
and a pre-test. Based on the feedback and insights gained, slight
modiﬁcations were made to clarify meaning and to tailor pre-
viously tested items to Chinese management practices. Twenty-
nine items were used to measure the eight constructs. Based on
institutional theory categorizations, seven items were used to
measure three kinds of institutional pressures (A´ lvarez-Gil et al.,
2007; Lewis and Harvey, 2001; Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999;
Zhu et al., 2005)—two for government pressure, two for customer
pressure and three for competitor pressure. Four items captured
top managers’ attitude towards reverse logistics implementation
(Chatterjee et al., 2002; Daugherty et al., 2005; A´ lvarez-Gil et al.,
2007). The two reverse logistics constructs, product return and
product recovery, were each measured on the basis of three items
according to the deﬁnition of Chinese standardized logistics terms
(see Section 2.3) and prior literature (A´ lvarez-Gil et al., 2007;
Skinner et al., 2008). The economic and environmental perfor-
mance constructs were captured by 12 items (Daugherty et al.,
2005; Zhu et al., 2005).

3.2. Sampling and data collection

To obtain a representative sample, we randomly selected
manufacturing plants from the China Telecom yellow pages for
Pearl River Delta. The Pearl River Delta (PRD), an area composed
of nine major cities in Guangdong province, represents more than
10% of China’s GDP, 30% of all foreign investments in China, and is
the top global producer of electronics products (http://www.
gdstats.gov.cn/tjnj/c20.htm). We phoned the selected companies
to determine the most appropriate respondents – CEOs/presi-
dents, vice presidents of operations managements, or supply
chain managers – and to conﬁrm their contact information. The
questionnaires were mailed to these key respondents with a cover
letter highlighting the study’s objectives. Follow-up calls were
made to improve the response rate. From the 1000 mailed

questionnaires, 642 responses were received, of which 33
responses contained incomplete information. Therefore, the effec-
tive response rate was 60.9% (N¼609). Because not all businesses
are actively involved in reverse logistics, those that had not
implemented four or more of the six reverse logistics activities,
as reﬂected in questions R1 through R6 in Appendix A.3., were
eliminated. A total of 209 questionnaires were available to be
used for this study. Descriptive statistics for the respondent
companies are given in Table 1.

3.3. Common method variance assessment

To test the problem of common method bias, Harmon’s single
factor approach was adopted. According to this approach, a single
factor will emerge from the factor analysis of all survey items or a
general factor will account for most of the common variance if
common method bias exists (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). The un-
rotated exploratory factor analysis with all survey items reﬂected
seven distinct factors with the eigenvalue-greater-than-one criterion
and accounted for 68.48% of the total variance. The ﬁrst factor
captures 31.19% of the variance, which suggests an absence of the
common method bias. Moreover, we used conﬁrmatory factor
analysis to further test for common method bias. A model positing
that a single factor underlies the variables was assessed by linking

3.4. Factor analysis

An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to determine
the main constructs measured by the items. Factors were extracted
using principal components analysis and varimax rotation. Kaiser
normalization (eigenvalues41) was used to clarify the factors. The
results of the EFA for each construct are shown in Tables 2–5. An
analysis of the factor loadings for institutional pressures indicates
that the ﬁrst factor captures the respondents’ general perceptions of
government pressure, which includes government regulations on
environmental protection along with subsidy and tax policies. The
second factor gauges the respondents’ perceptions of customer
pressure and the third represents competitor pressure. These three
factors explain 75.32% of the inherent variation in institutional
pressures. Top managers’ posture emerged as one factor with a
large positive eigenvalue and accounts for 71.63% of the inherent
variation. Two distinct dimensions, product return and product
recovery, were identiﬁed for reverse logistics implementation and
explain 65.67% of the variation in reverse logistics implementation.
The two performance factors, economic performance and environ-
mental performance, explained 67.78% of the variation. As shown by
the results in Tables 2–5, the reliability of these factors is supported.
All Cronbach’s alpha values are above the lower limit of 0.60 to
ensure the internal consistency and validity of a construct (Nunnally
and Bernstein, 1994).

3.5. Construct validity

A conﬁrmation factor analysis (CFA) model using the AMOS
7.0 was estimated to assess convergent and discriminant validity.
In the model, each item is linked to its corresponding construct
with freely estimated covariance. The model ﬁt indices are
w2 ¼ 571:73 with df¼349, CFI¼0.931, NNFI¼0.932, IFI¼0.932,
RMSEA¼0.055, and RMR¼0.041, which suggest that the model is

acceptable (Hu et al., 1992). Generally, a construct with loadings
of items over 0.5, or a signiﬁcant t-value (t42.0), or both, is
considered to have convergent validity (Fornell and Larcker,
1981; Chau, 1997). Furthermore, a construct is considered to
have convergent validity if the eigenvalue exceeds 1.0 in an EFA
(Hair et al., 1998). In our model, all factor loadings are greater
than 0.5 and the t-values are all greater than 2.0, as shown in
Table 6. All eigenvalues are greater than 1.0, again supporting the
convergent validity of our model. The statistical power of the
is sufﬁciently high and close to 1.00 with df¼365
model
(MacCallum et al., 1996). To assess the discriminant validity, we
compared the square roots of the average variance extracted
(AVE) for each construct with the correlations of any two
constructs. The square roots of AVEs are larger than the correla-
tions between all pairs of constructs in the model, as is shown in
Table 7, indicating a satisfactory level of discriminant validity
(Fornell and Larcker, 1981).

3.6. The structural model

A structural equation model with maximum likelihood esti-
mation was used to test all relationships between latent variables
and observed variables, and the relationships among multiple
latent variables, simultaneously. The goodness of ﬁt indices were
w2 ¼ 711:45 with df¼388, CFI¼0.900, NNFI¼0.902, IFI¼0.900,
RMSEA¼0.063, and RMR¼0.071, all of which are better than the
threshold values suggested by Hu et al. (1992). Therefore, the
model is deemed acceptable and no modiﬁcations were made.
The structural equation model and the standardized coefﬁcients
of each path are reﬂected in Fig. 3.

Europe, have introduced regulations associated with returning
defective goods, recycling packaging materials and handling waste
materials. Although the Chinese government has established
environmental protection legislation and exerted pressure on
Chinese manufacturers to implement reverse logistics and related
environmental protection activities, enforcement of these regula-
tions remains weak. At a meeting with more than 1000 leading
Wal-Mart suppliers, Chinese ofﬁcials and non-government organi-
zations held in Beijing on October 20, 2008, Mike Duke, the current
CEO of Wal-Mart, stated ‘‘China’s commitment to environmental
sustainability is clear, and the laws on the books reﬂect that.
Where improvement is needed is in the area of compliance’’
(http://walmartstores.com/Video/?id=1158). One of
the most
important issues facing the Chinese government is determining
how these regulations can be adequately enforced. Without enfor-
cement, top managers may take advantage of legal loopholes and
resist implementing reverse logistics.

Paying attention to the customer has always been a critical
aspect of business. By suggesting that customer pressure has a
statistically signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on top managers’ posture
towards the implementation of reverse logistics, our results
extend the traditional view that the customer is always right by
highlighting the key role consumers play in inﬂuencing manage-
rial views on what should be done with returned, used, or
damaged products; simple replacement is not enough. As reverse
logistics becomes a more common practice, Chinese companies
would implement product return and product recovery policies to
meet normative requirements within their respective industries.
Increasingly, Chinese manufacturers face the wrath of consumers
or downstream supply chain partners who boycott products that
do not meet their standards. Customers are thus likely to exert
strong pressure via multiple channels on Chinese companies to
become actively involved with reverse logistics. The moderate
level of statistical signiﬁcance (po0.10) may be related with
Chinese consumers. Due to the relative low income levels and
living standard in China, Chinese consumers may not accept the
high price for environmentally–friendly products. In addition,
their awareness and education associated with consuming
environmentally–friendly products still needs to be improved
when compared with consumers in developed countries.

Finally, competitive practices appear to put pressure on
Chinese ﬁrms to implement reverse logistics. As reverse logistics
management becomes standard practice, and thus an order
qualiﬁer, Chinese ﬁrms will support and maintain these compe-
titive practices. In addition, as more multinational companies
establish manufacturing bases in China, they will exert pressure
on their upstream Chinese suppliers to improve environmental
performance. Competitive pressure and rising expectations
spurred by the widespread adoption of return and recovery
policies will put pressure on top managers to become involved
with reverse logistics practices. However, compared to the tradi-
forward supply chain, additional resources must be
tional

Institutional pressures and top managers’ posture

Each of the three institutional pressures – government, custo-
mer and competitor – has a statistically signiﬁcant and positive
relationship with top managers’ posture towards reverse logistics
implementation (po0.10). Hypotheses 1–3 are supported at the
10% signiﬁcance level.

The results suggest that government regulations are aligned
with top managers’ posture to implement reverse logistics. Many

invested (Kocabasoglu et al., 2007). Therefore, economic pressure
may restrain top managers’ reverse logistics implementation even
though competitors have gained competitive advantage with it.

In addition, other important factors may inﬂuence the imple-
mentation of reverse logistics besides these three institutional
pressures. For instance, Carter and Ellram (1998) reviewed
previous studies on reverse logistics and summarized that both
internal (company factors) and external factors (customers, sup-
pliers, competitors and government agencies) inﬂuenced the
reverse logistics program. Rogers and Tibben-Lembke (2001)
suggested that the importance of reverse logistics relative to
other issues, such as company policies, lack of systems, compe-
titive issues, management inattention, ﬁnancial resources, per-
sonnel resources and legal issues, affected reverse logistics.

4.2. Top managers’ posture and reverse logistics implementation

Interestingly, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant positive relationship
between top managers’ posture and product recovery (po0.01),
while we do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship between top
managers’ posture and product return (p40.10). There are
several possible explanations for the non-signiﬁcant result. First,
due to the Chinese culture of ‘‘saving face’’, Chinese managers are
less willing to admit that they have made mistakes. As returns or
recalls of unsatisfactory or defective products require that man-
agers admit that their companies have made errors or mistakes
(Meyer, 1999), top managers in China are likely to be less willing
to do so than their foreign counterparts. Furthermore, top
managers are reluctant to implement a product return system
because they believe that returns and recalls will damage the
ﬁrm’s reputation and lead to revenue and market-share losses
(Chen et al., 2009). In addition, many Chinese environmental
protection regulations are related to the mandatory implementa-
tion of product recovery processes to reduce emissions and
pollution; in contrast, the recall system in China remains in a
nascent stage (Zhao et al., 2012). It seems that mandatory recalls
of defective products, particularly food and drugs, have occurred
only after serious incidents have come to light. Therefore, without
government legislation to pressure ﬁrms to recall products, it is
unlikely that top Chinese managers will take proactive steps to
implement product recall practices (Zhao et al., 2012).

A second possible explanation for the non-signiﬁcant result is
that managing product returns can be complicated (Meyer, 1999).
Considerable time, effort and cost are expended to establish a
well-managed product return system. Extra work, such as

determining appropriate product handling and disposal protocols,
arranging transportation, and redesigning the supply chain net-
work to handle return ﬂows, is needed (Richey et al., 2005).
Furthermore, due to the millions of small suppliers that provide
bulk ingredients and the difﬁculty in tracing all stages of produc-
tion, processing and distribution, China’s traceability system is ill-
equipped to facilitate product returns (Roth et al., 2008; Wang
et al., 2009). Thus, top Chinese managers are unwilling to
implement a product return system and do not believe that doing
so is justiﬁed from a cost–beneﬁt perspective.

In contrast, however, top managers in China are proactively
implementing product recovery systems. One of the reasons for
this is regulatory pressure. If companies do not satisfy minimum
environmental protection requirements (e.g., emission and pollu-
tion standards), the repercussions could be signiﬁcant, such
as large ﬁnes and the possibility of operations being discontinued.
A second reason is that by reusing materials and thereby gaining
access to new customers and markets, reducing costs and increas-
ing revenue, ﬁrms can potentially enhance their proﬁtability
(Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996). Thus, top Chinese managers ﬁnd
the idea of implementing product recovery systems acceptable.

The control variable, ﬁrm size measured as the number of
employees, did not have a signiﬁcant association with product
return or product recovery practices.

4.3. Reverse logistics implementation and performance

In this study, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant relationships between
product recovery and both economic and environmental perfor-
mance (po0.01). Hypotheses 8 and 9 are supported. Product
recovery is clearly a high-value opportunity. Our results are
consistent with those reported by Kocabasoglu et al. (2007),
who suggested that re-use, reconditioning, remanufacturing and
refurbishing are high-value recovery opportunities. Due to the
stringent Chinese regulations on the circular economy and sus-
tainable development, top managers are implementing product
recovery programs to manage the recycling and reuse of waste
materials. These initiatives are not simply responses to govern-
ment mandates, customer pressure and competitive isomorphism;
the organizations enhance economic performance by reducing
operating costs and increasing revenue and market share.
In
addition, organizations that implement such initiatives have a
positive inﬂuence on their environment by reducing both the
amount of waste generated and their reliance on virgin materials.

F. Ye et al. / Int. J. Production Economics 143 (2013) 132–143

Chinese managers are clearly aware of the economic and environ-
mental value of product recovery.

lower costs,

In contrast to our hypothesis, the path coefﬁcient relating
product return and economic performance is signiﬁcant and
negative (po0.01). In addition, product return is not signiﬁcantly
related to environmental performance (p40.10). Thus, Hypotheses
6 and 7 are not supported. Chinese managers view product return
as a costly initiative with little or no environmental
impact.
Product return is viewed by most companies as a ‘‘necessary evil’’
(Dutton, 2010) and a painful process (Stock et al., 2006). A ﬁrm can
only increase revenues,
improve proﬁtability and
enhance customer service level from effective product return
strategies and well-managed programs (Stock et al., 2006); other-
wise, the companies would not realize the beneﬁts (Stock and
Mulki, 2009; Das and Chowdhury, 2012). Thus, product return
could be an additional cost incurred in a company’s normal
business practices (Stock, 2004). Chinese managers may delay the
implementation of a product return system until the opportunity
to generate revenue can be afﬁrmed. In addition, many Chinese
manufacturers have not yet established strong supply chain
integration and collaborative arrangements. Thus, the foundations
of a product return system that is workable for manufacturers in
the Pearl River Delta may not yet exist or be well managed. A well-
managed reverse logistics system can generate customer loyalty
and product feedback, whereas a poorly managed one will sig-
niﬁcantly increase costs and slow the ﬁrm’s responsiveness
(Kocabasoglu et al., 2007).

5. Conclusions

This study investigates the antecedents and outcomes of reverse
logistics implementation through a large-scale study. We explore
the antecedents of reverse logistics implementation from the
perspective of institutional theory. Speciﬁcally, we propose that
top mangers’ posture is the mediator of the relationship between
institutional pressures – government, customer and competitor –
and reverse logistics implementation. In addition, we examine the
relationship between reverse logistics implementation and the
ﬁrm’s economic and environmental performance.

The empirical results suggest that the government, customers
and competitors have statistically signiﬁcant positive inﬂuences
on top managers’ posture towards reverse logistics implementa-
tion. However, top managers’ posture appears to affect only
product recovery practices, and does not appear to have a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on product returns. We ﬁnd that product
recovery has a signiﬁcant positive impact on both economic and
environmental performance, but that product return has a nega-
tive impact on the ﬁrm’s economic performance and no effect on
the ﬁrm’s environmental performance.

regulations emphasize product

The lack of signiﬁcant results in our testing of the hypotheses
associated with product returns leads to several
interesting
insights. First, it is possible that Chinese managers are not willing
to establish a product return system due to the Chinese culture of
saving face and a propensity to avoid admitting to errors. Second,
government
recovery, while
neglecting opportunities associated with product returns. Third,
China’s product traceability system is at a nascent stage and is
complicated by the large number of small suppliers. Fourth, the
considerable time, money and effort required to establishing and
maintaining a complex product return system that relies on
supply chain collaboration and cooperation is a signiﬁcant barrier.
These factors may explain why top Chinese managers have not
emphasized product return and why the existing product return
system is poorly managed, has a negative effect on economic
performance, and has no effect on environmental performance.

The different model results between product recovery and product
return suggest that managers view reverse logistics as a complex
phenomenon; it is not one overarching system. Kocabasoglu et al.
(2007) found that investments in reconditioning is distinctly different
from investments in recycling and waste management, concluding
that ‘‘the results suggest that companies have yet to perceive the
oforward supply chain4 investment and reconditioning as inter-
dependent and to address the challenges of integrating these invest-
ments’’ (p. 1156). Similar to Kocabasoglu et al. (2007), we found that
companies have not integrated product returns and product recovery,
which would enable effective use of resources. Frequently, ﬁrms in
the reverse supply chain manage product returns distinctly different
from product recovery.

This study provides several contributions to the existing litera-
ture on reverse logistics. First, this study empirically examines the
antecedents of the implementation of reverse logistics through the
lens of
institutional theory. Second, this study examines top
mangers’ posture as the mediator of the relationship between
institutional pressures and reverse logistics implementation, thereby
helping to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the
antecedents of reverse logistics implementation. Furthermore, by
empirically testing a large-scale design, this study reinforces the
existing evidence of factors that inﬂuence reverse logistics imple-
mentation by adding to the conceptualized models and anecdotal
evidence presented in prior studies. Based on managerial responses
from enterprises in the Pearl River Delta, this study provides a
Chinese perspective of reverse logistics.

In addition, this study provides interesting implications for
both policy-makers and practitioners. First, policy-makers need to
increase the education and publicity associated with recycling
economics, cultivating entrepreneurs’ social responsibility, and
enhancing consumers’ awareness of environmental
friendly
product consumption. These changes would enhance top man-
agers’ posture to adopt environmental practices and consumption
of environmentally friendly products. Second, when policy-
makers provide environmentally–friendly regulations,
they
encourage environmental practices; the enforcement of these
environmental regulations should be strengthened. Finally, to
enhance legislative initiatives regarding environmental practices,
policy-makers should incorporate environmental-related indices
into the top mangers’ performance evaluation system, especially
for large Chinese state-owned enterprises and heavy pollution
industries.

The mind-set of practitioners is critical to the success of
reverse logistics systems. In today’s global economy, practitioners
must move beyond the interpretation that government regulation
burdens practitioners with reverse logistics. The well-managed
reverse logistics system is conducive to achieve the double
bottom line of environmental and ﬁnancial performance. Second,
managers believe that the poorly managed reverse logistics will
damage a ﬁrm’s bottom line. To successfully operate a reverse
logistics program, top managers should borrow the best practices
on reverse logistics. IBM, Xerox, and Estee Lauder successfully
incorporated reverse logistics into the ﬁrm’s strategic agenda and
invested the necessary resources. In conclusion, top managers
should keep a close eye on trends and changes of governmental
regulation, customers and competitors, so as to adjust the related
environmental strategy quickly.

The main limitation of this study is that we collected data
solely from the Pearl River Delta. Although the Pearl River Delta is
one of the most important regions in China from an economic
perspective, and is the most important electronics products
manufacturing base in the world, it is not representative of China
as a whole. Since China is a large country with uneven economic
development across regions (Zhao et al., 2006), our results cannot
be generalized for the nation. Studies based on samples drawn

141

from other regions, such as the Yangtze River Delta, the Bohai Sea
economic area and the southwest, would provide for a degree of
geographic and economic diversity and extend the generalizabil-
ity of our results. A second limitation of our study is that it is
based on cross-sectional data. A longitudinal study would enable
us to draw causative implications associated with the effect of
reverse logistics on economic and environmental performance.

There are a number of worthy directions for future research.
For example, since resources are needed to implement efﬁcient
reverse logistics systems, it would be interesting to examine the
moderating effects of different types of resource investments such
as technological, ﬁnancial and managerial resources on reverse
logistics implementation and performance. A comparative study
on the differences in reverse logistics implementation across
distinct industries and forms of ownership would provide further
results that complement our ﬁndings.
