ABSTRACT. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a model
that investigates the selected antecedents and consequences of work-
family conf lict and family-work conf lict in frontline service jobs. Data
were obtained from a sample of full-time frontline employees in
Northern Cyprus hotels as its setting. The results of the path analysis
showed that negative affectivity (NA) amplified employees’ work-family
conflict and family-work conflict. Work-family conflict was found to be
a significant outcome of work overload, whereas family-work conf lict

INTRODUCTION

In today’s intense competitive pressures, sophisticated and dis-
cerning customers demand the highest level of service quality
(Yasin and Yavas 1999). Frontline employees represent a critical
link between the hotel organization and its customers and are
the main actors in the provision of exceptional service quality.
Frontline employees, however, are confronted with a number of
problems such as inconvenient work schedules, work overloads,
insufficient pay, and low training (Deery and Shaw 1999: Karatepe
and Tekinkus 2006: Zohar 1994). In addition, frontline employees
often have difficulty arranging time and effort between work and
family roles. Apparently, they experience conflicts between work
(family) and family (work) domains (Karatepe and Sokmen 2006;
Netemeyer, Brashear-Alejandro, and Boles 2004).

There are two types of conflicts in the work-family interface that
have been identified in the extant literature: work-family conflict
and family-work conflict (Gutek, Searle, and Klepa 1991). Work-
family conflict stems from job demands that interfere with perform-
ance of the family role, and family-work conflict stems from home
and family demands that interfere with performance of the work

role (Netemeyer, Boles, and McMurrian 1996). Empirical research
indicates that work-family conflict and=or family-work conflict have
adverse effects on frontline employees’ psychological (e.g., job satis-
faction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions) and
behavioral (e.g., job performance) consequences (Karatepe and Kilic
2007; Netemeyer et al. 2004).

Against this background, the current study develops and tests a
model that examines the selected antecedents and consequences of
work-family conflict and family-work conflict. Specifically, negative
affectivity (NA) and work overload are the antecedents of two direc-
tions of conflict between work and family roles. The consequences of
work-family conflict and family-work conflict are creative perform-
ance, career satisfaction, and turnover intentions. The relationships
among the antecedents and outcomes of work-family conflict and
family-work conflict are also examined. The abovementioned rela-
tionships are tested using data obtained from frontline employees
in Northern Cyprus hotels.

The current study, which investigates these relationships among
frontline hotel employees, is relevant and significant. Specifically,
there is still a dearth of empirical research regarding the effects
of work-family conf lict and family-work conflict on frontline
employee outcomes (Karatepe and Kilic 2007; Netemeyer et al.
2004). There is also a need for more empirical research about
the issues of work-family conf lict and family-work conflict in
developing countries, since the empirical findings we rely on are
derived mainly from the samples of the studies that have been con-
ducted in developed Western or affluent countries (Karatepe and
Baddar 2006; Poelmans, O’Driscoll, and Beham 2005). Conse-
quently, the results of this study may present useful suggestions
about how managers should develop and implement strategies in
order to ameliorate frontline employees’ work-family and family-
work conflicts.

The paper is organized as follows. First, the conceptual model,
which consists of the selected antecedents and outcomes of work-
family conflict and family-work conflict, is presented. Second, the
research hypotheses based on the theoretical underpinnings of the
model are given. Third, the methodology of the study is described
and the empirical findings are presented. Finally, the paper con-
cludes with the implications of the findings and avenues for future
research.

CONCEPTUAL MODEL AND
RESEARCH HYPOTHESES

that

Figure 1 illustrates the conceptual model

includes the
relationships to be tested in the present study. Specifically, NA and
work overload are treated as the antecedents of work-family conflict
and family-work conflict. Creative performance, career satisfaction,
and turnover intentions are treated as the consequences of two direc-
tions of conflict between work and family roles. As depicted in Figure
1, NA exacerbates work overload. In the model work overload
reduces creative performance and career satisfaction. The model
demonstrates that creative performance is posited to enhance career
satisfaction. The model also shows that higher career satisfaction
leads to lower turnover intentions.

Antecedents of Work-Family Conflict and
Family-Work Conflict

As a dispositional personality variable, NA is an individual’s tend-
ency to experience discomfort across time and situations (Watson and
Clark 1984). Individuals high in NA are likely to be ‘‘anxious, afraid,
and angry’’, whereas those low in NA ‘‘report feeling placid, calm, and

FIGURE 1. Conceptual Model

contented’’
(Cropanzano, James, and Konovsky 1993, p. 596).
Watson, Pennebaker, and Folger (1987) discuss that NA is a con-
founding variable and should be controlled in job stress research.
Likewise, Brief et al. (1988) argue that NA should be controlled
in such studies as a confounding variable. In contrast, Chen and
Spector (1991) have found that NA does not explain much of the vari-
ance shared by stressors and job satisfaction, anger, and feelings of
stress and frustration. Moyle (1995) has reported that NA is an
important dimension to be included in job stress research but also
has noted that it has a complex role, rather than a confounding role.
Spector, Zapf, Chen, and Frese (2000) discuss that NA may play
different substantive roles in job stress research and therefore should
not be incorporated automatically into these studies as a confounding
or nuisance variable.

Although limited, there is evidence that NA amplifies work-family
conflict and family-work conflict. For example, Stoeva, Chiu, and
Greenhaus (2002) reported that NA was significantly and positively
related to both work-family and family-work conflicts for a sample
of senior civil servants in Hong Kong. Bruck and Allen (2003) also
showed that NA increased employees’ work-family and family-work
conflicts.

Accordingly, the following hypotheses are proposed:

H1: NA is positively related to frontline employees’ (a) work-
family conflict and (b) family-work conflict.

In this study work overload is defined as ‘‘the perceived magnitude
of work-role demands, and the feeling that there are too many things
to do and not enough time to do them’’ (Parasuraman, Purohit,
Godshalk, and Beutell 1996, p. 280). As depicted in Figure 1, work
overload increases work-family conflict. The Conservation of
Resources (COR) theory provides a framework for understanding
the relationship between the two constructs. According to the theory,
individuals seek to obtain, retain, protect, and foster resources
(objects, personal characteristics, conditions, and energies) and stress
is a reaction to the environment where there is a threat of loss of
resources, an actual loss of resources, or a lack of resource gain
following the investment of resources (Hobfoll 1989, p. 516). As
discussed by Harvey, Kelloway, and Duncan-Leiper (2003), work
complaints among
overload has become one of

the major

employees. Additionally, role conflict, role ambiguity, and stressful
events are among the major work demands (Lee and Ashforth
1996; Wright and Cropanzano 1998). Not surprisingly, these major
demands and complaints are also prevalent in frontline service jobs
in the hotel industry (Cannon 1998; Karatepe and Sokmen 2006;
Ross 2005). According to the COR theory, having work overload
might drain available resources and leave fewer resources to the
family domain (cf. Grandey and Cropanzano 1999). In this case,
work overload leads to conflict between work and family domains.
There is empirical evidence in the relevant literature that work
overload is significantly and positively associated with conflicts
between work (family) and family (work) domains. For instance,
Aryee, Luk, and Lo (1999) reported that work overload triggered
work-family and family-work conflicts for a sample of employed par-
ents in Hong Kong. Recently, Aryee, Srinivas, and Tan (2005) found
similar results for a sample of employed parents in India. Using a
sample of employees of an accounting firm, Harvey et al. (2003) also
demonstrated that there was a strong positive relationship between
work overload and work-family conflict.

Based on the above discussion and findings, the following hypoth-

eses are proposed:

H2: Work overload is positively related to frontline employees’ (a)
work-family conflict and (b) family-work conflict.

Consequences of Work-Family Conflict and
Family-Work Conflict

Figure 1 illustrates that creative performance is treated as one of
the consequences of work-family conflict and family-work conflict.
According to Amabile (1983, p. 358), ‘‘creativity is best conceptua-
lized not as a personality trait or a general ability but as a behavior
resulting from particular constellations of personal characteristics,
cognitive abilities, and social environments.’’ Consistent with this
conceptualization and the definition given by Wang and Netemeyer
(2004, p. 806), in this study creative performance is conceptualized
as the amount of new ideas generated and novel behaviors exhibited
by frontline hotel employees in performing their job activities. In
frontline service jobs in the hotel industry, creativity is evidenced

when employees generate and assess new solutions for customer
complaints, evaluate old problems from a different perspective, or
define a neglected problem and offer various solutions (cf. Wang
and Netemeyer 2004). In addition, as discussed by Alge, Ballinger,
Tangirala, and Oakley (2006), organizations may create and sustain
a competitive advantage through employees who display creative
performance in the workplace.

There are empirical studies regarding the effects of conflicts in the
work-family interface on frontline employees’ job performance and
service recovery performance in the relevant literature (Karatepe
and Sokmen 2006; Netemeyer et al. 2004). To the best of authors’
knowledge, however, the relationships of two directions of conflict
between work and family roles with frontline employees’ creative per-
formance in the hotel industry in a developing economy have not
been empirically investigated before. The COR theory provides a
basis for these relationships. Specifically, frontline employees who
lose their resources in the process of juggling both work and family
roles may not be able to focus on the generation of new ideas or can-
not generate and evaluate new ideas for the effective resolution of
customer complaints. Under these circumstances, they may display
lower creative performance in the workplace.

Hence, the following hypotheses are proposed:

H3a: Work-family conflict
employees’ creative performance.
H3b: Family-work conflict
employees’ creative performance.

is negatively related to frontline

is negatively related to frontline

According to the relationships demonstrated in Figure 1, both
work-family conflict and family-work conflict reduce career satisfac-
tion. Career satisfaction refers to ‘‘. . . personal satisfaction with vari-
ous aspects of career progress and success . . .’’ (Parasuraman et al.
1996, p. 283). High levels of conflicts in the work-family interface
experienced by frontline employees lead to career dissatisfaction. As
the COR theory posits, individuals experience a sense of discomfort
and are dissatisfied with their career, since they lose certain resources
(e.g., time, knowledge) while juggling both work and family roles.

Despite this recognition, there are limited studies in the extant
literature concerning the effects of work-family conflict and family-
work conflict on career satisfaction. Besides, there are anomalous

findings across various individual studies. Specifically, Parasuraman
et al. (1996) reported that family-work conflict lessened entrepreneurs’
career satisfaction. Their study, however, failed to provide support
for the relationship between work-family conf lict and career
satisfaction. Neither did Aryee and Luk’s (1996) study find a sig-
nificant relationship between the two constructs for a sample of
dual-earner couples in Hong Kong. On the other hand, Martins,
Eddleston, and Veiga (2002) demonstrated that work-family con-
f lict was significantly and negatively associated with managers’
career satisfaction.

In short, employees in frontline service positions lose certain
resources to be able to cope with a number of problems emanating
from both work-family and family-work conflicts. As a result of
resource loss, they display dissatisfaction with their career. This
prompts the following hypotheses:

H4a: Work-family conflict
employees’ career satisfaction.
H4b: Family-work conflict
employees’ career satisfaction.

As the COR theory suggests, individuals may think of leaving their
current organization, once they find that they are no longer capable
of coping with problems arising from conflicts between work (family)
and family (work) domains (Karatepe and Kilic 2007). Thus, they
may have an opportunity to eliminate the drainage of their resources
by displaying turnover intentions (Grandey and Cropanzano 1999).
There is evidence that both work-family and family-work conflicts
result in turnover intentions. For example, Haar (2004) found that
two directions of conflict between work and family roles increased
government employees’ turnover intentions in New Zealand. Karatepe
and Sokmen (2006) reported that conflicts in the work-family interface
amplified frontline employees’ intention to leave the organization in
the Turkish hotel industry. Karatepe and Baddar (2006) also found
similar results in the Jordanian hotel industry.

Accordingly, the following hypotheses are proposed:

H5a: Work-family conflict
employees’ turnover intentions.
H5b: Family-work conflict
employees’ turnover intentions.

Other Relationships

Figure 1 shows the relationship of NA with work overload.
Individuals high in NA are likely to perceive their work overload in
a generally more negative way. Empirical evidence reveals that NA
heightens hospital employees’ perceptions of work overload (Iverson,
Olekalns, and Erwin 1998).

Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:

H6: NA is positively related to frontline employees’ work overload.

The COR theory suggests that ‘‘. . . excessive demands and=or insuf-
ficient resources within a particular role domain or between domains
can result in negative affective and dysfunctional behaviors.’’ (Shaffer,
Harrison, Gilley, and Luk 2001, p. 100). Due to heavy workloads,
employees cannot concentrate on the creation of new ideas or app-
roaches for the resolution of various problems. Thus, this study posits
that work overload has a detrimental effect on frontline employees’ cre-
ative performance. As such, having work overload is likely to make
employees become dissatisfied with their career.

On the basis of the above discussion, we propose the following

hypotheses:

H7: Work overload is negatively related to frontline employees’ (a)
creative performance and (b) career satisfaction.

As demonstrated in the conceptual model, creative performance
is linked to career satisfaction. Frontline service jobs requiring a
variety of skills appear to satisfy employees in the workplace (cf.
Wang and Netemeyer 2004). Hence, frontline service jobs that
allow and encourage employees to display creative performance
are likely to enhance satisfaction with their career. The model also
indicates that higher career satisfaction results in lower turnover
intentions. Specifically, frontline employees who are satisfied with
their career do not intend to leave their organization. There is evi-
dence to support that career satisfaction is significantly and nega-
tively related to turnover intentions. For instance, Igbaria and
Siegel (1992) indicated that information systems personnel who
were dissatisfied with their overall career exhibited higher turnover
intentions.

In light of the above discussion and empirical evidence, the follow-

ing hypotheses are proposed:

H8: Creative performance is positively related to frontline employ-
ees’ career satisfaction.
H9: Career satisfaction is negatively related to frontline employees’
turnover intentions.

METHODOLOGY

Sample

Data were collected from a judgmental sample of full-time front-
line employees in four-star and five-star hotels of Northern Cyprus.
As single childless employees often have family and social commit-
ments to their parents, siblings, or relatives, this study did not limit
the sample to married employees with or without children. This
approach is consistent with those of Grzywacz and Marks (2000)
and Karatepe and Kilic (2007).

Northern Cyprus is a small island destination in the Mediterranean
region. Hotels in Northern Cyprus are highly dependent on Turkish
tourists and thus suffer from low occupancy rates (Altinay and
Bowen 2006). Most of the hotels in the research location are indepen-
dently=family-owned and -operated businesses. Frontline employees
in such hotels are confronted with many problems such as role stress,
low pay, inadequate training, work-family conflict, unsocial work
hours, and excessive job demands (Karatepe and Kilic 2007).

According to the Statistical Yearbook of Tourism (2005), there
were 7 four-star hotels and 7 five-star hotels in the research location.
One of the members of the research team contacted the managements
of the abovementioned hotels prior to data collection. The research
team received permission from 3 four-star hotels and 6 five-star hotels
for data collection. A total number of 250 self-administered question-
naires were then distributed to frontline employees in these hotels. All
frontline hotel employees (e.g.,
food servers, beverage servers,
and front desk agents) had frequent face-to-face or voice-to-voice
interaction with customers and were responsible for dealing with
various customers’ needs and requests. Participants were assured of
anonymity and confidentiality of their responses. By the cut-off date

for data collection, a total number of 170 questionnaires were
retrieved, yielding a response rate of 68%. Such a high response rate
is also reported in prior research (Boles, Wood, and Johnson 2003).
Fifty-eight percent of the respondents were between the ages of
18–27, 29% between the ages of 28–37, and the rest were older than
37. Sixty-five percent of the respondents were male. Thirty percent
of the respondents had secondary and high school education, while
7% of the respondents had primary school education. Almost one-
third of the respondents had two-year college degrees, while 27% of
the respondents had four-year college degrees. The rest had graduate
degrees. Twenty-five percent of the respondents had tenures less
than 1 year, 48% tenures between 1 and 5 years, 17% tenures between
6 and 10 years, and the rest had tenures above 10 years. Seventy-one
percent of the respondents were single or divorced, while the rest were
married. Seventy-three percent of the respondents had no children.
Nineteen percent of the respondents had children between 1 and 2,
six percent had children between 3 and 4, and the rest had children
above 4.

Measurement

Multiple-item scales were taken from different sources in the relevant
literature in order to operationalize the study constructs shown in
Figure 1. Responses to the NA, work overload, work-family conflict,
family-work conflict, career satisfaction, and turnover intentions items
were elicited on five-point scales ranging from 5 (strongly agree) to 1
(strongly disagree). The creative performance items were rated on a
five-point scale ranging from 5 (almost always) to 1 (never). Higher
scores indicated higher NA, work-family conflict, family-work conflict,
creative performance, career satisfaction, and turnover intentions. After
the negatively worded items in work overload had been reverse scored,
high scores indicated higher work overload.

Negative Affectivity

NA was operationalized using three (3) items from Agho, Price,
and Mueller (1992). These three items were used in past empirical
research (Iverson et al. 1998). Sample items include ‘‘Minor setbacks
sometimes irritate me too much’’ and ‘‘Often I get irritated at little
annoyances’’.


12

SERVICES MARKETING QUARTERLY

Work Overload

Four items from Price (2001) were used in order to measure work
overload. Similar items were used in past research (Ko, Price, and
Mueller 1997). Items include ‘‘I have enough time to get everything
done in my job’’ and ‘‘My workload is not heavy on my job’’.
These two items were reverse-coded. The other two items include
‘‘I have to work very hard in my job’’, and ‘‘I have to work very
fast in my job’’.

Work-Family Conflict and Family-Work Conflict

Conflicts in the work-family interface were measured using items
from Boles, Howard, and Donofrio (2001) and Netemeyer et al.
(1996). Specifically, work-family conflict and family-work conflict
each consisted of five items. The abovementioned scale items were
widely used in the relevant literature (Mesmer-Magnus and Viswes-
varan 2005). Sample items for the work-family scale include ‘‘The
demands of my work interfere with home, family, and social life’’
and ‘‘Things I want to do at home do not get done because of the
demands my job puts on me’’. Sample items for the family-work
conflict scale include ‘‘Things I want to do at work do not get done
because of the demands of my family, spouse, or friends’’ and ‘‘My
home and social life interfere with my responsibilities at work such
as getting to work on time, accomplishing daily tasks, and working
overtime’’.

Creative Performance

Six items from Wang and Netemeyer (2004) were adapted to
measure frontline hotel employees’ creative performance. The cre-
ative performance scale is new and has been developed to measure
salespeople’s creative performance (Wang and Netemeyer 2004).
Items include ‘‘I carry out my routine tasks in ways that are
resourceful’’, ‘‘I come up with new ideas for satisfying customer
needs’’, ‘‘I generate and evaluate multiple alternatives for novel
customer problems’’, ‘‘I have fresh perspectives on old problems’’,
‘‘I improvise methods for solving a problem when an answer is
not apparent’’, and ‘‘I generate creative ideas for service delivery’’.


Karatepe, Kilic, and Isiksel

Career Satisfaction

Five items from Greenhaus, Parasuraman, and Wormley (1990) were
used to operationalize career satisfaction. These items were used in prior
research (Burke, Oberklaid, and Burgess 2005). Sample items include ‘‘I
am satisfied with the success I have achieved in my career’’ and ‘‘I am
satisfied with the progress I have made toward meeting my overall career
goals’’.

Turnover Intentions

Three items were taken from Singh, Verbeke, and Rhoads (1996)
to measure turnover intentions. The same items were used in
previous research (Karatepe and Baddar 2006). Sample items include
‘‘It is likely that I will actively look for a new job next year’’ and ‘‘I
often think about quitting’’.

Age, gender, education, organizational tenure, marital status, and
the number of children are statistically controlled in this study, since
they may significantly affect the study constructs and have confound-
ing effects on the relationships (e.g., Karatepe and Kilic 2007;
Mauno, Kinnunen, and Ruokolainen 2006; Stoeva et al. 2002). Age
and education were measured using five-point scales. Tenure was
measured using a six-point scale. The number of children was mea-
sured using a four-point scale. Gender was coded as a dichotomous
variable (0¼ male and 1¼ female). Marital status was also coded as
a dichotomous variable (0¼ single or divorced and 1¼ married).

The survey instrument was originally prepared in English and
then translated into Turkish using the back-translation method
(Parameswaran and Yaprak 1987). The instrument was tested with
a pilot sample of 32 frontline employees in two different hotels.
The results indicated that frontline employees had no difficulty
understanding the items in the questionnaire. Accordingly, no
changes were made in the questionnaire.

The measures were subjected to confirmatory factor analyses to
provide support for the issues of dimensionality, convergent and
discriminant validity. In addition, the measures were subjected
to Cronbach alpha analysis to provide support for the issue of
internal consistency. The hypothesized relationships were tested
using path analysis through LISREL 8.30 (Joreskog and Sorbom
1996).

According to the initial results of the confirmatory factor analysis,
the two work overload items, which were ‘‘I have to work very hard
in my job’’ and ‘‘I have to work very fast in my job’’, had non-
significant t-values. Therefore, these items were dropped during con-
firmatory factor analysis. The final results of the confirmatory factor
analysis demonstrated relatively a reasonable fit of the seven-factor
model
fit statistics
(v2¼ 536.69, df¼ 356; GFI [Goodness of Fit Index]¼ .82; NNFI
[Non-Normed Fit Index]¼ .88; CFI [Comparative Fit Index]¼ .90;
RMSEA [Root Mean Square Error of Approximation]¼ .055;
RMR [Root Mean Square Residual]¼ .07). The standardized loadings
ranged from .46 to .90. The overwhelming majority of the loadings were
above .60. All t-values ranging from 5.69 to 14.32 were significant.
Consequently, the magnitudes of the loadings and model fit statistics
provided evidence of convergent validity (Anderson and Gerbing 1988).
A series of pairwise confirmatory factor analyses were employed
to assess the issue of discriminant validity. In particular, a two-
dimensional model for each pair of study constructs was first
fit, and then items representing each factor were forced into a single
factor solution. Various fit statistics produced better results for a
two-factor model. The results strongly suggest that each set of items
represents a single underlying construct and provides evidence
of discriminant validity (Anderson and Gerbing 1988). Table 1
indicates that all reliability coefficients were above the commonly
accepted cut-off value of .70, excluding work overload whose
coefficient was .66.

Composite scores for each measure were computed by averaging
scores across items representing that measure. The correlations,
means, and standard deviations are presented in Table 1. The results
of the correlation analysis demonstrated that the overwhelming
majority of the control variables did not have any significant associa-
tions with the study constructs. The results revealed that age, gender,
education,
tenure, marital status, and the number of children
were significantly and positively associated with work-family conflict.
Specifically, older, better educated, and married frontline employees
and those with longer tenure and with more children reported

higher conflict between work and family domains. The findings also
showed that female frontline employees experienced greater work-
family conflict.

Test of Research Hypotheses

The correlation matrix in Table 1 was used as an input to LISREL
8.30 in order to test the hypotheses (Joreskog and Sorbom 1996).
The initial results demonstrated that none of the control variables
had significant effects on NA, work overload, creative performance,
career satisfaction, and turnover intentions, whereas several control
variables were significantly associated with work-family conflict
and family-work conflict. Thus, the model was retested by constrain-
ing the nonsignificant path coefficients of the control variables to ‘‘0’’
on model variables. Table 2 indicates that the model fits the data well
on the basis of a number of fit statistics (v2¼ 40.42 df¼ 25; p¼ .026;
GFI¼ .96; NNFI¼ .86; CFI¼ .94; RMSEA¼ .061; RMR¼ .055). Of
the fifteen hypotheses, nine were supported, whereas six were not.

According to the model test results, NA is significantly and posi-
tively associated with work-family and family-work conflicts. Thus,
there is empirical support for both H1(a) and H1(b). The results of
the path analysis indicate that work overload has a significant posi-
tive impact on work-family conflict, whereas family-work conflict
is not a significant outcome of work overload. Therefore, H2(a) is
supported, whereas H2(b) is not.

The linkages between conflicts in the work-family interface and
creative performance are not significant. Therefore, no empirical sup-
port exists for H3(a) and H3(b). The model test results reveal that the
path from work-family conflict to career satisfaction is significant
and negative. Hence, H4(a) is supported. In contrast, family-work
conflict exerts no significant negative effect on career satisfaction.
Thus, H4(b) is not supported. According to the results in Table 2,
family-work conflict significantly and positively influences turnover
intentions, whereas work-family conflict does not. Therefore, H5(b)
is supported, whereas H5(a) is not.

The result involving the path from NA to work overload is not
significant and positive. Thus, there is no empirical support for H6.
The model test results demonstrate that work overload depicts sig-
nificant negative relationships with both creative performance and
career satisfaction. Therefore, both H7(a) and H7(b) are supported.

Notes: Nonsignificant paths from control variables to model constructs were constrained to
‘‘0’’ on the basis of the initial results of the path analysis. Age and education were measured
using five-point scales. Tenure was measured using a six-point scale. The number of children
was measured using a four-point scale. Higher scores indicated older age, more educated,
longer tenure, and more children. Gender was coded as a dichotomous variable (0¼ male
and 1¼ female). Marital status was also coded as a dichotomous variable (0¼ single or
1¼ married). NA¼ Negative Affectivity; WLOAD¼ Work Overload;
divorced
W-FCON¼ Work-Family Conflict; F-WCON¼ Family-Work Conflict; CRP¼ Creative
Performance; CSAT¼ Career Satisfaction; TINT¼ Turnover Intentions. GFI¼ Goodness of
Fit Index; NNFI¼ Non-Normed Fit Index; CFI¼ Comparative Fit Index; RMSEA¼ Root Mean
Square Error of Approximation; RMR¼ Root Mean Square Residual.
The t-values demonstrate a statistically significant relationship at the .05 level. The other

and

t-values without any asterisks are insignificant.

In addition, the relationship between creative performance and
career satisfaction is significant and positive. Thus, H8 is sup-
ported. Lastly, the results illustrate that career satisfaction has a
significant negative impact on turnover intentions. Therefore, H9
is supported.

Age and gender demonstrate significant effects on work-family
conflict. Specifically, older employees experience greater conflict
between work and family domains. In addition, female employees
have higher work-family conflict.

As shown in Table 2, the model explains 1% of the variance in
work overload, 22% in work-family conflict, 11% in family-work
conflict, 3% in creative performance, 20% in career satisfaction,
and 20% in turnover intentions.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS

A model examining the selected antecedents and consequences of
work-family conflict and family-work conflict was developed and
tested based on data obtained from a sample of full-time frontline
hotel employees in Northern Cyprus as the study setting. In light
of the results of the path analysis, the majority of the hypotheses were
supported.

Consistent with prior studies (Bruck and Allen 2003; Stoeva et al.
2002), the hypotheses suggesting that NA intensifies work-family
conflict and family conflict were confirmed by the empirical data.
Accordingly, employees who tend to perceive events and individuals
in a generally more negative manner experience greater conflicts
between work (family) and family (work) domains. The findings that
work overload exacerbates work-family conflict and work overload
does not have any bearing on family-work conflict are partially con-
sonant with other empirical studies (e.g., Aryee et al. 1999; Aryee et
al. 2005). Specifically, the results show that frontline employees who
are confronted with heavy workloads experience greater work inter-
ference with family. The insignificant finding between work overload
and family-work conflict may be attributed to the fact that family-
related variables are the potential antecedents to family-work conflict
(Frone 2003).

The consequences of work-family conflict and family-work con-
flict examined in this study are creative performance, career satisfac-
tion, and turnover intentions. According to the findings of the
present study, neither work-family conflict and nor family-work con-
flict is a significant predictor of creative performance. Prior research
has reported that exhaustion mediates the relationships of job
(e.g., work-family conflict) with in-role performance
demands


Karatepe, Kilic, and Isiksel

19

(Bakker, Demerouti, and Verbeke 2004). Accordingly, the inclusion
of exhaustion as a mediator in the relationships between conflicts
in the work-family interface and creative performance might be a
potential remedy.

Conflict between work and family domains diminishes career
satisfaction. However,
the result pertaining to the relationship
between family-work conflict and career satisfaction is not signifi-
cant. As Wayne, Musisca, and Fleeson (2004, p. 124) state, ‘‘. . . per-
haps individuals psychologically attribute blame for the interference
to the source role, . . . experience negative affect toward that role.’’
Consistent with this statement, the results of this study demonstrate
that frontline employees’ satisfaction with their career decreases
due to work-family conflict. The findings of the study provide sup-
port for the positive relationship between family-work conflict and
turnover intentions. This is in accordance with recent research
(Haar 2004; Karatepe and Baddar 2006). This finding suggests that
frontline employees attach high priorities to their family roles and
think of leaving the organization when they cannot establish a
healthy balance between family and work domains. The result
regarding the impact of work-family conflict on turnover intentions
is not significant. This is not consonant with that of Karatepe and
Kilic (2007). Work-family conflict appears to be inevitable in front-
line service jobs. Thus, frontline employees might not have intended
to leave the current organization due to conflict between work and
family domains.

The study results demonstrate that there is no significant relation-
ship between NA and work overload. This is not consistent with that
of Iverson et al. (1998). This result suggests that NA does not lead
to perceptions of work overload. According to the study findings,
frontline employees who are confronted with heavy workloads have
lower creative performance and less satisfaction with their career.
And creative performance displayed by such employees increases
their career satisfaction. In accordance with prior research (Igbaria
and Siegel 1992), higher levels of employees’ career satisfaction
reduce their turnover intentions.

Management Implications

A number of implications for managerial practice emerge from the
study findings. First, as convincingly discussed in recent studies, the


20

SERVICES MARKETING QUARTERLY

lack of contemporary human resource management techniques is one
of the major problems in the hotel industry (Rowley and Purcell
2001; Zhang and Wu 2004). This is also valid for the Northern
Cyprus hotels (Karatepe and Kilic 2007). Thus, there is a great need
for establishing and sustaining a family-supportive work environment
in the hotel industry. Having family-supportive practices in the work-
place may lead to several benefits such as on-site child care services
and convenient work hours. Training employees in such a work
environment
in behavioral skills and product knowledge may
enhance their creative performance. This practice may also increase
employees’ feeling of ownership of the service encounter.

Second, managers should consider having employees who fit the
frontline service positions. This starts at the point of recruitment.
Trying to acquire and retain a pool of employees who fit the frontline
service jobs is of great importance to delivery of service quality. In
addition, managers should market a career rather than a job in order
to have such employees. These implications are significant, since the
study findings indicate that high NA employees have greater work-
family and family-work conflicts and female employees and older
employees experience higher conflict between work and family
domains. Finally, specific workshops can be arranged to teach
employees about how to establish a healthy balance between work
(family) and family (work) responsibilities. Mentors can also be
employed to provide employees with professional assistance to
establish such a balance.

Limitations and Future Research Directions

It should be underscored that some caveats are of note. First, the
cross-sectional nature of this empirical study precludes us to draw
reliable conclusions pertaining to the causal relationships among
the study constructs. Therefore, future research should design longi-
tudinal studies to avoid such a limitation. Second, this study relied
upon self-report data to test the hypotheses. However, this practice
is prone to common method variance (Doty and Glick 1988). Thus,
future studies should use multiple sources of data in order to
minimize this problem.

Third, the work-family research has been dominated by the role
stress perspective (Aryee et al. 2005; Grzywacz and Marks 2000). How-
ever, participation in multiple roles can produce a number of benefits.


Karatepe, Kilic, and Isiksel

21

Therefore, it would be beneficial to examine the antecedents and
consequences of two directions of conflict and facilitation between
work and family roles in future studies. Lastly, replication studies
among frontline employees in different service contexts (e.g., banks,
travel agencies, hospitals, airlines) would be fruitful to cross-validate
the study results and broaden the database for further generalizations.
