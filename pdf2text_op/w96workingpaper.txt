Corporate Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value
The role corporations should play in achieving social objectives is a topic with a lengthy history of
debate. Significant recent interest has focused on the impact corporate activities have upon the
natural world and the environment. This paper examines the link between corporate
environmental responsibility--measured by environmental reputation indices--and shareholder
wealth. Investors in a portfolio of firms enjoying above-average reputations for corporate
environmental responsibility earn risk-adjusted returns significantly greater than either the overall
market or portfolios composed of less environmentally-responsible firms. These results are
supported by preliminary evidence concerning the value of adopting the CERES Principles, a formal
code of corporate environmental responsibility.

I. Introduction

Recent years have seen a marked shift in many businesses' attitudes towards the environment. In
the face of changing consumer attitudes, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, threats
of large-scale climate change and a perceived scarcity of natural resources, "business as usual" is
taking on an emerald hue for many managers. Most visions of a sustainable future include a world
in which corporations prosper by meeting the needs of a stable population and by minimizing
their impact on the natural environment (Gladwin, Kennelly and Krause 1995; Shrivastava 1995a).
"Pollution prevention," "design for the environment," "industrial ecology," and "total quality
environmental management" are a few of the strategies currently promoted to help achieve this
end. But does it really pay to be "green"? Corporations are, after all, at least nominally responsible
to their shareholders, who presumably anticipate some return for the use of their capital. Unless
corporate policies yield financial as well as environmental benefits, it is unlikely investors will
commit the resources necessary to ensure the transition to a sustainable economy. It is therefore
of critical importance to investigate the relationship between corporate environmental
responsibility and shareholder value.

II. Background

Standard finance theory espouses maximization of shareholder wealth as the preeminent goal of
the financial manager. According to this paradigm, socially desirable investments that do not
directly benefit the firms' shareholders should not be undertaken (Friedman 1970; Malkiel and
Quandt 1971). Firms persisting in these behaviors, perhaps by donating a portion of their profits
to environmental organizations or by employing more environmentally sound but higher-cost
production processes, should yield investment returns inferior to businesses pursuing less lofty
aspirations. Stakeholder theory suggests just the opposite, arguing that managers must satisfy the
competing demands of many stakeholders (Freeman 1984; Cornell and Shapiro 1987).
Competitive advantage, and thus management's response to the needs of a particular stakeholder
group, depends upon the importance of that stakeholder group to the firm's overall strategy.
An abundance of articles, books, speeches and seminars touting the advantages of responsible
environmental behavior have appeared in the past few years. In brief, it is argued that green firms

will benefit from 1) pportunities from the sale of environmental services and "earth-friendly"
products, 2) Reduced waste treatment and/or disposal costs, 3) Decreased litigation and future
liability for environmental damages, 4) Improved credibility with the public, 5) More productive
employees and/or improved employee working conditions, and 6) Benefits accruing from less
antagonistic regulatory relationships (cf. Kleiner 1991; Cairncross 1992; Hawken 1993;
Shrivastava 1995b).

Environmental Responsibility and Competitive Advantage

Traditionally, managements have presupposed there to be many costs and few benefits associated
with environmentally responsible behavior. The generally antagonistic posture taken by many
industrial companies towards environmental legislation during the 1970s and an overall
reluctance to modify existing production technologies lend support to these observations. More
recently, several authors have explored the notion that actions undertaken by a corporation or
nation to reduce environmental impacts may actually confer competitive advantage vis-รก-vis
other firms or countries. Michael Porter is most closely identified with the belief that strict
environmental regulations improve a nation's competitiveness by encouraging efficiency and
innovation (Porter 1991). Recent empirical work by Sorsa (1994) and a thorough review by Jaffe et
al. (1995) find that more stringent environmental standards do not appear to have lowered the
United States' international competitiveness. Bezdek (1993) and Repetto (1995) argue that on
balance, environmental regulation probably creates jobs, though Repetto is careful to note the real
issue is not jobs, but what a country's citizens want their economy to produce. Bonifant, Arnold
and Long (1995) report the results of case studies examining competitiveness issues in various
manufacturing industries. They find increased flexibility in environmental regulations provides
opportunities for firms to gain advantage over their competitors.
Hart (1995) proposes a theoretical framework for how a firm might gain competitive advantage
based on its relationship to the natural environment. He identifies three interconnected
strategies--pollution prevention, product stewardship and sustainable development--and
develops propositions concerning the ways in which these strategies might be translated into the
bottom line. Shrivastava (1995a, 1995b) and Gladwin, Kennelly and Krause (1995) argue quite
persuasively for an "ecocentric" or "sustaincentric" ethic as the key to corporate competitive
advantage in a future with a growing world population and decreasing natural resources.

Environmental Performance and Financial Performance

Historical evidence concerning the relationship between environmental performance and financial
performance has been mixed. Cochran and Wood (1984), Ullman (1985) and Davidson and Worrell
(1990) review over two dozen studies examining corporate social responsibility and firm
performance and find the results inconclusive, evidently due to differences in datasets, methods,
time periods and measures. Recent work has been more encouraging. Erfle and Fratantuono
(1992) find a positive relationship between environmental performance as measured by reputation
indices developed by the Council on Economic Priorities and financial performance measured in
terms of accounting variables. Russo and Fouts (1993), Swinnerton and Shinkel (1993) and Diltz

file:///Users/lsc6v/Desktop/OSI_pdf/WHI002.html[10/1/14, 1:11:20 PM]


Corporate Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value
(1993) report essentially the same results, the former study using accounting variables and the
latter two using stock market returns. Using an impressive array of control variables, Wolf and
Curcio (1994) conclude that financial performance (measured with accounting variables) and
environmental performance are also positively related.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collects annual pollution data and releases it to
the public in the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). Using the TRI data, several researchers have
reported recently that the financial performance of firms with lower toxic emissions is as good or
better than that of firms with higher emissions (Hart and Ahuja 1994; Cohen, Fenn and Naimon
1995; Repetto, 1995). However, studies conducted using environmental mutual fund data show
opposite results. Hamilton, Jo and Statman (1993) examined socially responsible mutual funds
and found no statistically significant excess returns. White (1995) tested environmentally-oriented
mutual funds in Germany and the United States, reporting a negative relationship between
environmental concern and financial performance.

Shareholder Value and Corporate Environmental Responsibility

If investors are not compensated for the use of their monies, they are unlikely to commit the
resources necessary to achieve socially desirable results, and thus throw open to question the vast
amount of effort currently devoted to enhancing corporate environmental responsibility. This
study therefore seeks to answer two key questions:

1) What is the relationship between shareholder value and a firm's reputation for
environmentally responsible behavior? and

2) How is shareholder value impacted by a firm's signaled intent to become more
environmentally responsible?

Earlier work has not provided wholly satisfying answers to these questions for several reasons.
First, most of the studies mentioned previously measure financial performance in terms of
accounting variables--return on assets, return on equity, and the like. Not only do these measures
ignore risk, but the relationship between accounting performance and shareholder value is
sufficiently tenuous to warrant a more direct investigation using market-based data. Second,
measuring environmental performance solely in terms of emissions or compliance with
environmental regulations ignores the benefits of a "green" reputation--benefits captured in the
form of increased sales of green products, decreased probability of consumer boycotts and
possibly more motivated employees. Third, with the notable exception of Wolf and Curcio (1994),
most researchers have used data from but one or two years and their results must necessarily be
interpreted as tentative.
The present study uses four years of data from the Council on Economic Priorities to test the
hypothesis that a superior reputation for environmental responsibility is associated with higher
risk-adjusted shareholder returns. The results of a preliminary inquiry investigating whether it is
possible for a firm to create its own reputation for environmental responsibility (by signing a set

of environmental principles) are also reported. Together, these analyses provide a partial answer
to the question, "Does it pay to be `green'?"

III. Method

Data

Information collected and published by the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP) was used to proxy
a firm's environmental reputation. CEP was founded in 1969 to inform and educate the American
public on corporate responses to issues of social concern. Over the years it has published many
reports highlighting the social records of numerous companies and industries. Researchers have
used data from these reports to investigate various aspects of environmental and financial
performance (e.g., Ingram and Frazier 1980; Stevens 1984; Wolf and Curcio 1994). In recent
years, CEP has perhaps become best known for its publication of Shopping for a Better World ,
an annual guide rating the social performance of numerous consumer products firms. At least two
studies have examined the relationship between environmental and financial performance using
this dataset (Erfle and Fratantuono 1992; Diltz, 1993).
CEP rates a firm's environmental performance using a simple three-element scale. Companies
receiving the highest rating ("green" companies in the present study), are characterized by "...
substantial positive programs, such as the use and encouragement of recycling, alternative energy
sources, waste reduction, green products and packaging, etc." and a relatively clean record of
major environmental regulatory violations. "Brown" companies are firms rated lowest on the scale,
indicating a poor public record of major accidents, significant violations and/or history of
lobbying against sound environmental policies. The description "oatmeal" is used for companies
receiving the middle rating--in CEP's words, "... nothing outstanding either positively or
negatively. As far as CEP can ascertain, [the] company is in compliance with minimum legal
standards, but has no significant proactive programs" (CEP 1991).
Reputational ratings for a sample of 97 companies listed on either the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) or the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) were obtained from the 1989, 1990, 1991 and
1992 editions of Shopping for a Better World , supplemented in one year by cep's companion
publication, The Better World Investment Guide (Alperson et al. 1991).[1] Table 1 lists the firms
used in this study together with their environmental reputation ratings.

Monthly stock returns for all firms rated by CEP and publicly traded on either the NYSE or AMEX
were used to investigate the relationship between shareholder value and a firm's reputation for
environmentally responsible behavior. Stock returns were obtained from the Center for Research
in Security Prices (CRSP). For each year, three portfolios--Green, Brown, and Oatmeal--were
constructed from information supplied by CEP. Monthly returns on these portfolios were value-
weighted using monthly equity capitalization figures also taken from the CRSP files. The CRSP
value-weighted index was used to estimate the return on the market and the risk-free rate was
proxied by monthly returns on three-month U.S. Treasury bills, as released in the Federal
Reserve Bulletin .
A firm's intent to pursue more responsible environmental policies was measured by its formal
adoption of the CERES nรฉe Valdez Principles, a corporate code of environmental conduct.[2] In
1989, shortly after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, an organization composed of representatives from
national environmental groups and the social investment community formed the coalition for
environmentally responsible economies (ceres) and drafted what was then known as the valdez
principles. Firms adopting these principles agreed to reduce waste, conserve energy, and in
general work towards improving the environment. Due in part to the specter of legal liability for
environmental mishaps, few major corporations initially agreed to sign the document (Barnard
1990; White 1992). The principles were recently amended to specifically address this and several
other stumbling blocks, with the result that several large companies have now signed on.
Unfortunately, only six of the 56 signatories in june 1995 were listed on either the NYSE, AMEX or
the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system (NASDAQ). The
remaining firms are either very small, privately held or both, and this dataset, although complete,
is limited in scope. The six firms used in this analysis and their signing dates are shown in table

Measures

Financial performance was determined using Jensen's alpha, a widely-used method of measuring
portfolio performance (Jensen 1968). The Jensen measure provides an estimate of a particular
portfolio's risk-adjusted performance, inviting comparisons with other portfolios and the market
index. The Jensen measure is based on a portfolio's ex post characteristic line and subject to all
the strengths and weaknesses associated with the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which provides its
theoretical underpinnings.[3] To estimate the line, monthly risk premiums were determined for
each of the three portfolios and the market index for the 48-month period from january 1989 to
december 1992. next, the monthly risk premiums on the respective portfolios were regressed
against the monthly risk premiums on the market index, as shown in equation (1).

where

Ki,t = return on portfolio i in period t

KF,t = return on the risk-free asset in period t

KM,t = return on the market index in period t

 is an estimate of the portfolio's systematic, or market risk. The intercept

The slope coefficient 
, also known as the Jensen measure , captures the

portfolio's risk-adjusted performance relative to the market. a significantly positive alpha
coefficient indicates superior performance (i.e., "beating the market") while a significantly negative
coefficient signals inferior performance. if the market is efficient, the capital asset pricing model

Peterson 1989; Henderson 1990). This analysis determines the extent to which a particular event
is associated with abnormal or excess returns. Patten (1990) has used this method to examine the
market reaction of firms signing the Sullivan Principles, a corporate code of conduct decrying
Sough Africa's policy of apartheid.
The market model was estimated for each security in the sample over a 255 trading day period
ending six trading days before the event date.[4] Event dates were defined as the day each firm
signed the CERES Principles and were obtained directly from CERES. The intercept 
 and slope 
parameters were determined from the ordinary least squares regression equation

where

Ri,t = return on security i for day t during the estimation period

RM,t = return on the market index for day t during the estimation period

Abnormal returns (ARi,t ) were computed for each security in the sample for each day during the
event period-5 to +5. the abnormal return on security i for day t equals

Abnormal returns were standardized by the standard error of the forecast (Patell 1976). Patell's
method allows the variation in the market during the estimation period to differ from the event
period and adjusts for the number of observations in the estimation interval. The standard error
of the forecast (SEFt ) equals

signing the ceres principles was likely to affect the different firms in the sample in different ways.
Automobile giant General Motors, for instance, was probably affected differently than socially-
conscious Ben and Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream. to correct for this, Boehmer, Musumeci and
Poulsen's (1991) standardized cross-sectional extension of the standard Patell test was used to
determine the significance of the abnormal returns during the event period. the Boehmer,
Musumeci and Poulson (hereafter BMP) test statistic is defined as:

Cumulative abnormal returns were computed for various event windows corresponding to pre-
signing : (-5,-1), signing (0,+1) and post-signing (+1,+5). An eleven-day test period was
chosen to avoid minimize the impact of confounding events and other news announcements.
moreover, if the market is efficient, new information is impounded nearly instantanteously into
stock prices. The cumulative abnormal return for firm i over period t1 to period t2 (CARi, t1 , t2 ) is

As expected, the beta coefficients are highly significant for all portfolios, indicating that risk is an
important determinant of portfolio return. The alpha coefficients are of greater interest, and Table
1 shows one could have earned superior investment returns over this period by purchasing the
common stock of firms rated "green" by the Council on Economic Priorities. These results indicate
(rather strongly; r2 = 0.73, F = 124.86) that it does, indeed, "pay to be green."
Having established the value of a green reputation and corporate environmental responsibility to
shareholders, it is worthwhile examining the impact of a firm's decision to signal this intent to the
investment community. Like the South Africa-related Sullivan Principles, the CERES Principles are a
key focus of shareholder activist groups (IRRC 1995). Table 4 indicates an immediate and
significant (t = 3.06) increase in shareholder wealth the day after firms pledged themselves to
pursue the responsible corporate behaviors outlined in the CERES Principles.

On average, shareholders in these six firms experienced a 1.05 percent increase in the value of
their holdings the day after the event. The sign test provides confirming evidence that this result
was not due to just one firm's response; 5 out of the 6 firms experienced a postive abnormal
returns the day of signing (Table 5). This wealth effect was not persistent across time, however. 
at the firm level. This finding is in direct contrast to White (1995), who reported strongly negative
risk-adjusted returns for environmentally-oriented mutual funds in the United States and
Germany over a time period roughly comparable to that used in the present study. If the mutual
funds studied by white invested in the same "green" firms used in this study, as seems likely, then
the poor performance of green mutual funds lies more with fund managers than with the
component investments themselves. Moreover, negative screens to exclude firms perceived as
"brown" from one's investment set would seem of little value, as both "brown" and "oatmeal"
portfolios earned returns commensurate with their level of risk.

Recommendations for Managers

It is interesting to consider the mechanisms by which a favorable environmental reputation might
create value for a firm's shareholders. Since adoption of the CERES Principles appears to increase
shareholder value, their texts provides initial guidance for these musings. Principles Two and Four
focus on the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources and energy--strategies which
would seem to reduce costs in the long run. principle three, emphasizing pollution prevention,
waste reduction and recycling, may also yield cost advantages as firms cut down on double
payments--once for the raw materials themselves and again to dispose of byproducts generated
during production processes.
Informing the public (Principle Eight) also seems important. A firm's reputation is often judged by
the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of its communication with third parties. The recent increase
in corporate environmental reporting practices is testimony to the importance of this process
(UNEP 1994; Ditz, Ranganathan and Banks 1995). Of course, a firm must be careful to avoid
"greenwashing" while promoting its environmental responsibility claims or this strategy may
backfire (Rehak 1993).

Public Policy Implications

The chief implication of this study for public policy is that markets can and do work to further
environmental aims; corporations are part of the solution as well as part of the problem
(Shrivastava 1995a). If the results presented in this paper are generalizable and sustainable, there
is every reason to believe the marketplace will effect improvements in environmental quality
without resorting to the "one size fits all" command-and-control approach. Recent legislation
enacted in the United States is already moving in this direction. Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, for

instance, electric utilities are allowed to buy and sell emissions permits, thereby achieving an
overall decrease in sulfur dioxide emissions (a key component in acid rain) in the most efficient
and cost-effective manner.
Government intervention will still be necessary to address issues of market failure and to ensure
the internalization of appropriate costs. But market-based solutions are likely to be the most
effective. Ecological economics scholar Robert Costanza recommends three policy instruments (a
natural capital depletion tax, the precautionary polluter pays principle and a system of ecological
tariffs) to ensure markets help, rather than hinder, the quest for sustainability (Costanza 1994).
He notes, "The market incentive-based instruments suggested to implement the policies are
intended to do the job with relatively high efficiency and effectiveness. They are not the only
possible mechanisms to achieve these goals, but there is considerable evidence that they would
work rather well" (Costanza 1994, p. 393).

Suggestions for Future Research

Part of this study--the investment performance section--is subject to the reverse causality
criticism. It cannot be determined from the results presented in Table 3 whether increased levels
of corporate environmental responsibility cause higher risk-adjusted returns or whether more
profitable corporations are simply able to devote more of their resources to environmentally
responsible behavior. Teasing apart this "chicken and egg" relationship remains a challenging task
for future research, although preliminary results from the event study run on ceres signatories
suggests it is a commitment to environmental responsibility which is driving the increase in
shareholder wealth.
An enhanced commitment to environmental responsibility is unlikely to benefit all firms equally
well. In general, banks and other financial institutions have a much smaller impact on the natural
environment than chemical or paper companies.[5] Early work using CEP data on the paper and
steel industries supports the hypothesis of differential effects in different industries; this would
seem to be an area for fruitful investigation. In fact, Wolf and Curcio (1994) suggest a positive
relationship between environmental performance and financial performance is likely to be
strongest for firms with the greatest name recognition. The source of the CEP dataset used in this
study--Shopping for a Better World --emphasizes consumer goods firms (who are likely to be
very concerned about reputational factors). It would be enlightening to repeat the analyses in this
paper with a larger sample of firms from more diverse industries.
The event study results pose an interesting question: Can a firm enrich its shareholders by simply
adopting the CERES principles? The sample size is of course much too small to provide a definitive
answer, but from a practical standpoint, the answer is probably no. CERES doesn't allow just any
concern to sign the Principles. A rather lengthy period of negotiations generally occurs before a
firm is accepted into the CERES fold. In addition, Principle Ten requires an annual self-evaluation
and report on progress made towards implementing the Principles. The level of activity required to
join and maintain a company's membership in this community is indicative of a sincere
commitment to corporate environmental responsibility.
Finally, there is need for additional inquiry on the elements of a "green" reputation, and how to
prioritize these various components. Where should managements direct their attention first?

Pollution prevention? Energy conservation? Improved communication about risk? Further research
into this area holds promise for increasing our understanding of the relationships between
environmental performance, environmental reputation and financial performance. This study has
presented evidence that it pays to be "green." The next step is to find out why.

APPENDIX: The CERES Principles

Introduction

By adopting these Principles, we publicly affirm our belief that corporations have a responsibility
for the environment, and must conduct all aspects of their business as responsible stewards of the
environment by operating in a manner that protects the Earth. We believe corporations must not
compromise the ability of future generations to sustain themselves.
We will update our practices constantly in light of advances in technology and new
understandings in health and environmental science. In collaboration with CERES, we will promote
a dynamic process to ensure that the Principles are interpreted in a way that accommodates
changing technologies and environmental realities. We intend to make consistent, measurable
progress in implementing these Principles and to apply them to all aspects of our operations
throughout the world.

1. Protection of the Biosphere

We will reduce and make continual progress toward eliminating the release of any substance that
may cause environmental damage to the air, water, or the earth or its inhabitants. We will
safeguard all habitats affected by our operations and will protect open spaces and wilderness,
while preserving biodiversity.

2. Sustainable Use of Natural Resources

We will make sustainable use of renewable natural resources, such as water, soils and forests. We
will conserve nonrenewable natural resources through efficient use and careful planning.

3. Reduction and Disposal of Wastes

We will reduce and where possible eliminate waste through source reduction and recycling. All
waste will be handled and disposed of through safe and responsible methods.

4. Energy Conservation

We will conserve energy and improve the energy efficiency of our internal operations and of the
goods and services we sell. We will make every effort to use environmentally safe and sustainable
energy sources.

Corporate Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value

5. Risk Reduction

We will strive to minimize the environmental, health and safety risks to our employees and the
communities in which we operate through safe technologies, facilities and operating procedures,
and by being prepared for emergencies.

6. Safe Products and Services

We will reduce and where possible eliminate the use, manufacture or sale of products and services
that cause environmental damage or health or safety hazards. We will inform our customers of the
environmental impacts of our products or services and try to correct unsafe use.

7. Environmental Restoration

We will promptly and responsibly correct conditions we have caused that endanger health, safety
or the environment. To the extent feasible, we will redress injuries we have caused to persons or
damage we have caused to the environment and will restore the environment.

8. Informing the Public

We will inform in a timely manner everyone who may be affected by conditions caused by our
company that might endanger health, safety or the environment. We will regularly seek advice and
counsel through dialogue with persons in communities near our facilities. We will not take any
action against employees for reporting dangerous incidents or conditions to management or to
appropriate authorities.

9. Management Commitment

We will implement these Principles and sustain a process that ensures that the Board of Directors
and Chief Executive Officer are fully informed about pertinent environmental issues and are fully
responsible for environmental policy. In selecting our Board of Directors, we will consider
demonstrated environmental commitment as a factor.

10. Audits and Reports

We will conduct an annual self-evaluation of our progress in implementing these Principles. We
will support the timely creation of generally accepted environmental audit procedures. We will
annually complete the CERES Report, which will be made available to the public.
