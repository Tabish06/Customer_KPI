In this study we attempt to evaluate the stock value of Greek firms, which apply systems of
environmental management in the light of systemic risk. Risk is examined empirically with
the help of conditional volatility models of investment in environmental friendly firms. The
empirical analysis relies on financial econometric models, which determine the underlying
conditional volatility. We find that improved environmental management system and
environmental performance result in reductions in firms’ beta. Specifically, our empirical
estimates show evidence of volatility clustering, short- and long-run persistence of shocks
to the returns of the market and asymmetry in the leverage effect between negative and
positive shocks to returns. Finally, the macroeconomic factors proposed and included in the
analysis have no statistical significant influence on the beta estimates in almost all cases.

Introduction

Nowadays environmental cost steadily increases and more and
more firms, whose capitals are concentrated on environmental
products and services, make their appearance. This raises the
question whether business environmental policy and the
systems of environmental management are being attuned or
opposed to the evolution of the shareholder value. In order to give
an answer to this question we have to analyze and find out what
is being projected as evaluation of shareholder value indexes.
Firms or companies, as far as their relation to the environment is
concerned, are based mainly on the establishment of a flexible
legal system, which is capable to promote the environmental

harmonization and the effective application of the legal provi-
sions. The latter is in accordance to direct and objective
information towards the mass of share-hold market (share-
holders–stakeholders), which expresses interest in locating
enterprises with preferential discounted future business value.
The improvement of the pre-mentioned relation will
encourage the mass of business community to re-establish
its relation to the environment. In addition, the improvement
of the above relation and the financial effectiveness of every
firm are directly and indirectly influenced by the capital
market and the formation of the stock value within. At the
same time, based on a different prospective, environmental
management and policy are closely related to the modern

strategy of firms, due to the fact that they aim towards better
financial results. In other words, environmental management
is associated with increasing rate of environmental strategy
and becomes its organic part.

Due to these reasons, the question of compliance of the
operation of capital market with the environmental dimension
of business strategy arises. The scientific community already
deals with the issue of how it is possible that the two
superficially controversial aspects of “stock value” and “envi-
ronmental policy and management” can be finally related, at
the level of strictly business strategy as well as at the level of
capital market operation. The question that emerges is in what
way could the conditions that can effectively lead a capital
market network towards a perfect function consist of condi-
tions related to environmental management. If the answer is
positive then the two areas of business strategy evolution
could have mutual and compatible goals even at the level of
environmental strategy. In that case, the capital market and
the microeconomics system of each firm could affect each
other, with mutual gain, contributing to the achievement of
environmental policy and management's goals.

Our research mainly tries to highlight that the recognition of
relativity of corporate environmental policy and management
with the configuration of shareholder value is required to be
incorporated into a horizontal aspect of environmental policy.
This has to take place with all the manifestations of component
elements, which constitute the operation mechanism of capital
market under efficiency conditions. The reduction of in
question relativity in its horizontal dimension will elect the
necessity for planning a model (Horizontal equilibrium model),
which will interpret the peculiarity that the application lends
from the corporate environmental policy in the light of general
important macroeconomic and microeconomic factors that
prevail in the capital market they negotiate.

For the first time, we try to relate environmental policy,
management planning and the stock value for the case of Greek
companies. Using a sample of 11 Greek companies verified in
the Athens Stock Exchange Market and applying adequate
econometric techniques we reach a number of interesting
conclusions with the associated policy implications. At the
same time we apply a number of diagnostic tests in order to
justify and check the validity of the proposed models. Compa-
nies that make a reference for their environmental policy in the
annual financial report or publish an annual social report seem
to have a reduction in their beta estimates especially in sectors
that influence heavily the environment. Macroeconomic factors
seem to be insignificant in almost all cases.

The structure of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
reviews the existing literature. The data and the methodology
adopted are presented in Section 3 while Section 4 discusses
the empirical results extracted in the study. The Final section
concludes the paper.

Materials studied

Up to now research dealt with two different approaches trying
to discover and reveal the relations of interdependence of
corporate environmental policy and firms' shareholder value
and capital market in general. The upside approach aims to

analyze on one hand the influence of the incorporation of
environmental policy and systems of business strategy with the
direct effect on the level of conditions that form the shareholder
value of firms (Blumberg et al., 1997; Schaltegger and Figge,
2000). On the other hand, the downside approach focuses on the
financial and technical analysis of firms, which respond to the
stock market, from an outside approach. It relates the Stock
Exchange performance of firms in order to find the super-
normal profits that the recognition of the applied environmen-
tal policy adds to the changes of stock value.

The most important result is that an increasing environ-
mental sector performance has a significantly positive influ-
ence on the shareholder value. Feldman et al. (1997) suggest
that environmental improvement is recognized by the invest-
ing community and leads to a real decrease of business
expected risk (lower beta), which comes together with a rise of
stock market value of about 5%. According to Ziegler et al.
(2002) an increasing environmental sector performance has a
significantly positive influence on the shareholder value, but
in contrast, an increasing social sector performance has a
negative influence on the average monthly stock returns. In
the new era of environmental policy and innovation the ‘Win–
Win’ theory (Porter and Linde, 1995; Halkos and Evangelinos,
2002) support that the distinctive environmental regulations
and the proper financial tools open the way to innovation,
increase the productivity of inputs, decrease the total produc-
tion cost, improve the value and offer a comparative advan-
tage to the firm that works within a competitive environment.
But Hart and Ahuja (1996) pointed out that firm's effort on
restraining pollution by reducing emission of pollutants is
opposed to firms' net profit for a period of one to two years
after the beginning of environmental management and as a
result, firms with high levels of emission seem to have higher
profit. According to Palmer et al. (1995), Reinhardt (1999a,b) if it
is to pay to be green then firm's engagements in a voluntary
measure beyond compliance ought to be guided by consumers
and investors performance that are not necessarily captured
by regulations. Dowell et al. (2000) find that firms adopting a
single stringent global environmental standard have much
higher market values.

Capital Market value of state firms consists of an estimated
future obligation, which relates to environmental perfor-
mance. A connection between corporate environmental policy
and effectiveness is the risk associated with the investment,
which is determined in the capital market, and could as well be
characterized as ‘environmental recognition’ and inhere in
these two approaches (upside and downside). This is accom-
plished through the acceleration of information procedures
and in time distribution to shareholders and their consultants
as well as the domestic and international Institutional
Investor. Researcher's (Gentry et al., 1997; Reed, 1998) points
out that the majority of investing community can, under
proper information, accept the fact that environmental
performance constitutes an important index for the definition
of stock value. Yamashita et al. (1999) examining the relation-
ship between environmental conscientiousness scores and
stock returns find that the US capital markets have only weakly
rewarded environmentally conscientious companies.

Researchers also find that the decrease in stock price is
comparable in dollars value to the fines and penalties issued

by governance (Barth and McNichols, 1994; Karpoff et al., 1998;
Garber and Hammitt, 1998) while King and Lenox (2000) find
evidence of an association between lower pollution and
higher financial valuation. Thomas (2001) concluded that the
adoption of environmental policy as well as the continuous
prosecutions for violations of environmental regulations
could give a strong explanation, within the framework of an
analysis of excessive profit, to the shareholders who invest on
firms, which adopt a responsible environmental behavior.
Similarly, Hall and Rieck (1998) claim that announcements of
firm's donations have an important positive impact on
shareholder value. According to Blacconiere and Pattem
(1994) and Blacconiere and Northcutt (1997) the non-incorpo-
ration of environmental statement of a firm as well as the
distribution to the administration of inadequate accountabil-
ity results, cause problems to operational process and more of
these costs that could have been avoided. These additional
costs transfer through the capital market to stakeholders and
as a characteristic result stakeholders have paid a large
amount of USA environmental pollution (Ditz et al., 1995).

In the USA further forms of mandated reporting come from
the securities regulations and accounting professions disclo-
sure requirement for risk and environmentally related matters
(Goodman and Little, 2003). The operation of stock market is
more effective when the level and credibility of information are
available to the judgment of the investors. When new
information becomes available in the market, the uncertainty
of the investors decreases (for example the unemployment
and the price levels) and so show a willingness to re-establish,
in a relevant way, their demands according to the new levels of
uncertainty as far as firm's value is concerned (Gupta and
Goldbar, 2005). Hamilton (1995) investigated whether the facts
about pollution, which were pointed out, by the Environmental
Protection Agency (E.P.A.) and Toxis Release Inventory (T.R.I.)
in 1989 were ‘news’ about the journalists and the investors.
The analysis shows that the actual stock performance for
those companies was lower than the expected market adjusted
returns.

Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) remarked outstandingly
negative, unexpected under normal circumstances, results
when had to announce bad environmental news, like an oil
slick and on the other hand positive results when firms were
granted environmental awards. Lanoie et al. (1998) using
evidence drawn from American and Canadian studies indicate
that capital markets react to the release of information, and that
large polluters are affected more significantly by such release
than smaller polluters. Lorraine et al. (2004) reached the same
point by examining whether publicity (either good or bad) about
environmental performance affects British companies share
prices. Specifically they find that there is a stock market
response to such news especially for details on fines-typically
up to 1 week after news is published. But in their research Bosch
et al. (1998) pointed out that market responds negatively in
unfavourable announcements of E.P.A. about firm's wrong
environmental action.

The demand for sustainable financial services and rating
organizations contributed to the establishment of companies
and the creation of an annual corporate environmental index
of benchmark which focuses on counselling and informing the
investing community about companies, which apply sustain-

able environmental policy (Business in the Environment—BiE
index, Innovest-EcoValue21 Index). Financial houses like Dow
Jones and Financial Times in order to meet the case for new
profit from sustainable development have established the
Dow Jones Sustainable Group Index (DJSGI) and the Financial
Time Security Exchange for Good (FTSE4G), which are being
promoted as sustainable indexes.

According to Dobers and Cerin (2001), for the year 2001,
the performance of DJSGI compared to the performance of
DJGI, appear to be 2.5 times higher. Also the bad environ-
mental situation of firms creates many legal and financial
problems that should be paid by the financial market; and
second the financial institutions seize the opportunity for
raising their position in an oligopoly framework (Bouma
et al., 2001).

From the beginning of the idea of environmental protection
and sustainable development a new oligopoly market was
created in the funds community. The practice of strictly
environmental criteria adoption as well as the establishment
of “Green Funds” and ‘Green Mutual Funds’ is relatively recent.
The complete picture of social responsible investment is
determined by the Social Investment Forum (2005) as com-
prising three strategies: positive and negative screening
practices, shareholders activism and community-based in-
vestment programs. Individual groups of environmental
investors are now responding to poor corporate environmen-
tal management through active shareholding practices such
as shareholder resolutions and divestment strategies, in order
to pressure targeted companies to improve environmental or
social performance (Elkington and Beleo, 2000). Papers in this
field confirm that ‘Green Funds’ have positive efficiency with
respectable profit, while moral green investors don't pay the
‘risk premium’ for this investing attitude (White, 1995; Fayers
et al., 2000; Konar and Cohen, 2001). Finally Heinkel et al. (2001)
find that a key determinant of the incentive for polluting firms
to reform is the fraction of funds controlled by green investors.
In their model, empirically reasonable parameter estimates
indicate that more than 20% green investors are required to
induce any polluting firms to reform.

From the literature review it emerges that these downside
and upside approaches and the general theory of corporate
environmental policy cannot explain alone the differences
that lend the corporate environmental policy and manage-
ment in their shareholder values. But the most important is
that the literature presents the phenomenon that the capital
market has failed to incorporate effectively the corporate
environmental policy of firms. This failure implies that the
cross-correlation between the corporate environmental policy
of firm and shareholder value that is created in the capital
market form asymmetrical information, rigidities of prices
and oligopoly situations to individual sectors and markets. It
is recognized that the two factors that can promote simulta-
neously the corporate environmental policy with the opera-
tion of capital market is the availability of environmental
information and the relativity, or more precisely, the percep-
tible relativity. The latter constitutes cultural constitutive
element of social growth and social capital as well as corporate
governance principle for each society and at extension to local
capital market. And here enters the significance of horizontal
dimension of environmental policy.

Framework, methodology and data

The Efficient Market Hypothesis argues that new information
will be reflected in a stock's return. A company's risk profile
can be distinguished into two components: the systematic and
the specific or unique risk to the firm. The former form of risk
reflects factors such as changes in interest rates, oil prices,
inflation rates etc that affect all firms in the market
simultaneously. This implies that investing in a more
diversified portfolio cannot eliminate the risks posed by
those factors. This is in line with modern financial portfolio
theory, which concludes that investors require a return for
accepting only the systematic risk as firm-specific risk can be
diversified away. This reduction in systematic risk results to a
decrease in the cost of financial capital and, for a given cash
flow, in an increase in the stock price. A company's systematic
risk is measured by its “beta”, which is a measure of volatility
of the stock under consideration to the overall market with the
market's beta taking the value of 1. The higher a firm's beta,
the greater its systematic risk is. Companies with a beta
greater than 1 are more volatile compared to market. On the
other hand, companies with beta less than 1 are less volatile.

3.1.

Modeling environmental risk

In order to demonstrate the connections between changes in
environmental risk and a company's stock price then we may
consider firms that have publicly aligned its overall business
mission with a number of environmental objectives and
publicly acknowledges that its excellent business reputation
is mainly due to its environmental performance.

In our empirical estimation we use the Capital Asset Pricing

ð1Þ

Model (hereafter CAPM) formulation expressed as
ðRj−RfÞ ¼ b0j þ b1jðRm−RfÞ þ ej
where the stochastic disturbance term εj represents the effect
of unsystematic and diversifiable risk. We assume that εj has a
zero identically normally distributed mean. The term Rj−Rf rep-
resents the risk premium for security j while Rm−Rf the overall
market risk premium. Estimating β1 by OLS is equivalent to
b1j ¼ rjm

ð2Þ

r2
m

where σjm is the covariance between firm j's return and that of
the market in total and σm
2 is the variance of market's return.
Considering the CAPM model as a special case of a more
general model we proceed to the implementation of the
Arbitrage Pricing Model (hereafter APM). In this way, securities
are allowed to respond differentially to macroeconomic shocks
(or changes) such as unexpected oil price shocks or changes in
the inflation rates. That is, the APM is formulated as:
ðRj−RfÞ ¼ b0j þ b1jðRm−RfÞ þ b2j Factor1 þ b3j Factor2

ð3Þ
where factors 1 to 3 correspond to price of oil, industrial
production and inflation rate respectively.

þ b4j Factor3 þ Vt

In our last step we investigated the need to extend our model
to cope with ARCH effects and risk as an explanatory variable.
The most common used ARCH and GARCH models as intro-

duced by Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986) take the conditional
variance as a linear function of lagged conditional variances and
squared residuals. Theoretically these models are characterized
by linearity as they imply an ARMA equation for the squared
2 allowing a full study of the distributional
prediction errors ut
properties of ut as well as easier statistical inference.

A time series following a GARCH (p,q) model satisfies

ð4Þ

Yt ¼ Xtb þ vt
where X represents the vector of independent variables (and
the lagged dependent variable), β is a constant vector and vt
the disturbance term. The latter is defined as

variance. The ARCH effect (α
2i) shows the short-run persistence
of shocks while the GARCH (β
2i) indicates the contribution of
shocks to the long-run persistence.

Following Engle and Ng (1993) a joint diagnostic test for
non-linear ARCH effects is performed and is reported in the
last row of Table 2. The test relies on the following regression
ð6Þ

where εit are the standardized residuals, St−1 a dummy variable
taking the value of 1 if εit−1 is negative and 0 otherwise and Z a
vector of explanatory variables. The test statistic for this test is
the LM statistic (n⁎R2)∼χα2 with 3 degrees of freedom.

As the conditional variance in a GARCH formulation is a
function of the magnitude of the lagged residuals and not their
signs, this implies that one of the main restrictions of GARCH
models is that they rely on a symmetric response of volatility
to positive and negative shocks. Specifically, the GARCH
formulation proposes a symmetrical treatment of the effects
of these shocks on the conditional variance in such a way that
the effect of negative and positive shocks on the conditional
volatility to be identical.

It is argued that in financial time series, negative shocks
increase volatility more compared to equal positive shocks.
These asymmetries are usually attributed to leverage effects.
A reduction in the value of a company's stock increases the
firm's debt to equity ratio and the shareholder who bear the
residual risk of the firm consider their future cash flows as
more risky. Two popular asymmetric formulations may be
used in case of asymmetries: the Threshold GARCH or
TGARCH (Zakoian, 1991; Glosten et al., 1993) and the Expo-
nential GARCH or EGARCH proposed by Nelson (1991). A
limitation of the latter is the fact that the effects on volatility
of positive values relative to negative remain fixed in time.

The TGARCH is used here as it treats the asymmetric effects
of shocks and presumes that negative shocks have a higher
impact on volatility (and thus greater leverage) compared to
positive shocks of similar magnitude. A TGARCH (1,1) can be
formulated as

where It−1=1 if νt−1=0 and It−1=0 otherwise. If γ N0 then we
may have a leverage effect. The non-negativity conditions are
α0≥0, α1≥0, β≥0 and α1+γ≥0.

Thus the TGARCH's main advantage of the parameteriza-
tion is that it takes into account asymmetries in volatility as
well as the non-negativity of the parameters. This asymmetry
is important, as volatility tends to be higher after a decrease
than after an equal increase.

Data

In our analysis we constructed a “green” portfolio constituted
from 11 companies chosen from different sectors and which
were certified in the Athens Stock Exchange Market (ASE)
(mostly with ISO14000 or EMAS in the year 2001) for their
environmental situation. Data are available on a daily basis
from 2nd of January 1998 to 30th of December 2004. The source
of the data is the database created in the Laboratory of
Econometrics at the University of Thessaly.1

The returns of the bonds and of the General Index of the
Athens Stock Exchange Market are estimated as the ratio of the
difference between the values in period t (Pt) minus the values in
period t − 1 (Pt−1) over the values in period t −1. For the
approximation of the main macroeconomic variables we use
the consumer price index, the price of Brent oil and the index of
industrial production. Following Berndt (1991) we construct first
the rate of inflation, the growth rate in the real price of oil and
the growth in industrial production and then from each
constructed variable we subtract its corresponding sample
mean. Specifically, the rate of inflation (INFLRATE) is defined
as the consumer price index (hereafter CPI) in period t minus CPI
in period t−1 divided by CPI in period t−1; the growth rate in the

Statistics Service of Greece as well as the site http://www.
economics.gr/allMedia/gr/. The source of the European Brent Spot
Price is the US Department of Energy, Energy Information
Administration.

real price of oil (ROILPG) is defined as [(ROILPG/CPI)t−(ROILPG/
CPI)t − 1]/(ROILPG/CPI)t−1; and the growth in industrial produc-
tion (INDPRG) is defined as the ratio of the difference in
industrial production in period t minus the industrial produc-
tion in period t−1 over the industrial production in period t−1.
The risk free rate refers to the interest of the Greek Govern-
mental Bond Yield.

Table 1 presents the basic descriptive statistics and general
information concerning the macroeconomic variables and the
companies (like the sector) included in the sample under
consideration. We have also included the results of the unit
root tests (P-values in parentheses) where in all cases
stationarity is present.

Results

Table 2 presents the estimation results for the proposed model
formulation. The first row presents the parameters estimated;
the next two rows contain the parameters following the
notation of relationships (3)–(5) and (7). The beta coefficient β1
is significantly different from zero at all levels and in all cases.
The GARCH components are also significant suggesting that
there is an important ARCH component to the error process.
Coefficient γ2 has sensible magnitude and it is significant
suggesting that the risk premium is time varying. At the same
time γ0 and γ1 are significant but their magnitudes are
negligible. The coefficients on all three estimated terms in
the conditional variance equation are statistically significant
in all cases. The sum of the coefficients on the lagged squared
error and the lagged conditional variance is close to unity
implying that shocks to conditional variance will be highly

Heracles the TGARCH(1,1) estimates show, on contrary to
expectations, that ARCH (or δ1) estimates are insignificant. At
the same time the estimates of GARCH (or δ2) are again quite
high and significant. The parameter of asymmetry (δ3) is in all
cases positive and highly statistically significant. This implies
that negative shocks imply a higher next period conditional
variance compared to positive shocks of the same magnitude.
This means that the leverage of negative shocks is greater than
that of positive shocks and both the short-run persistence
arising from negative shocks and the long-run persistence of
shocks are highly statistically significant.

In the same table some diagnostic statistics and their
associated P-values can be found. The first and second rows in
the diagnostics give the results of the Box–Pierce test on the
residuals and the squared residuals. If the mean equation is
correctly specified all Q-statistics should be insignificant. In
the case of the GARCH model, the diagnostic tests were
applied again. The variance equation is correctly specified, as
in all cases the Q-statistics of the residuals are insignificant.
As the ARCH(1) test shows, the standardized residuals do not
exhibit additional ARCH effects.

To cope with the problem of non-normality indicated by
the Bera–Jarque test, a quasi-maximum likelihood procedure
(maximum likelihood with Borrerslev–Wooldridge standard
errors) was followed. The third, fourth and fifth give the LM
tests and the P-value for ARCH(1), ARCH(2) and ARCH(3)
specifications of the residuals and the seventh the Breusch–
Godfrey LM test for serial correlation. The last two rows of the
diagnostic tests present the Ramsey's RESET and the Engle–Ng
tests. As already mentioned, the test statistic for the Engle–Ng
test is the LM statistic nR2∼χα,3
2 and it is not significant at the
usual significance levels implying that the null hypothesis of
no asymmetries is not rejected.

To avoid autocorrelation and increase the explanatory
capacity of the models, we decided to incorporate in our
analysis as an independent variable the returns of a stock
lagged one period. The idea behind the selection is no other than
the effect that the existing (known) bond returns should have on
current developments. In financial markets existing situations
are very influential. Running the model with the bond return
lagged one day, gives both the beta estimate and the lagged
variable statistically significant. Finally, all the macroeconomic
variables are statistically insignificant with exceptions in two
cases; these of Hellenic Cables and Kreta Farm for the period
2001–2004. In all cases the final adopted models have no serious
problems according to the diagnostic tests.2

Concluding remarks

In this study, we tried to model environmental risk relying on
econometric models, which determine the underlying condi-
tional volatility. Our empirical results lead to a number of
conclusions. Generally speaking, there is a perceptible rela-

2 Similarly and using a sample of 13 non-certified representative
firms per sector fount in all cases but one (Barba–Stathis in the
food sector) show an increase in their beta estimates.

tivity; all companies with high environmental risk present a
reduction in their beta estimates. Specifically,

1. For companies that make a reference for their environ-
mental policy in their annual financial report and those
that publish an annual social report, beta has decreased in
the period 2001–2004 compared to the period 1998–2001.
Out of the eleven firms included in our “green portfolio”
three (Elais Oleaginous Prod. S.A., Halcor SA Metal Works,
Hellenic Cables S.A) make a reference for their environ-
mental policy in their annual (2003, 2004) financial report
and one publishes an annual social report (S&B Industrial
Minerals S.A.). For all these companies beta has decreased.
2 The three cases of increased beta estimates refer to
companies from low environmental risk sectors such as
Food, Clothing and Textile.

3. The macroeconomic factors have no statistical significant

influence on the beta estimates in almost all cases.

4. Shocks to the conditional variance are highly persistent.
Our empirical estimates show evidence of volatility clus-
tering, short- and long-run persistence of shocks to the
returns of the market and asymmetry in the leverage effect
between negative and positive shocks to returns.

Up to now in Greece there is no systematic availability of
environmental information and no governmental, political or
judicial applied decisions that would force the financial
intermediary investments to promote environmental policy
in firms. Additionally, there are no financial products like
eco-loans or annual environmental benchmark indexes for
the segregation of firms as environmental friendly (green)
or not.

It is notable that several Greek efforts (TITAN — Dow Jones
Sustainable Group Index, and Eurobank, Commercial Bank,
FTSE 4Good) are negotiating and drawing capital from the
international capital market due to their integration in Dow
Jones Sustainable Group and FTSE 4Good Indexes. The
existence of a special law that regulates the Stock Exchange
Market (Act 2992/2002 F.E.K. 54 A′/20-3-2002), induces firms
that negotiate in the Athens Stock Exchange Market (ASE) to
apply international accounting standards (I.A.S.s), which
could be included in the recognition of environmental
situations (see also Sepetis et al., 2005).

Day by day we realise that the mechanisms that lead to the
decline in environmental quality are so complicated and
interdependent so that the mapping out and application of an
effective overall policy in the fragmentary sector seems
reasonably infeasible. For example, an abrupt change of
investors to firms with right environmental policy is not
only a result of a big environmental accidental event — like
Exxon Valdez or an environmental statement (T.R.I.) that can
be explained for a short interval. Potentially the participants in
capital markets react to environmental news on an important
accident or an environmental fine, ignoring if this involves or
not damage for the environment and public health. This does
not irrevocably prove that sustainability will finally increase
the shareholder value. It simply means that capital markets
consider the information related to future environmental
expenses and that these news lead to a short-term reduction
of shareholder value.

One realization that is in effect for Greek but also interna-
tional reality is that there is no scientifically argued conceptual
definition that would fix the environmental or sustainable
effective capital market as well as the factors that contribute in
the characterization of capital market as environmental or
sustainable effective. It becomes clear that Environmental or
Sustainable Policy must be drawn and applied horizontally as to
incorporate also its environmental or sustainable “dimension”.
Its scientific approach (risk/return adjusted) has guided the
finance research into a more general equilibrium model
framework, representative of the economic theory of total
factors, which have repercussions in the stock's evaluation.

Henceforth it is obvious that in order to convince the
investment community more complex financial risk adjusted
return and multi-factor models are required. These will help
interpreting the relativity exempted from environmental bias
and exploitation of environmental subjects from firms and
financial institutions for the improvement of their short-term
oligopoly position.
