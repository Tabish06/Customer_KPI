We  evaluate the use of  firm-level union coverage rates in empirical mod- 
els  of  firm  behavior  and  performance.  We  focus  on  the  potential  for 
measurement error  in  both  firm-  and industry-level  data,  and  find  that 
firm-level union  coverage rates provide  more  precise  estimates of  union 
effects. Higher union coverage at a firm is associated with slower employ- 
ment  and  sales  growth,  decreased  productivity  in  nonmanufacturing 
firms,  increased productivity  in  manufacturing  firms, lower  profitability, 
and less investment in durable assets, such as research and development. 

Introduction 

In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the impact of  labor 
unions on the behavior and performance of firms. Higher unionization rates 
have  been  associated  with  reduced investment  in  plant,  equipment,  and 
research and development (R&D), decreased profitability, slower growth, 
and higher labor productivity.  In many empirical studies, industry unioni-

(Allen, 1984; Brown and Medoff,  1978; Clark, 1980).

The Effects of Unions on Firm Behavior  I 427 
zation rates have been used  as proxies for firms’ unionization  rates. This 
practice involves two potential problems. Industry unionization rates mea- 
sure a firm’s union coverage with error, and their use prevents the inclusion 
of industry-specific effects in econometric models of firm behavior. A grow- 
ing number of  studies have utilized firm-level union data that can, in princi- 
ple, provide a more accurate measure of  a firm’s union coverage.2 

In this paper, we utilize a new source of  firm-level union coverage data 
to evaluate the use of  firm-level data in  empirical models of  unionization 
and  firm  behavior  and performance.  These unionization  rates  are calcu- 
lated from Bureau of  Labor Statistics (BLS) union contract data and Stan- 
dard and Poor’s Compustat employment data (see Bureau of Labor Statis- 
tics).  We  focus on the potential  for measurement error in both firm- and 
industry-level  coverage  data,  and  examine  the  implications  of  omitting 
industry-specific fixed effects from these empirical models. 

Our  firm-level  unionization  rates  exhibit  substantial  variation  across 
firms in the same two-digit  SIC industry. For a subsample of  our data set, 
we are able to estimate the degree of  measurement error in our firm-level 
unionization rates by comparing them to independent firm-level coverage 
rates calculated by  Hirsch  (1991b).  Although nearly half  of  the observed 
within-industry  variation  in  our  firm-level  unionization  rates  is  due  to 
measurement error, substantial within-industry  variation remains. 

A  standard  source  of  union  coverage  rates  for  empirical  studies  of 
unionization  effects  is  the  Current  Population  Survey  (CPS).  The CPS 
does  not  identify  employers,  and  therefore  cannot  be  used  to  compute 
firm-level unionization  rates. If  the aim in an empirical study is to control 
for firm-level unionization, then  by  maintaining the  “classical” measure- 
ment error assumptions, we show that our admittedly noisy firm-level rates 
are  a  better  proxy  than  are  the  CPS  industry  rates  for  a  firm’s  true 
unionization  rate.  However,  if  industry  average  unionization  rates  are 
desired for a specific application, then it is unlikely that an alternative data 
set could rival the depth of  coverage of  the CPS.3 
* These studies include Clark (1984), Ruback and Zimmerman  (1984), Abowd (1989), Bronars and 
Deere (1993b). Card (1990), and Hirsch  (1991a,b, 1992). 

In some  applications,  the industry  unionization  rate may provide  a better measure of  the union 
environment facing a firm, particularly  when “threat effects” are thought to be important. A limitation 
of the CPS is that it uses U.S. Census industry codes. Thus, reliable estimates of unionization  rates by 
three-digit  SIC codes  are  generally  infeasible  from  the  CPS.  The vast  majority  of  publicly  traded 
firms-firms 
in  more  than  one four-digit  SIC 
industry, while many operate in multiple three-digit U.S. Census industries, and several even produce 
output in more than one two-digit SIC industry. Thus, assigning an industry unionization  rate to each 
firm is problematic. The best approach would be to take weighted averages of industry rates where the 
weights were proportional to a firm’s activity in each industry. The necessary line-of-business data are 

for  which  other  data  are  readily  available-operate

An important benefit of  firm-level unionization rates is that they permit 
estimation  of  models  with  industry  fixed  effects,  and  allow tests  of  the 
hypothesis  that unobserved  industry  factors are uncorrelated  with union 
coverage  and other regressors.  We generally fail to reject these specifica- 
tion  tests,  and  proceed  to  use  random-effects  estimators  in  conjunction 
with our firm-level data. We then find that the precision of these estimated 
unionization  effects falls sharply, however, if  we substitute CPS industry- 
level coverage rates for our firm-level coverage rates. 

In  our  empirical applications we  estimate union  effects on  several as- 
pects of  firm behavior: growth, profitability, productivity, and investment 
in  plant  and  equipment,  R&D,  and  advertising.  We  find  fairly  strong 
evidence  that  higher  unionization  at  a  firm  is  associated  with  slower 
employment  and  sales  growth,  decreased  productivity  in  nonmanufac- 
turing firms, and increased productivity in  manufacturing  firms.  We  also 
find  weaker  evidence  that  higher  unionization  at  a  firm  leads  to  lower 
profitability  and  less  investment  in  durable  assets,  such  as  R&D  and 
advertising. 

Empirical Methodology 

Consider  the  following  econometric  model  of  firm  behavior  and 

performance: 

where the subscript ij denotes firm i and industry j, Yij is an indicator  of 
firm behavior, Xij is  a vector of  control variables,  Uij is the fraction  of  a 
firm's workforce  covered by  union  contracts, and  eij is an error term.  In 
many applications it is reasonable to expect that eij contains an unobserv- 
able industry-specific component , Sj: 

where  eij is  identically, independently  distributed.  For  example,  Sj may 
represent  unobserved  industry-specific R&D  and  investment  opportuni- 
ties, barriers to entry, or growth opportunities in industry j. If  these unob- 
servable  industry-specific  factors  are  correlated  with  union  coverage, 
ordinary-least-squares (OLS)  regressions  yield  inconsistent  estimates  of 
union effects4 Even if  these industry-specific factors are uncorrelated with 

generally quite difficult to assemble. See Salinger (1984) and Bronars and Deere (1993a), however, for 
empirical analyses that use such a weighted average measure of unionization. 

If Sj is uncorrelated with union coverage but is correlated with some other regressor in X, then the 
OLS coefficient on union coverage will  still  be  biased unless X,  and unionization are  uncorrelated. 


The Effects of  Unions on Firm Behavior  I  429 
a firm’s observable characteristics, the OLS-reported standard errors for p 
and T will be biased toward zero. 

Industry fixed-effects models consistently estimate /? and T ,  regardless of 
this ~orrelation.~ A fixed-effects specification of  (1) amounts to estimating 

DY,, = DXij/? + 7DUij + eij, 

where the operator D denotes deviation from industry means; hence DU,, 
= Uj - uj, where uj is the mean unionization rate in industry j. Estimates 
based on within-industry variation are not contaminated by  unobservable 
industry factors, even if  these factors are correlated with unionization or 
other regressors.6 Using (1’), it is possible to estimate  consistently even if 
Sj is correlated with Uij. 
Alternatively,  industry  random-effects  (GLS)  models  yield  consistent 
estimates of /? and T only if  Sj is uncorrelated with Xi, and the unionization 
rate. In this case OLS, fixed-effects, and GLS estimates are all consistent, 
but the GLS estimates have the lowest variances. Given firm-level data, it 
is possible to test for correlation between unobserved industry effects and 
regressors by  comparing fixed-effects estimates of  (1’) that treat the 8, as 
parameters  to  GLS  estimates  of  (1)  that  treat  the  Sj as  random  (see 
Hausman, 1978). These specification tests provide valuable information on 
the  importance  of  omitted  industry  factors  and  the  appropriate  econo- 
metric model for estimating unions’ effects on firms. 

Because of  data limitations, many studies use the CPS industry unioni- 
zation  rates,  denoted by  UCPS,,  as a proxy for U,,. This approach pres- 
ents  two  potential  problems.  Estimates  of  7 using  industry-level  union 
data  are  biased  toward  zero  because  of  measurement  error.  This  bias 
with  error.  If  UCPS, accurately  measures u,, then DU,, is the measure- 
occurs because a firm’s behavior depends on Uij, and UCPS, measures Uij 
- ment  error component  of  the proxy variable UCPSj. If  UCPS, measures 
U, with error, then the within-industry variance, Var(DUij), gives a lower 
bound for the variance of  the measurement error component  of  UCPSj.7 
The magnitude of  this downward bias will  be larger, the greater the true 
within-industry  variation  in  union  coverage.  However,  measurement  er- 
ror  is  not  unique  to  industry-level  data; firm-level union  coverage rates 
are also likely to be measured with error. The smaller the measurement 
error in firm-level union  rates, and the greater  the within-industry varia- 

Note, however, that Pk is identified only if  XI,, varies within industries. 
It  is  also  possible  that  the inclusion  of  industry  effects  reduces  measurement  error that  may  be 

present in our firm-Ievel union variable. 

could introduce measurement error problems.

tion  in  union  coverage,  the  greater  the  benefit  from  using  firm-level 
unionization data. 

In addition, the use of  UCPS, precludes industry fixed-effects estimation 
because UCPS, has no within-industry variation. If  6, is correlated with Xi, 
or UCPS,, then  as noted above GLS and OLS estimates using UCPS are 
inconsistent.  Without prior information  (see Hausman and Taylor, 1981), 
it  is impossible to test whether such correlation  between  industry factors 
and unionization  is present when  using  industry-level union  data such as 
UCPS.

where p, T ,  and 6, are assumed to be time invariant. A key problem with 
this  approach  is  that  measurement  error in  Uijt may  be  exacerbated  by 
differencing (Freeman,  1984). In the next section, we show that both our 
firm-level unionization  rates and UCPS are rather noisy  measures of  the 
true Uij. We then provide estimates of the relative variance of the measure- 
ment error component of  UBLS using an independent source of  firm-level 
unionization rates. 

Evaluating the Reliability of Firm-Level  Unionization  Rates 

We construct firm-specific unionization rates from all “major” U.S. col- 
lective bargaining agreements reported to the BLS, i.e., those involving at 
least  1,000 workers.  Our BLS contract sample contains over  10,000 con- 
tracts in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries (excluding public 
sector  and  construction  contracts) from  1971 to  1989.8 We  match  these 
union employment data to the total employment of  publicly traded firms in 
the  Compustat  database  as  described  in  the  appendix.  In  our  matched 
sample, we  compute the ratio of  union to total  employment,  denoted as 
UBLS,, (for firm i  in  industry j), in each year from  1971 to 1982 for 560 
firms. In our empirical applications, we use average levels of  UBLS,, com- 
puted over three different time periods:  1971-74,  1975-78,  and 1979-82.9 
Table  1  provides  for each  time  period  the  decomposition  of  the  total 
variance  in  UBLS,,, into the variance within  and  between  two-digit  SIC 
industry classifications. In each time period at least two-thirds of  the total 

*These data were collected from various issues of the annual BLS publication, Bargaining Calendar, 

which provides information on major contracts scheduled to expire in that year. 

We  chose these time  periods because the number of union contracts declines dramatically  in the 

1980s and substantially reduces our potential sample size.

variation in UBLS,, is within a two-digit industry. These results suggest that 
there  may  be substantial differences in  true union  coverage  rates across 
firms within the same two-digit industry, which implies that the CPS indus- 
try  average  may  be  a  poor  proxy  for  a  firm’s union  coverage.  Whether 
UBLS,, is a superior proxy for Uij depends on how much of  the observed 
variation  in UBLSij is due to measurement error compared to true varia- 
tion in Uij. 

The most  direct approach  to assessing  the measurement  error compo- 
nent of  UBLSij is to obtain an independent measure of  firms’ union cover- 
age  ratios  for  our  sample.1°  Hirsch  (1991b)  has  constructed  firm-level 
unionization  rates  for  a  sample  of  large  publicly  traded  firms  in  1977, 
which we denote by UHij.ll We can obtain estimates of  measurement error 
variances by examining the covariation between these independently calcu- 
lated  measures  of  union  coverage for the  194 firms that  are common  to 
both samples. 

In  our  empirical  applications,  there  is  considerable  evidence  that 
industry-specific effects explain a substantial portion of  the observed varia- 
tion in behavior and performance across firms. Throughout the empirical 
analysis that follows, we reject the simple OLS specifications in  favor of 
industry-fixed  or  random-effects  models.  Therefore  our  discussion  here 
emphasizes obtaining estimates of  the within-industry  measurement error 
in our firm-level data, i.e., measurement error in DUBLSij. 

Suppose  that  both  the  BLS  contract  data  and  Hirsch’s  data provide 

Greene (1990, pp. 293-303)  provides a useful discussion of the issues involved. 
See  Hirsch  (1991b)  for  details. The  means  and  standard deviations  of  UH  and  UBLS  in  the 
matched  sample are  ,468 (.225) and  ,327 (.225), respectively. The comparable  statistics for the  full 
samples are  ,380 (.300) and .329 (.281) for UBLS and UH, respectively.

where  EBLS,, and EH,, are zero mean  i.i.d.  measurement  error compo-

Var(EBLS)  = Var(UBLS)  - Var(U)

(4b) 
The  inclusion  of  industry  dummy  variables  in  regression  analyses  of 
union effects implies that  the resulting estimates depend on only within- 
industry variation. The variation in true unionization rates can be decom- 
posed  into  within-industry  and  between-industry  components.  If  the 
within-industry deviation in UBLS and UH, denoted DUBLS and DUH, 
are independent, then the true within-industry variance is given by12 

Var(DU)  = Cov(DUBLS,DUH), 

while 

Var(DEBLS) = Var(DUBLS)  - Cov(DUBLS,DUH). 

In a similar fashion the between-industry variance, Var(u), equals 

Var(TS)  = COV(UBLS, UH),

where the "  " indicates industry means. Equations (3)-(6)  can be used to 
estimate  the  fraction  of  the  variance  in  UBLS  (total  variance  and  its 
within-  and  between-industry components)  that  is  due  to  measurement 
error. 

l2 If we had prior information that measurement error was more of  a problem in some industries, we 
would  weight  observations  differently  on the  basis  of  a  firm's  industry.  Our maintained  hypothesis 
throughout the analysis is that measurement error variances are equal for each industry. 


The Effects of  Unions on Firm Behavior  I  433 
Finally, information on the measurement error component of  UCPS, can 
also  be  obtained.  The  mean  squared  error  of  UCPSj  around  the  true 
unionization  rate, Uij, can be written as 

MSE(UCPS) = Var(DU) + A ,  

(7) 
where A  2 0 is the weighted (by number of firms) average across industries 
of  the squared difference between  UCPSj and u,. Thus the true within- 
industry variance, which equals Cov(DUBLS,DUH) from (5a), provides a 
lower bound on the error from using UCPSj as a proxy for Uij. Also, the 
inclusion of  UCPS, precludes the use of  industry dummies. 

In Table 2 we  use  estimates of  equations (3)-(6)  for the  1975-78  time 
period to decompose the total observed variation in UBLS into within- and 
between-industry components and to estimate the percentages of  the over- 
all variation and of  these components that are due to measurement error. 
We find that the covariance between UBLS and UH, which is our estimate 
of  the true variance in union coverage (i.e., Var(U)), is 56.1 percent of  the 
total observed variance of UBLS. For comparison we find that 56.2 percent

of the total observed variation in Hirsch’s measure of  union coverage re- 
flects true variation  in unionization. Using the covariance of  DUBLS and 
DUH to estimate the within-industry variance  in  true  unionization  (i.e., 
Var(DU)), we find that true within-industry variation  in unionization  ac- 
counts for 53.9 percent of the observed within-industry variation in UBLS. 
The analogous estimate of Var(0) implies that true between-industry varia- 
tion accounts for 61 .O percent of the observed between-industry variation in 
UBLS. The comparison figures for Hirsch’s data are that 46.7 percent of the 
observed  within-industry  and  84.7  percent  of  the  observed  between- 
industry variation in UH reflect true variation in unionization. 

At  this  point,  it  is  worth  considering  further  the  possible  sources  of 
measurement error in UBLS and UH. UBLS is derived from contempora- 
neous  information  on  collective  bargaining  contracts  covering  at  least 
1,000 workers. As noted in the appendix, we adjust for workers in smaller 
contracts using data from 1974. Our coverage rates exclude workers cov- 
ered in multiemployer contracts because we cannot identify the employers. 
Hirsch’s data for  1977 are derived from three sources: (1) a retrospective 
survey  of  1977 coverage  conducted  in  1987;  (2)  adjusted  figures  from 
responses on 1987 coverage from the same survey; and (3) adjusted figures 
on 1972 coverage from a survey conducted around 1972. The survey ques- 
tions for 1977 and 1987 coverages referred to a firm’s entire North Ameri- 
can workforce. There are several potential  sources of  measurement error 
in Hirsch’s 1977 coverage rates:  (1) retrospective recall bias; (2) inclusion 
of  Canadian plants where unionization is higher than in the United States; 
and  (3)  inaccuracies  in  the  data  adjustments.l3  Our  priors  about  the 
greater potential for between-industry errors in UBLS was somewhat con- 
firmed  by  the  fact  that  UH is  a less noisy  measure  of  between-industry 
variation. The relatively better performance of UBLS in measuring within- 
industry variation may largely reflect the effect of  using contemporaneous 
information. 

Despite the  sizable within-industry measurement  error in  both  UBLS 
and  UH,  the  results  in  Table  2  confirm  that  UCPSj is  an  even  noisier 
measure of  Uij. Recall that true within-industry variation in Uij is a lower 
bound  for  the  measurement  error component  of  UCPSj. Table 2  shows 
that,  in  the  absence  of  measurement  error  in  union  coverage,  within- 
industry variation accounts for 66.2 percent (.0247/.0373) of  the total varia- 

13 The data adjustments are made  for about 27 percent  of  Hirsch’s entire  sample but  an unknown 
fraction  of the sample in common with UBLS. Inaccuracies in these adjustments  are exacerbated by 
the inclusion of  Canadian plants because  of  differences in unionization trends between  the two coun- 
tries. Note also that the inclusion of  Canadian plants helps explain the higher mean of  UH as reported 
in note  11.

tion in Uij. Thus UCPSj can account for at most 33.8 percent  of  the total 
variation  in  union  coverage  across firms.  Hence UCPSj appears to be  a 
noisier measure of  Uij than does either of  the firm-level unionization rates, 
UH or UBLS. When coupled with the fact that the use of UCPS precludes 
the  estimation  of  industry  fixed-effects, it  follows  that  firm-level union 
coverage  rates  can  provide  more  accurate estimates of  union  effects  on 
firm behavior.14 

Empirical Applications 

In  the  next  four  subsections, we  examine  the  relationship  between  a 
firm’s union coverage and its behavior and performance. We  estimate two 
cross-sectional regressions using variable  means calculated over the time 
periods 1975-78  and 1979-82,  respectively. Annual observations on each 
firm’s  union  coverage  are  combined  with  annual  data  on  firms  from 
Compustat  before  averaging.  We  estimate  separate  regressions  for  the 
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors, and we estimate the impact 
of  union coverage on firm behavior with and without a fairly extensive set 
of  control variables in the regre~si0n.l~ The coefficient on unionization in 
the specifications with the control variables estimates only the direct effect 
of unionization, holding several firm characteristics constant. On the other 
hand,  as stressed by  Hirsch  (1991b), the  union  coefficient in the regres- 
sions without other controls estimates both the direct effect of unionization 
and its indirect effect through changes in the control variables.  Each row 
of our tables presents a different empirical specification of the model using 
either  UBLS  or  UCPS  as  the  measure  of  union  coverage,  while  each 
column  represents  a  different  dependent  variablehime  period  combina- 
tion.  Because of  space limitations,  our tables present  only the estimated 
union coefficient and associated standard errors. l6 

For  regressions  using  UBLS,  we  estimated  industry  fixed-effects, 
random-effects,  and  first-differenced  regression  models. l7  For  each 

14  Industry fixed-effects and industry average unionization rates can be included in the same regres- 
sion if  the industry  level of  aggregation differs.  For example,  Connolly, Hirsch,  and Hirschey (1986) 
assign  unionization  rates  by  three-digit  U.S.  Census  industry,  and  include  one-  and  two-digit  SIC 
industry dummy variables in their  regressions.  A drawback to this approach  is that it requires a large 
firm to be  assigned  to a rather  narrow  industry  classification, even though  its employment  and sales 
may cut across a variety of  three-digit U.S. Census industries. 

15  Sample sizes vary  across  dependent  variables and  time  periods  because  of  missing data.  If  the 
regressions  with  larger  samples  are  reestimated  with  the  smaller  samples  of  other  regressions  the 
results are not materially changed. 

16  More details on the regression results are available from the authors.

random-effects regression, we test the hypothesis that 6, is uncorrelated with 
Xij and UBLS,,. When we fail to reject this hypothesis we report the more 
efficient random-effects estimates as the “Industry Effects” specifications. 
When we reject the hypothesis that 6, is uncorrelated with Xij or UBLS,,, we 
report the consistent fixed-effects estimates. For purposes of comparison we 
also present estimated union effects from OLS, random-effects,  and first- 
differenced regressions using UCPS. 

It is important to note that the estimated union effects we present based 
on  UBLS  have  not  been  adjusted  for  measurement  error bias.  If  46.1 
percent of  within-industry variation in UBLS is due to measurement error, 
consistent estimates of  unionization effects are obtained by multiplying the 
reported results by  1.855 = U(1-.461).  This adjustment factor applies to 
our estimated standard errors as well, and hence does not affect the signifi- 
cance level of  the reported  results.  An alternative  approach  to unbiased 
estimation  is to utilize an instrumental variables (IV) technique with  UH 
employed  as  an  instrument  for  UBLS.  We  did  not  take  this  approach 
because  it  would  have  greatly  reduced  our  sample  sizes,  especially  in 
nonmanufacturing. As a  check on the accuracy of  this adjustment, how- 
ever, we calculated  IV estimates for manufacturing for the  1975-78  time 
period  and  compared  them  to  GLS  estimates  derived  from  the  same 
(smaller) samples. The results of  this comparison were quite encouraging. 
For  the  profitability  and investment  regressions, the  IV  estimates of  the 
union coefficient were about twice as large as the  GLS estimates and the 
significance  levels  were  very  similar.  For  the  growth  measures,  the  IV 
estimates of  the union  coefficient were  about 25 percent  larger  than  the 
GLS estimates and the significance levels were again similar. The IV esti- 
mates of  union productivity effects were, on the other hand, insignificant. 
Thus  the  suggested  average  upward  coefficient  adjustment  of  about  80 
percent seems consistent with the results of  the IV procedure. 

Unionization and profitability.  A number of  authors (including Abowd, 
1989; Bronars  and Deere, 1990; Hirsch,  1991a,b; Ruback  and Zimmer- 
man, 1984; and Salinger, 1984) have examined the impact of  unionization 
on  the  profitability  of  firms.  In  this  section,  we  examine  the  impact  of 
higher union coverage on three different measures of  a firm’s profitability: 

ences in  UBLS and UCPS may be  even noisier measures of  the  true change in  Uij (see Bound  and 
Krueger, 1991). Although we present estimates of union effects based on first-differenced data, these 
estimated  effects  may  contain  a  substantial  bias  and  should be  viewed  with  some  skepticism.  See 
Freeman  (1984)  for  a related discussion pertaining  to estimates of  union wage  effects in  panel  data 
based  on  changes  in  union  status.  In  these  studies,  measurement error due  to misclassification or 
coding errors can result in sizable bias in estimated union wage effects. 


The Effects of  Unions on Firm Behavior  /  437 
(1) Tobin’s q ;  (2)  Excess Market  Value/Sales, the ratio of  excess market 
value of the firm to sales; and (3) Net Operating Income/Sales, the ratio of 
a firm’s annual net operating income to its sales.18 

We model a firm’s profitability as a function of  several lagged variables: 
log(Capita1 Stock/Employment), the logarithm of  the firm’s capital/labor 
ratio; Sales Growth, the annual rate of  growth in sales; Advertising/Sales, 
the ratio of  advertising expenditures to sales; and R&D/Sales, the ratio of 
R&D expenditures to sales.  Each  variable is calculated using Compustat 
data averaged over the preceding four-year period. For specifications in the 
manufacturing sector, we include Four-Firm Concentration Ratio, the four- 
firm concentration ratio in the firm’s primary industry, adjusted for imports. 
Table 3 presents the estimated profitability effects of  a change in union 
coverage. These effects are negative and statistically significant in manufac- 
turing in the random-effects regressions using UBLS and no other control 
variables. After controlling for a firm’s observable characteristics, the prof- 
itability effects are reduced by about one-half and are statistically signifi- 
cant only for Net Operating Income/Sales. In nonmanufacturing, there are 
significant negative effects of unionization on Tobin’s q and Excess Market 
Value/Sales in the random-effects  regressions with no  other control vari- 
ables. When  other regressors  are included,  only the effect  on Tobin’s q 
remains statistically significant. The first-differenced regressions generally 
yield insignificant results, with only marginally significant effects on Excess 
Market Value/Sales in nonmanufacturing. 

In  general, we find fairly strong and  significant evidence  that the total 
effect  of  higher  union  coverage  rates is to reduce  profitability. There is 
rather weak evidence that unions directly decrease profits, conditional on 
lagged values of  a firm’s capital/labor ratio, sales growth, and investment 
in R&D and advertising. After adjusting the random-effects estimates for 
measurement  error  bias,  a  10 percent  (between  3.5  and  4 percentage 
points) increase in union coverage reduces Tobin’s q by  1.5 to 2.5 percent 
in nonmanufacturing, and reduces Net Operating Income/Sales by 1.5 to 4 
percent  in  manufacturing.  These  results  are  consistent  with  Connolly, 
Hirsch, and Hirschey’s (1986) finding that unions indirectly reduce profit- 
ability through changes in investment behavior and growth. 

Estimated profitability effects using UCPS vary  substantially, depend- 
ing on the empirical specification. Both  OLS and random-effects  regres- 
sions yield  sizable negative  effects in  manufacturing.  The OLS standard 

I*  Tobin’s q is the ratio of a firm’s market value of equity plus book value of  debt to the book value of 
its tangible assets. Excess Market Value/Sales is a firm’s market value of  equity plus book value of debt 
minus the book value of its assets, divided by its annual sales.

The Effects of  Unions on Firm Behavior  /  439 
errors appear to contain a substantial  downward  bias,  due to the within- 
industry  correlation in  the disturbance term.  GLS models generally  lead 
to  imprecisely  estimated  and  insignificant  profitability  effects.  In  non- 
manufacturing,  estimates  based  on  first-differenced  regressions  using 
UCPS yield  large negative  and statistically significant profitability  effects 
for Tobin’s q and Net  Operating  Income/Sales.  In general,  however,  the 
first-differenced  estimates  differ  in  both  direction  and  magnitude  from 
the OLS and GLS estimates. 

Unionization and investment.  A number of  researchers have examined 
the  relationship  between  a  firm’s  investment  in  durable  assets  and  its 
unionization  rate (see Bronars and Deere, 1993a; Connolly,  Hirsch,  and 
Hirschey,  1986; Hirsch,  1991b,  1992; and  Hirsch  and  Link,  1987).  The 
maintained hypothesis is that unions are able to extract some of  the returns 
(quasi  rents)  to  such  intangible  sunk  assets,  hence  reducing  the  firm’s 
incentive to invest in these assets.19 We test this hypothesis by  estimating 
the  impact of  union  coverage  on a  firm’s investment  in  plant  and equip- 
ment,  research  and development,  and advertising. We  also estimate  the 
impact of  union coverage on the firm’s capital/labor ratio. 

The dependent variables  in  our  empirical  analysis  are  averages  over 
1975-78  and 1979-82,  respectively, of  (1) Capital Expenditures/Sales, the 
ratio of  expenditures on plant and equipment to sales, (2) R&D/Sales, (3) 
Advertising/Sales,  and  (4)  log(Capita1 Stock/Employment).  We  include 
Tobin’s q and Four-Firm Concentration Ratio (for firms in the manufactur- 
ing  sector)  as controls for  a  firm’s potential  profitability.  The additional 
control variables  are lagged values  (averaged over the previous four-year 
period)  of  Sales  Growth; log(Capita1  Stock/Employment);  R&D/Sales; 
and Capital Expenditures/Capital Stock, the ratio of  current investment to 
the stock of  plant and equipment.20 Capital Expenditures/Capital Stock is 
a measure of  the portion of  a firm’s capital stock that has been put in place 
in the recent  past,  and hence should control for some unobserved differ- 
ences in growth potential across firms. 

For two random-effects regressions in nonmanufacturing, Capital Expen- 
ditures/Sales in 1979-82  and R&D/Sales in 1975-78,  we reject the hypothe- 
sis that aj is uncorrelated with Xij and UBLS,,. Therefore, Table 4 presents 
fixed-effects estimates in these two cases and the more efficient random- 
effects estimates for the remainder  of the Industry Effects specifications. 

19 Grout (1984) and Baldwin (1983) develop theoretical models that imply that firms will underinvest 

in capital as a response to unionization. 

*O The controls that  are included vary some across dependent variables so that own  lags are never 

included. See the notes to the tables for the exact content of the controls in each regression.

442  /  STEPHEN G. BRONARS, DONALD R. DEERE, AND JOSEPH S. TRACY 

Table 4 shows that there are generally strong negative effects of  UBLS 
on investment in plant and equipment, R&D, and advertising in manufac- 
turing,  when  no other control  variables  are included  in  random-effects 
regressions.  Controlling  for  a  firm’s observable  characteristics,  the  esti- 
mated direct effects of  union coverage are roughly equal in magnitude but 
less precisely measured. The capital/labor ratio is higher in manufacturing 
firms with higher values of  UBLS in all the random-effects specifications. 
After  adjusting our estimates for  measurement  error bias,  a  10 percent 
increase in UBLS decreases R&D/Sales by 3.5-5  percent in manufacturing 
and decreases Advertising/Sales by 5-7  percent. The first-differenced esti- 
mates using UBLS are imprecisely measured,  and yield no significant  re- 
sults except for log(Capita1 Stock/Employment). 

In nonmanufacturing there is some evidence that an increase in UBLS 
is  associated  with  reduced  investment  in  R&D  and  advertising  and  a 
higher capital/labor ratio, but these effects often become statistically insig- 
nificant  after  controlling  for  a  firm’s  observable  characteristics.  After 
adjusting  for  measurement  error  bias,  a  10 percent  increase  in  UBLS 
decreases Advertising/Sales by  3.5-6.5  percent.  The first-differenced re- 
gressions using UBLS in nonmanufacturing yield  statistically insignificant 
results for all of  our investment variables. 

The regression  models using  UCPS  again  yield  widely  different  point 
estimates, depending on the empirical specification. Random-effects  esti- 
mates  are generally  statistically  insignificant  with  large  standard  errors; 
hence,  the  OLS reported  standard  errors  are again  misleading.  In  non- 
manufacturing  the  negative  and significant effects in the  first-differenced 
regressions are generally of  the opposite sign of  either the random-effects 
or the OLS estimates. 

Unions and  firm  growth.  Bronars  and  Deere  (1993a,b)  and  Hirsch 
(1991b) have examined the relationship between union coverage and firm 
growth. In this section, we estimate the impact of  unionization on a firm’s 
average  growth  rate  in  sales  (Sales  Growth)  and  employment  (Employ- 
ment Growth) over the periods  1975-78  and 1979-83.  We include lagged 
values  of  Tobin’s  q ,  R&D/Sales,  log(Capita1  Stock/Employment),  and 
Capital Expenditures/Capital Stock as control variables. Lagged values of 
a firm’s logarithm of  sales and employment  are included to allow for size 
effects on growth rates. In our manufacturing sample, we include the Four- 
Firm Concentration Ratio to control for differences in potential profitabil- 
ity across firms. We fail to reject the hypothesis that aj is uncorrelated with 
Xij and UBLSij in  any of  these specifications. Table 5  presents only GLS 
estimates for the Industry Effects specifications.

Table 5 shows that in both GLS and first-differenced regression models, 
there are significant  negative effects of  UBLS on  employment growth in 
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing.  Higher union coverage is also nega- 
tively associated with a firm’s sales growth in both manufacturing and non- 
manufacturing. In both the GLS and first-differenced models, these effects 
are generally insignificant in manufacturing and significant in nonmanufac- 
turing.  Adjusting  for  measurement  error  bias,  a  10 percent  increase  in 
UBLS reduces sales growth by about .25-.5  percentage points in manufac- 
turing, and .5-.75  percentage points in nonmanufacturing. Similarly, em- 
ployment growth rates are reduced significantly in all specifications; declin- 
ing by  .5-1.0  percentage points in manufacturing,  and  .6-1.1  percentage 
points in nonmanufacturing in response to a 10 percent increase in UBLS. 
In contrast, the GLS estimates using UCPS are in all cases insignificantly 
different  from zero.  The first-differenced  regressions indicate  that  an in- 
crease in  UCPS is associated with higher  sales growth in  manufacturing, 
and  higher  sales  growth  and  lower  employment  growth  in  nonmanu- 
facturing. However, the first-differenced estimates again typically differ in 
both magnitude and direction from either the GLS or the OLS estimates. 
In  an  influential  study,  Brown  and 
Medoff  (1978)  estimate  the  relative  productivity  of  union  and  nonunion 
labor  in  U. S. manufacturing  industries.  Brown  and Medoff  hypothesize 
that  union  labor is more productive because  union  workers are likely to 
receive  more  training, have  more job seniority, and have  higher  morale 
than  are nonunion  workers.  Alternatively,  unions  may  have  a  negative 
effect on productivity because of  the work rules and restrictions they im- 
pose on management. 

Unions  and  labor  productivity. 

Brown  and  Medoff  used  weighted  averages  of  industryhtate  data  to 
estimate a  Cobb-Douglas production function with  capital and an aggre- 
gate labor input: 

ln(Y/L)  = y + aln(Capita1 Stock/Employment) 

+ (p + a - 1)lnL + TU + E ,  

(8) 
where Y is output, K is capital, L is employment, U is the ratio of  union 
employment to total employment, a is the elasticity of  output with respect 
to capital, and p is the elasticity of  output with respect to labor. Brown and 
Medoff’s  estimate  of  T  is  consistent  with  a  22-24  percent  productivity 
differential between union and nonunion establishments?  In this section, 

21  Brown and Medoff estimate equation (4) using cross-state data (there are 29 states or state groups 
in  the  1972 May  CPS)  for  20  two-digit  SIC manufacturing  industries.  Output  data  for  each  state/ 
industry cell are obtained  from the value added data reported in the Census of  Manufactures  (COM). 


The Effects of  Unions on Firm Behavior  /  445 
we  estimate  (4) using  firm-level  data  on  output,  employment,  capital 
stock,  and union  coverage in  our sample over  the  periods  1975-78  and 
1979-82. 

As  an alternative to the restrictive Cobb-Douglas specification, we em- 
ploy a nonparametric method to evaluate the relative productivity of union- 
ized firms.  Specifically, we use the production frontier approach outlined 
in  Fare,  Grosskopf,  and Love11 (1985)  and  Burgess  and  Wilson  (1992). 
First, we establish a nonparametric production frontier for each two-digit 
industry and time period in our sample. Firms with input/output vectors on 
the  production  frontier  are  assigned  a  technical  efficiency  measure  of 
unity. Firms with input/output vectors in the interior of  the production set 
are assigned technical efficiency measures between 0 and 1. The higher the 
measure of technical efficiency, the smaller the distance between the firm’s 
input/output  vector  and the production  frontier. We  then model  a firm’s 
technical efficiency as a function of  its unionization rate and other observ- 
able characteristics. 

Table 6 presents the impact of  an increase in union coverage on a firm’s 
technical  efficiency  based  on  the  nonparametric  production  frontier and 
the Cobb-Douglas production function in equation (4). We include lagged 
values  of  log(Capita1  Stock/Employment),  Capital  Expenditures/Capital 
Stock,  R&D/Sales,  Sales  Growth,  the  logarithm  of  employment,  and 
Four-Firm  Concentration  Ratio  (in  manufacturing)  as additional control 
variables.  We  reject  the  hypothesis  that  6,  is  uncorrelated  with  Xij and 
UBLS,, in one case, and thus present fixed-effects estimates for the Indus- 
try  Effects  specification  of  the  frontier  approach  in  nonmanufacturing 
from 1975-78. 

The results in Table 6 indicate a significant positive impact of  UBLS on 
productivity in manufacturing, using both GLS and first-differenced regres- 
sions,  for  both  the  nonparametric  and  Cobb-Douglas  production  func- 
tions.  In  nonmanufacturing  there  is  evidence  of  a  negative  impact  of 
UBLS  on  productivity  when  using  fixed-  or  random-effects  models.  In 
both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors, the implied union/ 
nonunion productivity differentials are surprisingly similar whether produc- 
tivity is measured relative to the nonparametric or the Cobb-Douglas pro- 
duction function. 

In contrast, industry  average unionization  rates from the  CPS provide 

Brown and Medoff use predicted wages from May CPS data on state-by-industry employment for the 
1973-75  period to weight the “raw” data on the number of employee hours reported in the COM. See 
Brown and Medoff (1978) for a more complete discussion of this weighting procedure. All variables 
are measured per establishment in each statehdustry cell.

The Effects of Unions on Firm Behavior  I  447 
imprecise estimates of  union  productivity effects in  the GLS regressions. 
The  first-differenced  regressions  provide  some  conflicting  evidence  on 
union  productivity  effects  in  nonmanufacturing;  using  the  frontier  ap- 
proach  it  appears  that  an  increase  in  UCPS  reduces  a  firm’s  technical 
efficiency, while the Cobb-Douglas specification implies the opposite. The 
latter results also contrast sharply with the point estimates from either the 
OLS or GLS Cobb-Douglas specifications in nonmanufacturing. 

Conclusion 

In  this  paper  we  analyze  the  impact  of  unions  on  the  behavior  and 
performance  of  firms  using  both  industry-level  and  firm-level  data  on 
union  coverage.  True  within-industry  variation  appears  to  account  for 
more than half the within-industry variation in our firm-level unionization 
rates derived  from BLS contract data. Despite  the  sizable  measurement 
error in our firm-level union coverage ratios, they yield estimates of  union 
effects  that are more precise  and more robust  than are industry  average 
unionization rates based on the CPS. First-differenced regression using the 
BLS unionization  rates rarely yield significant results, suggesting that our 
measured changes in firm-level union coverage may be rather noisy prox- 
ies for the true changes in firm-level union coverage. 

We  find  that  estimated  union  effects  based  on  CPS  industry  average 
unionization rates vary substantially depending on the empirical specifica- 
tion.  GLS and  OLS estimates  are generally  quite  different  from  those 
based on first-differenced regressions using UCPS. In light of  these results, 
estimates  of  union  effects  based  on these  industry-level  data should  be 
viewed  with  some caution.  Comparing  the  GLS  and  OLS  results  using 
UCPS  implies  that, at the  very  least,  random-effects  models  should  be 
estimated in order to avoid seriously overstating the precision of  the coeffi- 
cient estimates. 

The application of firm-level unionization rates to econometric models of 
firm  behavior  leads to a  number  of  interesting  findings  that are broadly 
consistent with the results of  Hirsch (1991a,b, 1992), who also utilizes firm- 
level union data. Unions appear to have a strong negative effect on profit- 
ability  in  both  manufacturing  and  nonmanufacturing.  Much  of  the  esti- 
mated effect of unionization on profits works indirectly through changes in 
investment or growth. There is also strong evidence that higher union cover- 
age significantly reduces current investment, though this effect is less pre- 
cisely estimated when several controls are included. In addition, the results 
indicate that more heavily unionized firms are more capital intensive. Em- 
ployment growth in unionized firms is lower in manufacturing and nonmanu- 


448  /  STEPHEN G. BRONARS, DONALD R. DEERE, AND JOSEPH S. TRACY 
facturing, but sales growth is significantly reduced by unionization  only in 
nonmanufacturing. Unions are associated with higher relative productivity 
levels in manufacturing and lower productivity in  nonmanufacturing,  re- 
gardless of  the methodology used to measure productivity. 

Appendix 

In this appendix we briefly summarize how BLS contract data are used 
to  generate  union  employment  by  firm/year  and  how  these  data  are 
merged  with  the  Compustat  database  to calculate unionization  rates  for 
each firm and year in the sample. Each contract in the BLS file includes an 
identification  number that is unique to the bargaining unit (defined by the 
firm(s) and union(s) signing the contract). This gives a panel structure to 
the data and allows us to follow a bargaining unit through each successive 
contract. For any given contract, we know the firm(s)  and union(s) in the 
bargaining  unit,  the  number  of  workers in  the  bargaining  unit  as of  the 
effective  date of  the contract,  the three-digit  industry  SIC code for  the 
major product line associated with the bargaining unit, the state or region 
where the bargaining unit  is located,  and the planned expiration date of 
the contract. 

The first task  is  to generate  an employment  chronology listing the ex- 
pected  number of  workers in each bargaining unit  for each month  in  the 
sample  period.  The  BLS  contract  data  reports  the  number  of  workers 
covered  by  each  bargaining  agreement,  and  thus  contains  snapshots  of 
employment levels at each negotiation of  a new contract. Care is taken by 
the BLS to measure as best as possible the number of  permanent workers 
in  the bargaining  unit.  Part-time workers  are recorded  as the number  of 
full-time equivalent workers, and workers on layoff are included if the firm 
perceives a high chance of  recall. We generate a time series of  employment 
for each  bargaining  unit  by  linearly  interpolating  employment  observa- 
tions  between  successive  contracts.  The  employment  level  for  the  last 
contract in the panel is assumed to be constant for the expected duration of 
the contract. 

For each uniodfirm bargaining pair, we sum employment levels in each 
month  across all bargaining units involving  the uniodfirm  pair.  We  then 
calculate annual averages of  these union/firm monthly employment tools. 
To  obtain the overall union employment at a firm in a given year, we sum 
across the annual averages of  union employment  for all unions that bar- 
gained with the firm in that year. 

It  should  be  noted  that  multiemployer  bargaining  units  are excluded 
from the calculations above.  Our firm-specific union  coverage  measures 


The Effects of  Unions on Firm Behavior  I  449 
only include workers covered by union contracts with  a single employer. 
For multiemployer bargaining units,  the BLS only reports the total num- 
ber  of  workers covered  across all employers in  the  bargaining  unit.  The 
contract  data do not  specify employment per firm, nor  do they  typically 
identify the firms comprising the bargaining unit. It is worth noting, how- 
ever, that a large majority of multiemployer agreements are in the construc- 
tion, retail/wholesale trade, and service industries. Less than 10 percent of 
the firms in our sample are in these industries and the inclusion of  industry 
fixed-effects should help to reduce this source of  measurement error. 

The approach  outlined  above  allows  us  to  construct  a  time  series  of 
unionized  employment  for  each  firm  in  the  BLS  data  set.  In  order  to 
construct  a  measure  of  a  firm’s unionization  rate, i.e., the  fraction  of  a 
firm’s  total  employment  covered  by  a  union  contract,  we  must  obtain 
measures of  total  employment for the firms in our sample. We  therefore 
match the names of  the companies in the BLS contract file to Compustat 
data  for publicly  traded  firms.  The Compustat  data  are compilations  of 
information  in  firms’  annual  reports,  10K  reports,  and  other  financial 
statements, and include a firm’s total employment, measured  as the total 
number of  workers on payroll at the end of  the fiscal year. Name-by-name 
matching of  the BLS contract and Compustat data sets results in a sample 
of  653 firms. A number of  firms were deleted because of  missing values for 
employment  on the  Compustat  tape, or because  the firms had  been dis- 
solved, had been acquired by other firms, or were too young to have any 
data for  the  1971-82  period.  This  left  560  firms  for  which  an  average 
unionization rate can be calculated for at least one of  the periods 1975-78 
or 1979-82. 

As noted above, the union employment series generated from the BLS 
contract  file  is  a  smoothed time  series; bargaining  units  are assumed  to 
expand or contract according to a linear time trend across contract dates. 
In order to take account of  this smoothing and the lack of a cyclical pattern 
in the union employment data, we construct unionization rates as the ratio 
of  average bargaining  unit  employment to average firm  employment  for 
each  of  the  1975-78  and  1979-82  periods.  We  also  adjusted  a  firm’s 
unionization rate to account for bargaining units of  less than 1,000 workers 
that  were  not  present  in  our main  data  by  definition.  We  were  able  to 
obtain from the BLS a listing of  contracts for all sizes of  bargaining units 
for the year 1974. This listing is referred to by the BLS as the Alpha List of 
Key and Non-Key Contracts. (Note that for this year about 85 percent of 
workers were in  bargaining  units  of  1,000 or more  workers.)  Using  this 
listing we calculated the fraction of  a firm’s covered workers that were in 
large  bargaining  units  (1,000  or  more).  We  then  multiplied  the  firm’s 


450  /  STEPHEN G. BRONARS, DONALD R. DEERE, AND JOSEPH S. TRACY 
“large-contract” unionization  rate (described above) by the reciprocal  of 
this fraction to get a final unionization rate for each firmhime period. 

Our sample is  comprised  of  only  large  publicly  traded  firms  that  had 
some  unionized  workers.  Thus the  union  effects  noted  in  the  paper  are 
conditional  on a firm having a nonzero unionization rate. Although these 
large firms are not  a random  sample of  the population  of  employers, we 
focus on them  for two reasons.  First, union  coverage  and total  employ- 
ment  data  are  generally  only  available  for  large  collectively  bargained 
contracts and publicly traded firms. Second, almost all of the recent empiri- 
cal work  on the impact of  unionization  on firm  behavior  has  focused on 
large  publicly  traded  firms,  because  measures  of  firm  performance  and 
behavior  (e.g., profits,  market  value,  investment,  and  employment)  are 
typically only available for these firms.
