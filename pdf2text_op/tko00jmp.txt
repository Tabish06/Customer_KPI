Abstract Examines the Japanese management philosophy in organizations, and develops a 15-
item, four-factor (family orientation and loyalty, open communication, team approach, and
manager knowledge) Japanese organizational culture scale (JOCS). Investigates the differences in
JOCS and other work-related variables between 156 non-unionized employees of one Japanese-
owned automobile plant and 144 unionized employees of one US-owned automobile plant in the
USA. There were no differences in income and education. Employees in the Japanese-owned plant
had higher scores for family orientation and loyalty, open communication, team approach,
manager knowledge, organizational commitment, organization-based self-esteem, organizational
instrumentality, intrinsic satisfaction, and extrinsic satisfaction than those in the US-owned
plant. Results are discussed in light of organizational culture and enhancing quality and
productivity in the global competitive market.

Henry Ford began production of the original Model A in 1903. By the spring of
1914, Ford was actually turning out two products at his Highland Park factory:
Model Ts and a continuous stream of enlightened industrial pilgrims. In the
early 1980s, a new pilgrimage route emerged, with the destination now being
Japan instead of Detroit. Just as Henry Ford’s mass production methods
diffused throughout the world in the early part of this century, the Japanese
production method (lean production) and management philosophy have begun
to diffuse (Davenport and Tang, 1996; Rhody and Tang, 1995; Womack et al.,
1990). This diffusion is occurring in two ways: The Japanese are building
plants in the USA, and the US mass-producers are adopting these methods on
their own.

Honda made the Japanese automobile industry’s first serious foreign
investment with its Marysville, Ohio, complex that began assembly in 1982.
Nissan, Toyota and Mazda soon followed. A total of 11 Japanese transplants and

joint ventures between Japanese and US manufacturers have been in operation.
Today, many US citizens are working for Japanese-owned companies in the
USA. These Japanese transplants assemble 1.4 million cars annually on the US
mainland. This will account for slightly more than 20 percent of automobile
assemblies in North America by the end of the decade (Womack et al., 1990).

The major purpose of this study is to develop the Japanese organizational culture
scale (JOCS) based on theory and research suggested in the literature. We will
examine the factor structures, reliability, and the nomological network (construct
validity) of JOCS, and differences in JOCS and other work-related variables between
employees of the Japanese-owned and the US-owned automobile plants in the USA.
In the following paragraphs, the concept of organizational culture and the major
variables related to Japanese management style will be reviewed.

Organizational culture
The concept of organizational culture has its roots in cultural anthropology and
was alluded to as early as the Hawthorne Studies in the 1920s. Many
definitions of organizational culture have been proposed in the literature, but
the common underlying theme of these definitions is based on an organization’s
underlying values, beliefs, and their shared philosophy (Barney, 1986; Corbett,
1986; Deal and Kennedy, 1982; Ouchi, 1981; Pettigrew, 1979; Schein, 1990; 1996;
Shockley-Zalabak and Morley, 1989).

Schein (1990) suggested that organizational culture has three levels:
(1) artifacts (e.g. personal enactment, ceremonies and rites, stories, rituals,

and symbols);

(2) values (i.e. consciously articulated beliefs); and
(3) basic underlying assumptions (i.e. the deepest, unconscious, and most

fundamental beliefs).

Further, culture is defined as:

. . . the pattern of basic assumptions that the group has invented, discovered, or developed in
learning to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration (Schein,
1986, p. 30).

Culture also influences how the members of the group understand and respond
to their environment (Schein, 1996). In the early 1980s, many researchers and
scholars have tried to use the concept of culture to explain why US companies
do not perform as well as their Japanese counterparts (Deal and Kennedy, 1982;
Ouchi, 1981; Pascale and Athos, 1981; Peters and Waterman, 1982). Tang et al.
(1987; 1989; 1991; 1993) found that quality circle members will develop different
work-related behaviors and performances due to different types of ‘‘business
environment, values’’, and ‘‘culture’’ in the organization (see Deal and Kennedy,
1982; Schein, 1986).

There are many different measures of organizational culture, including (to

name but a few):

the organizational beliefs questionnaire (OBQ) developed by Sashkin
(1984);
the corporate culture survey (CCS) by Glaser (1983);
the organizational culture inventory (OCI) by Cooke and Lafferty (1989);
the culture gap survey (CGS) by Kilman and Saxton (1983).

Recently, Xenikou and Furnham (1996) examined the factor structure of the 30
subscales of these four measures of organizational culture (i.e. OCI, CGS, OBQ,
and CCS) and identified five factors of organizational culture:

Japanese

task-oriented organizational growth;
the human factor in a bureaucratic culture;

(1) openness to change in a cooperative culture;
(2)
(3)
(4) negativism and resistance to new ideas; and
(5) positive social relations in the workplace.

Cooke and Rousseau (1988) believed that the OCI, an instrument designed for
both cross-sectional organizational research and data-based cultural change
programs, profiles the culture of organizations in terms of behavioral norms
and expectations. They believe that
is possible to measure culture
quantitatively with respect to these norms and expectations. We assert that
these culture-related inventories and measures in the literature (e.g. Cooke and
Rousseau, 1988; Xenikou and Furnham, 1996) do not tap on the Japanese
management philosophy in organizations, the focus of the present study.

it

Culture is the bedrock of an organization. Even if a company does not
deliberately and consciously indoctrinate its new employees, its important
beliefs, values, and ways of doing things will, in any case, powerfully socialize
anyone who remains in the organization. Organizational culture can be a source
of sustained competitive advantage. Firms with strong cultures are pointed out
as examples of strong management.

Benchmarking, the mechanism for modifying the cultures of other firms to
approximate closely the cultures of successful firms, has been widely discussed
and applied. Benchmarking became a commonly-used TQM technique only
recently. Xerox is generally credited with the first use of benchmarking by a US
company. In 1979, a team of Xerox line managers went to Japan to study the
productivity of Japanese photocopier manufacturers. The Xerox team found
that Japanese companies could build higher-quality machines for substantially
less than Xerox. These efforts are seen not only as ways of improving employee
morale and quality of work life, but also vital for improving a firm’s financial
performance (Barney, 1986). Now many other companies are following suit in
pursuing benchmarking as a means of enhancing quality and productivity
(Main, 1992).

World trade today is moving toward the triad market with three regional

competition, there is a growing need to manage human resources effectively
across borders (Tang et al., 2000). We trust that our understanding of Japanese
organizational culture will help researchers and managers manage quality and
productivity effectively and efficiently in the global market.

With so many US employees working for Japanese companies in today’s
society, culture is an important variable to study. Very little research has
investigated organizational culture relating to the Japanese management
philosophy and examined the differences of these shared cultural beliefs and
values between Japanese transplant and traditional US-owned plant. This study
aims to fill the void.

Japanese management philosophy
The Japanese management philosophy is a direct outgrowth of their culture.
This Japanese philosophy is evident in several basic principles in which they
believe: trust employees, build employee loyalty to the company, invest in
training, treat employees as resources, recognize employee accomplishments,
decentralize decision making, and employ consensual decision making (Cole,
1980; Harper, 1988; Johnson and Ouchi, 1974). In fact, the Japanese have taken
many of these basic ideas developed in the US behavioral sciences and acted to
institutionalize them in daily practice (Cole, 1980). This may be possible due to
the high level of consistency between the Japanese culture and the way
corporations operate. The key concepts will be discussed below.

Family orientation and loyalty
The USA is considered as an individualistic Western society characterized by
an emphasis on individual identity, individual goals, and individual welfare
(Hofstede, 1983; Triandis et al., 1985). On the other hand, Japan generally
represents a collectivist culture that emphasizes membership within groups or
communities and considers group welfare over one’s own individual welfare.
Employees in Japanese companies will have a strong sense of loyalty and
dedication to the organization.

The Japanese have a very people-oriented way of viewing their employees.
They have concerns for the total individual and view each worker as a person
rather than an employee (Bowman, 1984; Harper, 1988; Hatvany and Pucik,
1981; Johnson and Ouchi, 1974). Active, observable concern for each and every
employee is expressed by supervisory personnel (Clark, 1979; Rohlen, 1974).

(harmony)

Many chief executives of major Japanese companies frequently describe the
firm as a ‘‘family’’ (Hatvany and Pucik, 1981). Among the norms of family life,

philosophy. The commitment of the ‘‘family’’ to the employee is expressed in
company policies of avoiding layoffs and providing the employee with a wide
range of supplementary benefits.

is the most often emphasized component

In a personal interview, Joe Kieltyka (1991), a top executive for a Japanese-
owned manufacturing plant in the USA and a former 20-year executive of a
major US-managed plant, explained that the Japanese philosophy dictates that


Japanese
organizational
culture

539

managers think of their organization as family. In a Japanese-owned company,
managers always listen to employees’ problems and concerns, both work-
related and personal.

The Japanese have introduced into the work environment a sense of
community. At Toyota, for example, they have a day-care center for young
mothers who wish to work. Out of 6,000 employees at Toyota, roughly 5,900 of
them are US citizens. Most of them are from Kentucky (Aaron, 1996). This
sense of community tends to foster togetherness or rather a sense of fate: what
happens to one will happen to all.

A recent example will further illustrate this point. In 1998, there was a slow-
down in the sales of the small car market. For Nissan, in Smyrna, Tennessee,
there was no exception. In the early summer of 1998, Nissan did not lay off any
employees in response to the softened small car market. Instead, Nissan
initiated the four-day work week program. During this time period, employees
on the assembly line worked 32 hours (four days) per week and were paid 36
hours per week, while management and maintenance workers continued to
work 40 hours per week. At the same time, Nissan instituted training programs
for employees in new jobs and utilized the human resources effectively to meet
the market conditions. Further, most employees enjoyed the three-day weekend
for the whole summer and were quite happy. With the flexibility in a union-free
environment, Nissan has created a win-win situation for all (Laws and Tang,
1999).

In contrast, also in 1998, 9,200 GM workers of two parts plants in Flint,
Michigan, started the strike on June 5 and June 11, respectively. Owing to the
parts’ shortage, GM and other parts plants laid off about 200,000 workers in
almost all GM plants in North America. This strike cost GM about US$80
million per day. At the end of the second quarter, in 1998, GM lost US$2 billion.
It is possible that the strike caused GM to lose money and further slow down its
ability to improve efficiency and effectiveness in order to compete against other
auto makers in the USA and around the world (Laws and Tang, 1999).

As has been suggested in the literature, rarely, if ever, do workers vote for
unions. Rather, they cast votes against management. The first line supervisors
are the best union organizers. With a strong organizational culture, Japanese
transplants worldwide tend to create a better working environment for their
employees, thus eliminating the need for a strong union.

Open communication and consensual decision making
Japanese companies emphasize team spirit in work groups. Further, due to
employees’ long tenure in the organization and the network of friendships,
employees tend to have extensive face-to-face communication in the work
setting. Job rotation also may stimulate the emergence of informal lateral
communication network.

In the consensual decision-making process, the manager will not decide until
others who will be affected have had sufficient time to offer their views, feel
they have been fairly heard, and are willing to support the decision even

though they may not feel that it is the best one. Managers are open to all
questions (Kieltyka, 1991). Managers are ‘‘open’’ and tend to have a high level of
trust and to involve their people (Schein, 1981, p. 59). Recently, the notion of
trust has received a lot of attention in the literature (Gilbert and Tang, 1998;
Sitkin et al., 1998).

Further, their ‘‘consensus decision making’’ and ‘‘bottom-up communication’’
are also noteworthy for Japan’s success. ‘‘In a strong culture, people want to feel
involved in their organizations and they need to know their input is valued’’
(Corbett, 1986, p. 74). Further, ‘‘managers encourage people to speak up when
they disagree with a decision and inform all employees of what is happening in
other parts of the organization’’ (Corbett, 1986, p. 72). This notion is strongly
related to the team approach in organizations.

The team approach
The Japanese also ‘‘encourage and place responsibility on groups rather than
on individuals’’ and emphasize a team goal (Ouchi, 1981). Thus, the Japanese-
owned company have a significantly stronger emphasis on the use of teams
than the US-owned company (Tang and Crofford, 1995/1996).

Because of Japan’s team-orientation, moreover, there are fewer factors that
make distinctions between management and employees at the Japanese-
managed company than at the US-managed company. At the Japanese-owned
company, they do not have executive dining rooms, reserved parking spaces,
etc. Employees all wear the same uniforms from the president to the line
workers. Further, there is less of an adversarial (we vs they, or employee vs
management) relationship in the Japanese-managed company.

Manager knowledge
In the area of human resource, many large Japanese companies have practiced
lifetime employment in the past (Hatvany and Pucik, 1981). Under conditions of
lifetime employment, job rotation and slow promotion are used extensively
unless an organization is expanding dramatically. As a consequence, managers
do not have the specialization of careers. They are very knowledgeable
concerning the operations of the whole organization and have more empathy
and understanding for other functions.

Further, as we discussed earlier, due to long tenure and the network of
friendships, managers and their subordinates develop long-term relationships
and a culture in which everyone knows his or her place in the status hierarchy in
Japan. The manager is automatically more of a ‘‘mentor’’, teaching employees
through subtle cues, exercising great patience, and reinforcing the basic company
philosophy as a conceptual source that helps subordinates decide what to do in
any given situation. Managers are easily available to provide help to employees.

In this study, we developed items based on the present review of the

literature that tapped on the following four dimensions:

family orientation and loyalty;

(1)
(2) open communication;


Japanese
organizational
culture

541

(3)
team approach; and
(4) manager knowledge.

These dimensions have ‘‘not’’ been examined extensively in the organizational
culture literature (e.g. Cooke and Lafferty, 1989; Cooke and Rousseau, 1988;
Glaser, 1983; Kilman and Saxton, 1983; Sashkin, 1984; Xenikou and Furnham,
1996). Many studies in the literature have examined the cross-cultural
differences in work-related attitudes and values in several countries (Abramson
et al., 1993; Beechler and Yang, 1994; Cox and Cooper, 1985; Hofstede, 1983;
Mullen, 1995; Singh, 1995; Ralston et al., 1993; Riordan and Vandenberg, 1994).
First, the present authors argue that, although the employees at these two
automobile plants are all US workers in the USA, it is expected that there will
be some significant differences in the JOCS due to the cultural differences in the
Japanese-owned and the US-owned plants. Second, besides focusing on the
mean differences, the present authors will further examine two types of
equivalence (conceptual as well as true-score equivalence). In the field of
organizational behavior, researchers transform an unobservable phenomenon
(i.e. psychological constructs such as Japanese management philosophy,
organizational culture) into an observable reality. Constructs of the survey
instrument are measured by imperfect indicators. The structural equation
modeling (SEM) approach deals with the relationships of underlying latent
traits instead of observed variables which contain measurement errors. Many
of
these variables may be highly related, causing problems related to
collinearity. This method directly tests assumptions of conceptual and true-
score equivalency. The following hypotheses will be tested:
H1. There will be significant mean differences regarding the JOCS between
employees of the Japanese-owned and the US-owned automobile plants
in the USA. More specifically, employees of
the Japanese-owned
automobile plant will have significantly higher scores on the JOCS than
employees of the US-owned automobile plants.

H2. There will be differences in covariance matrices regarding the JOCS
Japanese-owned and the US-owned

the
between employees of
automobile plants in the USA.

H3. There will be differences in factor loadings regarding the JOCS between
employees of the Japanese-owned and the US-owned automobile plants
in the USA.

Other work-related variables
In the literature, employee commitment has been investigated by many
scholars (e.g. Mowday et al., 1982) and is generally viewed as a positive factor
for both individuals and organizations (Romzek, 1989). Further, Japanese
workers in large organizations have enjoyed their life-time employment and
tend to have a high level of commitment to organizations (Davenport and Tang,
1996; Rhody and Tang, 1995).

Pierce et al. (1989, p. 625) defined organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) as:

. . . the degree to which organizational members believe that they can satisfy their needs by
participating in roles within the context of an organization . . . As a result, employees with
high OBSE should perceive themselves as important, meaningful, effectual, and worthwhile
within their employing organization.

Tang and Ibrahim (1998) found that OBSE is the most significant variable
related to organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) for employees in the USA
and in the Middle East.

According to Singer and Tang (1996), organizational instrumentality (OI) is
analogous to union instrumentality and refers to an employee’s perception of
the organization’s effectiveness in securing valent outcomes for him or her. OI
can be defined as:

. . . employees’ beliefs and confidence (expectancy) that the organization will be instrumental
in helping employees achieve their major personal goals in the organization (Singer and
Tang, 1996, p. 273).

Singer and Tang (1996) found that employees with high job security will have
high confidence in the organization’s OI and may be less likely to vote for a
union. Finally, numerous studies of job satisfaction have appeared in the
literature of organizational behavior. Further, the Minnesota Satisfaction
Questionnaire is one of the most often used measures of intrinsic and extrinsic
job satisfaction (Weiss et al., 1967).

The present authors assert that the constructs measured by the JOCS will be
significantly correlated with employee commitment (Romzek, 1989), OBSE
(Pierce et al., 1989), OI (Singer and Tang, 1996), and also intrinsic and extrinsic
job satisfaction (Weiss et al., 1967). These correlation coefficients may also
serve as the construct validity of the JOCS. It is reasonable to expect that those
who work in the Japanese-owned automobile plant will score higher on these
measures than those in the US-owned automobile plant.

Method
Participants
The participants of
this study were volunteers from two automobile
manufacturing plants: one was a Japanese-owned manufacturing plant and the
other was a similar US-owned manufacturing plant in the USA. Employees in
the US-owned plant are unionized and represented by the UAW, whereas those
in the Japanese-owned plant are not. Participants were approximately 50
percent white-collar and 50 percent blue-collar workers from each plant.

For the Japanese-owned plant, 173 workers were randomly selected for the
survey and 156 of them returned usable responses. The response rate was 90
percent. For the US-owned plant, 167 employees were randomly surveyed and
144 completed forms were collected, giving an 86 percent response rate.

Measures
A research questionnaire was developed specifically for the present study.
These employee’s participation in this study was completely voluntary and their
confidentiality was protected by answering the questionnaire anonymously.
Participants’ age, sex (dummy coding: male = 0; female = 1), education level (in
years), job tenure (in years), and self-reported income were obtained.

The response format for the attitudinal measures was a five-point Likert
scale using disagree strongly (1), neutral (3), and agree strongly (5) as anchors.
The 29-item JOCS was developed by the present authors based on suggestions
in the literature. Further, several work-related variables were also included:

.

.

.

.

the 11-item organizational involvement sale (Romzek, 1989);
the ten-item OBSE (Pierce et al., 1989);
the 13-item OI (Singer and Tang, 1996); and
the 20-item Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (Weiss et al., 1967).

The Cronbach’s alpha for each of these variables in the present study is
presented in Table I.

Results
Table I presents the mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients of all
variables for the whole sample. Further, Table II shows the means of major
variables for the Japanese-owned plant and the US-owned plant. In our data
analyses, we will present the results of the exploratory factor analysis of the
JOCS and the tests of measurement equivalence in four phases (Tables III-V).
Then, we will examine internal reliability, and validity of the JOCS and also the
differences of the JOCS and other work-related variables using a multivariate
analysis of variance (MANOVA) (Table II).

Phase 1. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA)
First of all, the 29-item scale was analyzed using a series of EFAs. The
exploratory factor analyses were conducted separately for participants in the
Japanese transplant and for those in the US-owned plant. Factor analyses were
conducted using a criterion of eigenvalues greater than one, followed by the
varimax rotation, and a scree-test. Items loaded very strongly and consistently
on specific factors in both samples were retained. Based on these procedures, 15
items were selected for the final JOCS (see Table III).

Table II.
Mean of major
variables for employees
at US-owned and
Japanese-owned
automobile plants

Results of exploratory factor analyses showed that there were four factors for
both the Japanese-owned and the US-owned plants (Table IV). Factor 1
revealed family orientation and loyalty. This factor had five items. Factor 2
focused on open communication among employees (four items). Factor 3
suggested the team approach (three items). Finally, Factor 4 suggested
manager knowledge in the work setting (three items). The inter-factor
correlations among these four factors and the Cronbach’s alpha for each factor
and for the whole scale are also presented in Table IV.

Phase 2. Mean differences (MANOVA)
The results of the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), based on the
15-item scale, showed that there was a significant overall difference between
employees at
the Japanese-owned and the US-owned plants in JOCS
(F (15, 281) = 11.02, p < 0.001, Wilks’ Lambda = 0.630). The amount of variance
explained was 37 percent. Further univariate F-tests showed that
the
differences came from 14 of the 15 items. The mean, standard deviation,
F-value, and the items of the JOCS are presented in Table III.

The differences are all in the predicted direction. For example, employees at
the Japanese-owned automobile plant had indicated a significantly stronger
feeling that their company tries to create a unique ‘‘family’’ atmosphere (Item 1)
and their company emphasized strong loyalty and dedication (Item 2) than
those at the US-owned plant. Thus, employees in these two samples do feel
differently regarding the culture in their organization. These significant mean
differences supported H1.

Further, there are two major issues when we examine the general concern for

full measurement equivalence in several populations:

the comparability of constructs; and
the calibration of true scores.

First, it is plausible that members of distinct groups (i.e. employees at the
Japanese transplant and the traditional US-owned plant) do not use a common
frame of reference when responding to the items of a given instrument. Second,
true-score equivalence among groups deals with whether respondents calibrate
the intervals anchoring the measurement continuum in the same manner. A
covariance structure analytic approach was employed in Phases 3 and 4 to test
the conceptual as well as true-score equivalence.

Phase 3. Equivalence of the variance/covariance matrices
Phase 3 tested the null hypothesis that employees at the Japanese transplant (J)
and the traditional US-owned plant (A) have equal variance-covariance matrices:

Ho:

The variance-covariance matrices of the 15-item JOCS were calculated for both
the participants at the Japanese transplant and those at the US-owned plant. The
results showed that the variance-covariance matrices among the two groups
were different regarding the JOCS, chi-square (120, n = 329) = 283.70, p < 0.05.
Since the chi-square test was omnibus in nature and was significant, the next
step is to identify the source of possible nonequivalence using a series of
increasing restrictive hypotheses. H2 was supported.

Phase 4. Equivalence of factor loadings
Phase 4 examines the equivalence of factor loadings by placing equality constraints
on the factor loadings across the two groups. The true score equivalence was


Japanese
organizational
culture

549

determined by comparing the two samples on the true-score units associated with
each observed item of the JOCS. The null hypothesis of this more restrictive model
tested here was that there was equivalence of factor loadings across two groups:

Ho: (cid:3)J (cid:136) (cid:3)A

We examined the factor loading, standard error and t-value of parameter estimates
for testing equivalence of factor loadings across two groups. Results for the two
samples revealed that the equivalence of factor loadings was not supported, chi-
square (183, n = 329) = 372.908, p < 0.001. This means that the factor loadings for
these two groups are different.

Table V shows the results of the cumulative multivariate statistics. In
cumulative Step 1, Item 7’s factor loading on Factor 2 for the Japanese sample
was marginally different from that of the US sample, chi-square (1, n = 329) =
3.691, p = 0.055 (see the lower part of Table V, Step 1). In Step 2, two items
(Items 7 and 6) were combined in that the factor loading of Item 6 in the
Japanese sample was significantly different from that of the US sample, chi-
square (2, n = 329) = 6.513, p = 0.039. Similar results were also reported in
Table V following the same format for Steps 3-8. Table V shows that the factor
loadings for the following cumulative items were also significantly different
from these two groups of employees: Items 9, 4, 2, 5, 10, and 13. The results of
Step 9 show that the difference was not significant. H3 was supported.

Reliability and validity
Cronbach’s alpha values for the four factors of the JOCS using the whole
sample are listed below:

family orientation and loyalty (0.87);

(1)
(2) open communication (0.88);
(3)
team approach (0.78); and
(4) manager knowledge (0.80).

Cronbach’s alpha for the 15-item scale using the whole sample was 0.92.
Further, the alphas of the 15-item scale for the Japanese transplant sample was
0.92 and for the US-owned plant sample was 0.90. Table IV also presents the
reliability alpha for each of the four factors in these two samples. Thus, the
internal consistency of the JOCS was quite good.

Table I also shows all the correlation coefficients between the four factors of
the JOCS, the overall 15-item JOCS (i.e. the average score of all 15 items), and
other work-related variables. Family orientation and loyalty,
open
communication, team approach, and manager knowledge were significantly
correlated with commitment, OBSE, OI, and intrinsic and extrinsic job
satisfaction (p < 0.05). These factors were also significantly correlated with age
and tenure. Table II shows the differences of the two samples regarding these
two variables. These results offer some preliminary construct validity of the
JOCS.

US-owned vs Japanese-owned
All demographic variables, the four factors of the JOCS, and work-related
variables were analyzed in a MANOVA using the Japanese-owned automobile
plant and the USA-owned automobile plant as the independent variable (see
Table II). Results showed that there were significant differences in these
variables between these two groups of employees (F (14, 257) = 22.22, Wilks’
Lambda = 0.452, p = 0.000). Further univariate F-tests showed that the
differences were related to the following variables:

. age;

.

.

tenure;
family orientation and loyalty;

. open communication;

.

team approach;

. manager knowledge;
. commitment;
. OBSE;
. OI;

.

intrinsic job satisfaction; and

. extrinsic satisfaction.

The overall 15-item JOCS scores were not included in the MANOVA. Our
ANOVA results suggested that employees in the Japanese-owned plant scored
higher (3.92) on JOCS than did those in the US-owned plant (3.32) (F (1, 295) =
53.92, p = 0.000). Significant results were again found in all attitudinal
variables in analyses of co-variance (ANCOVA) holding age and job tenure as

In this study, we specifically designed a survey to tap the Japanese
management philosophy. The present investigation identifies four factors for
the JOCS: family orientation and loyalty; open communication; team approach;
and manager knowledge. Employees at the Japanese-owned automobile plant
and those at the US-owned plant differ in 14 items of the 15-item JOCS. Further,
the different variance-covariance matrices in these two groups reveal that the
structures of relationships among variables between two groups are different
in general terms. The factor loadings of JOCS are different for these two
samples that reflect the differences between two groups regarding specific
structure of relationships among variables and the true score equivalence.

Our research shows that the JOCS has good internal reliability. Thus, items
within each factor are measuring a consistent construct. The correlation
coefficients among the four factors of the JOCS are quite high, which suggests
that the four factors are not completely orthogonal or independent of each

other. A close examination of the whole 15-item JOCS suggests that the
Cronbach’s alphas for the whole sample, the Japanese plant sample, and the US
plant sample, are all very high: 0.92, 0.92, and 0.90, respectively. It is plausible
that the whole 15-item scale is measuring a very homogeneous construct and
all 15 items can be used as one scale. Further, this scale is related to many
existing and important work-related variables (i.e. commitment, OBSE, OI, and
intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction) offering some support for the construct
validity of this scale.

It is also interesting to note that all participants in this study were US
workers working on similar jobs. Owing to the fact that these US workers have
been exposed to different company policies, management styles, leadership
behaviors, and organizational cultures, they responded to the same survey
questionnaire differently. Our
specific
constructs of the Japanese culture. Our results show that the JOCS may be
appropriate for employees at
the Japanese-owned company. However,
employees at the US-owned company may have a different set of perceptions
regarding the constructs of the scale. Thereby, these two groups of employees’
response patterns on JOCS are not perfectly identical.

survey questionnaire measures

Our results further suggest that employees in these two automobile plants
have similar self-reported income, education, and gender composition. The
nature of their job duties and responsibilities is about the same. Employees in
the Japanese-owned plant have a significantly higher level of commitment to
the organization, higher perceptions about themselves as valuable employees
in the organization (OBSE), greater confidence in the organization in achieving
their personal goals (OI), as well as greater intrinsic and extrinsic job
satisfaction than their counterparts in the US-owned automobile plant. These
findings offer some verification of the fact that the Japanese-owned plant is ‘‘not
unionized’’ and the US-owned plant is. We do not manipulate the culture in
these two organizations. Therefore, no cause-and-effect relationship can be
stated regarding culture and other work-related attitudes and values. However,
the Japanese philosophy (trust employees, build employee loyalty to the
company,
invest in training and treat employees as resources, recognize
employee accomplishments, decentralize decision making, and employ
consensual decision making) may play an important role in organizations (Cole,
1980; Davenport and Tang, 1996; Harper, 1988; Johnson and Ouchi, 1974; Laws
and Tang, 1999; Rhody and Tang, 1995).

As we pointed out earlier, the UPS strike in 1997, the GM strikes in 1996
and 1998, were very costly to organizations. Through the GM strike in 1998,
GM lost US$2 billion. This may happen to any organizations in the USA or
around the world. It is clear that organizational culture can be a source of
sustained competitive advantage. Corporations with strong organizational
cultures have strong management that may be related not only to employee
morale and quality of work life, but also to a firm’s financial performance
(Barney, 1986).

On the basis of the attitude-behavior consistency literature (Ajzen and
Fishbein, 1977; Tang and Baumeister, 1984), we argue that attitudes will
predict behavior effectively only when there is high correspondence between
the attitude object and the behavioral option. This study offers a new measure
for researchers and managers in organizational behavior and human resources.
It should be pointed out that we have only collected data from employees in one
Japanese-owned and one US-owned automobile plant using the survey method.
In this study, our unit of analysis is the individual employees.

the most

Moreover, similarity is one of

important determinants of
interpersonal attraction. The attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) model
suggests that employees with some specific values, attitudes, and backgrounds
may be attracted to, selected by, and will remain with, organizations that have
organizational goals and culture to their liking. They prefer to work for either
the Japanese-owned automobile plant or the US-owned plant. Therefore, the
good fit between the employees and the organization (ASA), employee
membership, and turnover in the organization need to be examined further
(Chatman, 1989; Tang and Frost, 1999; Tang et al., 2000).

Conclusions
In this study, we developed a 15-item JOCS. This scale has four factors: family
orientation and loyalty; open communication; team approach; and manager
knowledge. This scale measures a very homogeneous construct and has good
reliability. This scale is also related to many existing and important work-
related variables and offers strong construct validity. Employees in the
Japanese-owned plant scored higher on this scale than did those in the US-
owned plant. We have faith in the JOCS as a valuable tool to tap on the Japanese
management philosophy. It is also relatively short and easy to use. Researchers
and managers may want to consider this valuable scale for future research,
especially in pursuing benchmarking as a means of enhancing quality and
productivity in the global competitive market (Main, 1992) and in keeping the
facility union-free (Laws and Tang, 1999).

Limitations
It is also very difficult to separate the issue of the Japanese-owned plant vs the
US-owned plant from the issue of non-unionized plant vs unionized plant.
Managers and employees’ attitudes and behavior may be profoundly
influenced by the presence of the union. Owing to limitations set by the
management, we were unable to further explore issues related to the union and
other measures of organizational culture in the present study. Future
researchers may want to expand the nomological network (i.e. construct
validity) of the JOCS by examining other work-related attitudinal variables and
outcome variables, such as money attitudes (Tang, 1992; 1993), voluntary
turnover, and voting behavior in union certification election and replicate the
present findings in several Japanese-owned and US-owned organizations in
different industries to verify the generalizability of the present findings.

Should Western managers be encouraged to adopt JMPs ?(Japanese
management practices)
Naylor, D.M.
Employee Relations (UK), 2000 Vol 22 No 2: p. 160 (19 pages)

Reviews the literature, since the 1970s, which has looked at whether Western
managers should adopt Japanese management practices. Discusses the factors
that indicate that the transfer of Japanese management practices may not be
straightforward, pointing to differences in Western and Japanese corporate
governance and in supplier
relations. Reviews the literature on the
transferability of those Japanese management practices which have created
most interest among Western companies, dividing these according to whether
they relate to personnel (teamworking and quality circles) or manufacturing
(cellular manufacture and just-in-time). Concludes that the evidence overall
seems to indicate that Japanese management practices can be adopted by
Western companies, but warns against blindly copying these practices without
analysing the reasons for their success and assessing their appropriateness.
Considers if the convergence between managerial practices in Japan and the
West will make the issue of the transfer of Japanese practices less important
over time.

The corporate culture myth
Newman, V. and Chaharbaghi, K.
Long Range Planning (UK), August 1998 Vol 31 No 4: p. 514 (9 pages)

Argues, forcibly, that studies of corporate culture are flawed and that cultural
studies involving observation consistently include alienation of the observer, a
content focus and the dangerous assumption that there is a universal meaning
to be generated from the observations made. Illustrates this with examples
from: the links made between modernity, flat organizations and open offices;
and single status and continuous improvement in Japanese manufacturers.
Examines the rhetoric of organizational culture and shows how an
understanding of integrated learning and the ‘‘data-information-knowledge-
technology’’ model can help develop a meaningful context for culture. Describes
the curse of ‘‘cultured organizations’’ and the risks and opportunities of culture.

The transfer of human resource and management practice by
Japanese multinationals to Australia: do industry size and
experience matter?
Purcell, W., Nicholas, S., Merrett, D. and Whitwell, G.
The International Journal of Human Resource Management (UK), February
1999 Vol 10 No 1: p. 72 (17 pages)

Investigates management and human resource management practices adopted
by Japanese multinational enterprises (MNEs) and how this transfers to an
Australian setting, using data drawn from ‘‘A Directory of Japanese Business
Activity in Australia – 1992’’. Refers to typical Japanese management practices,
such as life-time employment, seniority wages, enterprise unionism, on-the-job
training, multiskilling, flexible work practices, quality control and just-in-time
systems, and asks whether or not
these principles can be transplanted
successfully to another culture. Questions if firm size, industry sector, ownership
and experience all play a role in human resource management transfer. Frames
hypotheses around internalization theory and agency theory. Outlines the
research methodology used and techniques of data analysis. Reports that

organizational practices, including those related to human resource management,
partially as a control and monitoring device. Finds, however, that Japanese
incentive structures, such as life-time employment, were not transferred to
Australia, nevertheless, company policy generally worked towards creating a
similar commitment through, for example, high levels of job security. Indicates
that organizational practices are transferred in total, human resource practices
are transferred selectively, size of organization is not indicative of management
practices adopted, but experience, ownership and industry sector are all
significant factors in the adoption of Japanese management practices.

transplants located in the USA through a study of
the Nissan Motor
the general decline of union
Manufacturing Corporation. Considers
membership within the USA, citing a number of events that have contributed
to the quandary such as the General Motors strikes in 1996 and 1998. Explores
the efforts at unionization within the Japanese transplants, looking particularly
at the influence of organizational culture, Japanese organizational culture and
the adoption of Japanese management philosophy within these transplants, on
the effectiveness of these efforts. Addresses the union versus non-union issue,
illustrating that as a whole, and evidenced by the situation at Nissan, union-
free automotive manufacturers will continue to enjoy a measurable advantage
over those who have chosen to be represented by a union.

facilitated the spread of knowledge about a variety of management practices
across many countries and cultures. Discusses the characteristics of Japanese
organizations and compares them to those of organizations in the USA and
Europe;
Japanese, Anglo-Saxon and Korean organizational
structures; and argues that although there are some similarities between
Japanese and Korean models, there are also similarities between Korean and
Western, particularly French, management practices. Contends that further
convergence between East and West is likely since integration within the
European Union has encouraged, for example, Japanese and Korean companies
to operate in Europe and since the product range of Eastern countries is
moving in the same direction as the West. Concludes, however, that some key
differences remain relating to national cultures, particularly the role of
governments, which could inhibit the process of convergence.

A comparison of American and Japanese work practices: skill
formation, communications, and conflict resolution
Shibata, H.
Industrial Relations (USA), April 1999 Vol 38 No 2: p. 192 (23 pages)

Compares work practices at US and Japanese unionized firms in the early
1990s, focusing, in particular, on skills formation, communication and conflict
resolution. Bases this research on observation of first-line supervisors, workers
and local union executives and interviews with corporate executives at six
unionized manufacturing plants; three in the USA and three in Japan. Analyses
the training methods used in each of the plants, studying the use of on-the-job
and off-the-job training, including the use of job rotation and temporary and
permanent job transfers. Looks at the communications methods used, including
decision making and work organization, particularly the use of semi-
autonomous and self-managing teams. Sets out the number of grievances
raised within the plants and looks at the methods used to resolve these. Draws
this information together to analyse the similarities and differences between
the US and Japanese manufacturing plants.
