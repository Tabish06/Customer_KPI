ABSTRACT 

Anthony, Erica L. Ph.D., Purdue University, August 2012. What about Leader 
Empowerment? An Examination of the Antecedents and Consequences of 
Leader Empowerment. Major Professor: Bradley Alge. 
 
 
 

Research on psychological empowerment has been limited to the within-

level examination of the precursors and outcomes of psychological 

empowerment.  Although beneficial, there is a paucity of research that has 

examined the psychological empowerment of leaders, individuals who are mid-

level managers or higher within the organization, and how their sense of being 

psychologically empowered influences their followers.  Leaders drive 

organizational results by inspiring employees to accomplish a higher goal and 

mission.  Further insights are warranted to understand the mechanisms that 

create empowerment for leaders and the benefits of leader empowerment for the 

organization.  Therefore, the purpose of this dissertation research is to examine 

the drivers that facilitate leaders being psychologically empowered, the behaviors 

that leaders engage in once they are empowered, and consequences of their 

empowerment and behavior on their followers.   

With a sample of 75 leaders and 188 subordinates from various industries, 

the results of my study suggest, contrary to expectations, that a curvilinear 

relationship exists between leader-leader exchange and leader psychological 


x 

empowerment.  Next, I find that leaders who are more politically savvy are more 

likely to have a higher sense of empowerment than leaders who are less 

politically savvy.  Furthermore, the findings of this study suggest there may be a 

positive relationship between leader psychological empowerment and follower 

psychological empowerment, however, further examination of the intervening 

factors that explain this relationship is warranted.  Last, consistent with previous 

studies, follower psychological empowerment is positively related to follower 

organizational citizenship behaviors, creative performance, and affective 

organizational commitment.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT 

 

Psychological empowerment, defined as intrinsic task motivation 

manifested in four cognitions, meaning (the value of a work goal or purpose, 

judged in relation to an individual's own ideals or standards), competence (an 

individual's belief in his or her capability to perform activities with skill), self-

determination (an individual's sense of having choice in initiating and regulating 

actions), and impact (the degree to which an individual can influence strategic, 

administrative, or operating outcomes at work), has played a prominent role in 

theory, practice, and research on motivation generally, and intrinsic motivation 

specifically.  In practice, organizations spend significant employee development 

dollars to improve the empowerment of employees (ASTD, 2008; SHRM, 2006).  

The reason why organizations invest in improving the level of empowerment of 

their employees is due to the positive outcomes associated with empowerment. 

Over the past three decades, research has focused on factors that 

influence employee empowerment and the outcomes of empowered employees 

(see Figure 1 for a summary).   Psychologically empowered individuals, in turn, 

engage in work behaviors (e.g., creative performance) and develop attitudes 

(e.g., job satisfaction).  Research suggests that empowerment is influenced by 

individual differences, the nature of the work itself, or certain leader behaviors 


2 

that increases the intrinsic motivation of the individuals.  Furthermore, once 

empowered, individuals will engage in behaviors that have a positive impact on 

the organization.  

Although interesting, much of this research, however, has focused on a 

within-level understanding of individual psychological empowerment.  

Particularly, research has focused on the individual-level factors (e.g., individual  

differences, individual perceptions of context) that facilitate an individualsâ sense 

of empowerment.  What has not been extensively examined to date, however, is 

a multi-level examination of psychological empowerment, an examination 

focusing on factors that contribute to leaders being psychologically empowered, 

and whether leader psychological empowerment is positively associated with 

follower psychological empowerment. Due to the pivotal roles of leaders within 

organizations, as drivers of employee motivation (including employee 

psychological empowerment), understanding the drivers that facilitate their level 

of intrinsic motivation may have implications and value for employee and 

organizational performance. 

Leaders, by means of direct and indirect influence of employees, are 

instrumental for driving organizational performance (Northouse, 2010).   Effective 

leaders are visionary and have the ability to inspire followers to achieve a higher 

level mission or goal (Yukl, 2006).  As such, leaders, by nature of their position, 

have authority and power to achieve organizational goals.  Naturally, one may 

question why research on leader empowerment is important when leaders have 

power and decision making authority, and therefore, should be empowered.  I 


3 

contend that leaders can have power without being empowered.  Anecdotal data 

from former United States President Bill Clinton on National Public Radio 

suggests that as a leader he had a lot of impact to help a lot of people, however, 

he did not have a high sense of autonomy in his role as President (Sagal, 2011).  

This suggests that leaders by nature of their position possess power and are able 

to play a pivotal role with driving organizational results; however it is unclear how 

their cognitions facilitate this process.  Thus, further research is warranted to 

understand their cognitions and behaviors and how these may trickle down to 

affect employees under their leadership.   

Although much progress has been made regarding the impact that 

psychological empowerment has contributed to the management literature, this 

study extends research on psychological empowerment by exploring the factors 

that contribute to a leaderâs psychological empowerment and resulting leader 

behaviors.  Furthermore, due to previous research findings suggesting that 

leaders are instrumental for influencing the intrinsic motivation and behaviors of 

their followers, I also seek to understand how leader psychological empowerment 

affects a followerâs sense of empowerment and consequently, the behaviors and 

attitudes of followers.  Specifically, I examine if empowerment of the leader is 

positively associated with empowerment of the follower.  In developing my 

conceptual model of leader empowerment, I introduce two antecedents of leader 

psychological empowerment and examine how leader empowerment contributes 

to follower empowerment.  With this research, I seek to answer: Does leader 

empowerment influence follower empowerment?  If so, what are the conditions 


4 

for that to occur?  Drawing upon leadership theory, intrinsic motivation theory, job 

attitudes, and management research, my aim is to contribute to existing research 

in two ways.   

First, I propose a framework of antecedents to leader empowerment that 

takes into consideration a leaderâs unique context.  Specifically, I examine 

interpersonal/relational (i.e., Leader-Leader Exchange, also referred to as LLX) 

and interpersonal/behavioral (i.e., political skills) factors that likely influence a 

leaderâs sense of empowerment.   Previous studies suggest leader-member 

exchange (Gomez & Rosen, 2001; Liden, Wayne, & Sparrowe, 2000) is a key 

factor for influencing empowerment.  I extend this notion by examining the 

leaderâs upper level relationship (LLX â the quality of the relationship a leader 

has with his or her superior) as a driver for leader psychological empowerment.  

Furthermore, due to the dynamic nature of organizations and the interpersonal 

relationships leaders must engage in to accomplish organizational goals, political 

skill is posited to be another key factor that will drive leader empowerment.   

Next, I draw upon job attitudes and leadership theory to explain how the 

leaderâs sense of empowerment influences his or her followers.  Specifically, I 

examine how the leaderâs psychological empowerment impacts his or her 

leadership behaviors (i.e., delegation, close supervision, and transformational 

leadership) and how those behaviors further impact followersâ cognitions, 

behaviors, and job attitudes.   

Furthermore, by examining multiple levels within an organization, I am 

able to explore an area of research that to my knowledge has not been 


5 

addressed.  Studies have examined macro and micro areas of empowerment 

such as the impact of empowerment climate, manager status, and manager span 

of control on follower empowerment, however, studies have not fully examined 

the impact that leadership has on follower empowerment.   Implicit in the 

literature is a multiple-level aspect of empowerment, however to my knowledge; 

this has never been made theoretically explicit.  Therefore a multi-level 

perspective of empowerment is subjected to an empirical test that will be 

conducted in this study.  In sum, I extend previous empirical findings and 

contribute to management literature by examining the leaderâs sense of 

empowerment as a precursor for follower empowerment, which is a strength of 

this study. 

In the next section, I develop a theoretical model of leader empowerment 

(see Figure 2) wherein I identify and define antecedents of leader empowerment, 

leader behavioral reactions resulting from leader empowerment, and the 

downstream impact on follower empowerment.

CHAPTER 2 THEORY AND HYPOTHESES 

2.1 Antecedents of Leader Psychological Empowerment 

 

Over the years scholars have sought to bridge the gap between macro, 

meso, and micro perspectives of leadership (Gardner & Cogliser, 2009; Hannah 

& Lester, 2009; Osborn, Hunt, & Jauch, 2002), emphasizing the interplay 

between cross-level, interactive, and reciprocal effects of environmental, 

organizational, network, group, dyadic, and individual-level variables with 

leadership processes (Gardner & Cogliser, 2009).  I examine the two 

interpersonal (relational and behavioral) factors that I posit will influence leader 

psychological empowerment:  leader-leader exchange or LLX (an interpersonal 

factor that is primarily relational) and political skill (an interpersonal factor that is 

primarily behavioral).   

 

My rationale for selecting these two factors is predicated on the 

assumption that as leaders move up within the organization, the nature of their 

role and responsibilities become more complex, and consequently, their 

relational linkages become more prominent.  In terms of LLX, the interpersonal 

relationships developed between individuals are instrumental for oneâs 

perception of empowerment.  For instance, LMX research asserts that high 

quality exchanges that occur between the member and leader are influential for 


7 

member empowerment (Aryee & Chen, 2006; G. Chen, Kirkman, Kanfer, Allen, & 

Rosen, 2007; Liden et al., 2000).  I contend that this relationship is likely true as 

leaders advance within the organizational hierarchy.  High quality exchanges 

between the leader and his or her superior (LLX) will be instrumental for the 

leaderâs sense of empowerment.   

 

In terms of political skill, leader empowerment may also be influenced by 

the extent to which a leader can effectively manage political relationships.  

Organizations are known as political arenas (Mintzberg, 1985).  Leaders, due to 

their roles and responsibilities, are expected to be politically skilled in managing 

their interpersonal relationships to accomplish organizational goals.  

Consequently, leaders who are politically savvy may perceive themselves as 

more empowered.  In the following sections, I discuss in detail how leader-leader 

exchange and leader political skill may influence a leaderâs sense of 

psychological empowerment. 

 

2.1.1 Leader-Leader Exchange (Interpersonal/Relational Factor) 

Leader-Leader Exchange (LLX) is an upper dyadic relationship in an 

organizational hierarchy involving the leader and his or her superior (Tangirala, 

Green, & Ramanujam, 2007).  Consistent with Leader-Member Exchange (LMX), 

I suggest that LLX will influence a leaderâs sense of empowerment.  Leader-

Member Exchange is a dyadic relationship that occurs between a leader and 

follower (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995).  Previous studies have demonstrated a 

positive association between LMX and such variables as decision influence 


8 

(Dansereau, Graen, & Haga, 1975; Graen & Cashman, 1975; Liden & Graen, 

1980; Scandura, Graen, & Novak, 1986; Schriesheim, Neider, Scandura, & 

Tepper, 1992), task variety (Dunegan, Duchon, & Uhl-Bien, 1992) and support 

for members' self-worth (Keller & Dansereau, 1995). Higher levels of decision-

making influence and responsibility provide meaning, feelings of self-efficacy, a 

sense of impact, and perceptions of self-determination which are aligned with the 

four key dimensions of empowerment (Spreitzer, 1995b; Thomas & Velthouse, 

1990). Thus, the quality of LMX relationships determines the extent to which 

leaders grant members the latitude and support that are the necessary drivers for 

oneâs sense of empowerment.    

LMX research has demonstrated strong support for influencing 

empowerment.  For example, with a field study, Liden et al. (2000) demonstrated 

a positive relationship between LMX and the impact and self-determination 

dimensions of empowerment.   Gomez and Rosen (2001) suggest that a feeling 

of contribution is instrumental for one to have a sense of impact with their work 

role and that greater job responsibilities should translate to an increased 

perception of self-determination.   These cognitive perceptions may develop as a 

result of the interactions that occur between the leader and follower.  Particularly, 

employees in high-quality LMX relationships may perceive greater latitude, 

decision influence, and feelings of contribution when the leader provides more 

delegation, responsibility, and autonomy (Gomez & Rosen, 2001).   

This idea is also supported in a study conducted by Aryee and Chen 

(2006) who utilized a sample of Chinese employees from an organization located 


9 

in Guangdong Province, Peopleâs Republic of China.  They argue that LMX 

relates to empowerment dimensions in several ways.  First, they contend that the 

task challenge and access to information enjoyed by followers in high-quality 

LMX relationships contribute to their sense of meaning in the context of work.  

Second, the decisional responsibility enjoyed by these followers allows them to 

perform their task autonomously influencing their sense of self-determination. 

Third, the combination of supervisory support and professional growth, as well as, 

the opportunity to experience success inherent in task challenge afforded by the 

quality of the LMX relationship contribute to the followersâ feelings of competence.  

Last, the decisional influence and responsibility enjoyed by high quality LMX 

followers may enhance their perceptions of making a difference or having an 

impact on outcomes at work (Aryee & Chen, 2006).   

Finally, Chen and associates (2007) conducted a multi-level study that 

consisted of 445 members from 62 teams in 31 stores of a Fortune 500 home 

improvement company in various locations throughout United States.  This study 

sampled 62 team leaders and 31 managers, who completed surveys during 

regular work hours.  Results from this study showed that LMX positively 

predicted individual empowerment (G. Chen et al., 2007).  In sum, these 

empirical findings support LMX quality as a positive influence on followersâ 

cognitions of empowerment. 

  I anticipate that this relationship will extend to leaders as well.  

Particularly, leaders in high-quality upper dyadic relationships will have a higher 

sense of empowerment.  Leaders in high-quality LLX relationships will see 


10 

themselves as belonging to the organizational in-group and consequently as 

having high status in the organization (Dienesch & Liden, 1986; Tangirala et al., 

2007).  Furthermore, leaders in high-quality LLX relationships receive more 

inside information, greater influence in decisions, higher degrees of job latitude, 

and greater support from their bosses (Graen, Cashman, Ginsburg, & 

Schiemann, 1977).  Consistent with previous LMX findings and current LLX 

theory, I predict that:  

Hypothesis 1: Leader-leader exchange will positively relate to leader 

psychological empowerment. 

 

2.1.2 Leader Political Skill (Interpersonal/Behavioral Factor) 

Political skill is âthe ability to effectively understand others at work, and to 

use such knowledge to influence others to act in ways that enhance oneâs 

personal and/or organizational objectivesâ (Ferris, Treadway, Kolodinsky, 

Hochwater, Kacmar, Douglas, & Fink, 2005, p. 127).  Ferris et al. (2005) 

conceptualized political skill as a multidimensional construct comprised of social 

astuteness (the ability to observe others and to be keenly attuned to diverse 

social situations), interpersonal influence (the ability to have a subtle convincing 

personal style that exerts a powerful influence on those around them), 

networking ability (the ability to develop and use diverse networks of people), and 

apparent sincerity (the ability to appear to others as possessing high levels of 

integrity, authenticity, sincerity, and genuineness).  Politically skilled individuals 

combine social astuteness with the capacity to adjust their behavior to different 


11 

and changing situational demands in a manner that appears to be sincere, 

inspires support and trust, and effectively influences and controls the responses 

of others (Ferris, Treadway, Perrewe, Brouer, Douglas, & Lux, 2007).  

 

Leaders are able to cultivate their political skill as they accrue work-

relevant experiences.  Organizations are considered to be political arenas 

(Mintzberg, 1985) where political behavior is standard operating procedure 

(Pfeffer, 1981).  Politically skilled leaders possess the ability to easily 

comprehend social cues and accurately attribute the behavioral motivations of 

others.  Additionally, through political skill, leaders are able to influence and 

control people and situations with minimum effort.  Last, leaders who are 

politically skilled can more effectively build networks and social capital necessary 

to both elevate their status within the organization, and provide scarce resources 

to their followers (Treadway, Hochwater, Ferris, Kacmar, Douglas, Ammeter, & 

Buckley, 2004).  In sum, politically savvy leaders implement behaviors that 

directly affect important leader-level outcomes.  Particularly, politically skilled 

leaders should realize increased organizational power, heightened interpersonal 

reputation, and greater organizational rewards than leaders who lack political skill 

(Treadway et al., 2004).  These benefits will enhance a leaderâs sense of 

psychological empowerment.   Leaders who have increased organizational 

power and credibility and are perceived as worthy organizational members will 

have a higher sense of meaning, self-determination, impact, and competence.   

Thus: 


12 

Hypothesis 2: Leader political skill will positively relate to leader psychological 

empowerment. 

 

2.2 Consequences of Leader Psychological Empowerment 

Having examined the drivers of leader empowerment, this section 

addresses the relationship between leader and follower empowerment and the 

intervening factors that may explain this relationship, an area to my knowledge 

that hasnât been previously examined.  Previous studies have demonstrated that 

follower empowerment is enhanced when leaders provide support, delegate 

control over decisions, and are inspirational (Avolio, Zhu, Koh, & Bhatia, 2004; Z. 

X. Chen & Aryee, 2007; Gerstner & Day, 1997; Liden et al., 2000; Schriesheim, 

Castro, & Yammarino, 2000).  What has not been fully examined is why leaders 

engage in these behaviors.  I posit that empowerment may be instrumental with 

explaining why leaders engage in these behaviors.  Empowered leaders will see 

themselves as competent and able to influence their jobs and work environments 

in meaningful ways (Avolio, Zhu, Koh, & Bhatia, 2004; Pieterse, van 

Knippenberg, Schippers, & Stam, 2010; Spreitzer, 1995b).  This influence will 

extend to the relationship that leaders have with their followers.   

Previous research has demonstrated that individuals influence their 

environment by engaging in certain behaviors and these behaviors and the 

environment, in turn, influence others within the organization (Bandura, 1989).  

Thus, there is the potential that empowered leaders will influence followers 

through behaviors that lead followers to heightened levels of empowerment.  I 


13 

posit that leaders who are empowered will want to develop a positive and 

productive work environment for their subordinates and engage in behaviors that 

will motivate and elevate their employeesâ behaviors.  Research has 

demonstrated that empowered individuals feel less constrained by their jobs and 

have more discretion to act as moral agents and engage in helping behaviors 

towards others (Alge, Ballinger, Tangirala, & Oakley, 2006; Bandura, 2001).  

Empowered leaders may engage in empowering behaviors due to their desire to 

satisfy a higher order need or to align their behaviors with their individual values 

(Piccolo & Colquitt, 2006). Empowering behaviors, such as more delegation, less 

close supervision, and more transformational leadership behaviors (the three 

intervening leader behaviors that are the focus of my model) are posited to 

empower. 

 

2.2.1 The Mediating Role of Leader Delegation Behaviors 

Empowered leaders view their work as more meaningful and impactful, 

and believe they can perform their work roles with greater confidence and 

autonomy.  As a result, empowered leaders, in turn, will aspire to empower their 

subordinates, thereby, engaging in behaviors such as delegation, to improve 

their subordinateâs performance and work attitudes.  Delegation is a leader 

behavior whereby the leader assigns and thereby relinquishes responsibilities 

and authority to their subordinates (Z. X. Chen & Aryee, 2007; Schriesheim, 

Neider, & Scandura, 1998; Yukl & Fu, 1999).  Research exploring the attributes 

and factors of why leaders engage in delegation are quite limited (Bass, 1990).   


14 

It has been proposed, however, that a key characteristic of why leaders delegate 

is likely due to their desire to develop their subordinates.  As empowered leaders 

seek to align their behaviors with their values, they are more-so motivated to 

engage in behaviors, such as delegation, which will assist with the development 

of their subordinates.  Delegation allows subordinates to deal with established 

norms and conflict in their work roles and further their growth by developing 

analytical and collaboration skills.  Moreover, empowered leaders may engage in 

delegation behaviors due to their aspirations to develop their subordinateâs 

cognitive and interpersonal styles (Hollander & Offermann, 1990; Leana, 1986, 

1987; Valcea, Hamdani, Buckley, & Novicevic, 2011).  Accordingly, as 

empowered leaders delegate they enable their subordinates to acquire expanded 

skills, autonomy, and increased responsibility.  Consequently, delegation results 

in more empowered subordinates.  Thus, I predict that:   

Hypothesis 3A: Delegation will mediate the positive influence of leader 

psychological empowerment on follower psychological empowerment, 

such that the positive relationship between leader psychological 

empowerment and delegation will carry through to follower psychological 

empowerment. 

 

2.2.2 The Mediating Role of Leader Close Supervision Behaviors 

Empowered leaders are less likely to closely supervise subordinates, 

enhancing subordinate psychological empowerment.   When leaders engage in 

close supervision, they micro-manage their subordinates to ensure that their 


15 

subordinates do what they are told, perform tasks in expected ways, and not 

engage in behaviors that the leader might disapprove of.  Consequently, when 

leaders engage in close supervision, subordinates often feel that they are 

constantly being evaluated, directed, and controlled (George & Zhou, 2001; Ryan 

& Grolnick, 1986; Tetrick, 1989; Zhou, 2003).  Accordingly, subordinatesâ 

empowerment is also hindered.  Close supervision can be seen as a controlling 

practice that makes the employees worry about doing something that may 

receive the disapproval of their leaders, as well as, be distracted by and 

preoccupied with irrelevant work concerns and fears.  Consequently, close 

supervision pressures subordinates to do certain things in certain ways, which 

facilitates the perception of an external locus of causality for behavior and 

undermines intrinsic motivation (i.e. psychological empowerment) (Deci & Ryan, 

1985; Ryan, 1982; Zhou, 2003).  This contradicts the goals that empowered 

leaders have for their followers. 

Empowered leaders, due to aspirations to develop their subordinates and 

their desire to create a positive and productive work environment for their 

subordinates, will engage in less micro-managing behaviors.  When empowered 

leaders do not closely supervise their subordinates, the subordinateâs sense of 

psychological empowerment is not diminished because there is little external 

pressure of doing certain things in certain ways.  As a result, the subordinates 

are relatively free from irrelevant work worries and fears and can concentrate on 

specific work tasks.   Accordingly, I predict: 


16 

Hypothesis 3B: Close supervision will mediate the positive influence of 

leader psychological empowerment on follower psychological 

empowerment, such that the negative relationship between leader 

psychological empowerment and close supervision will carry through to 

follower psychological empowerment. 

 

2.2.3 The Mediating Role of Transformational Leadership Behaviors 

Last, empowered leaders may engage in transformational leadership 

behaviors as a mechanism to empower their followers.  Transformational leaders 

have the ability to transform followersâ attitudes, beliefs, and values by 

demonstrating idealized influence (the degree to which leaders behave in 

charismatic ways that cause followers to identify with them), inspirational 

motivation (the degree to which leaders articulate visions that are appealing to 

followers), intellectual stimulation (the degree to which leaders challenge 

assumptions, take risks, and solicit followers), and individualized consideration 

(the degree to which leaders attend to followersâ needs, act as mentors or 

coaches, and listen to followers concerns) (Avolio & Bass, 2004; Bass, 1985; 

Piccolo & Colquitt, 2006; Rafferty & Griffin, 2004).  For which, transformational 

leadership is thought to be a mechanism for organizations to encourage 

employees to perform beyond expectations and develop to their fullest potential 

(Bass, 1985).  Leaders who exhibit transformational leadership often have a 

strong set of internal values and ideals, and they are effective at motivating 


17 

followers to act in ways that support the greater good rather than their own self-

interests (Kuhnert, 1994). 

I assert that positive thoughts can lead to positive actions.  Being that 

empowerment is a proactive orientation towards an individualâs work role, 

empowered individuals may significantly influence organizational activities and 

decisions (Spreitzer, 1995b, 1996).  As previously discussed, psychologically 

empowered individuals will have a higher perception of their capabilities within 

their work role (Avolio et al., 2004; Pieterse et al., 2010; Spreitzer, 1995b).  

These cognitions will manifest themselves in behaviors that will motivate and 

elevate employee behaviors.  Although limited, previous research suggest that 

empowered managers are more likely to be transformational leaders, and 

thereby, focus on employeesâ overall inputs rather than scrutinizing specific 

objective performance outcomes (Martin & Bush, 2006; Spreitzer, De Janasz, & 

Quinn, 1999).  For example, Spreitzer et al. (1999) found that empowered mid-

level managers were perceived by their subordinates as being more inspirational.  

This is further supported by Martin and Bush (2006) who utilized sales managers 

and sales representatives from multiple organizations within the United States to 

examine the relationship between empowerment and transformational leadership 

behaviors.  The results of their study demonstrated a positive relationship 

between empowered sales managers engaging in transformational leadership 

behaviors (Martin & Bush, 2006).  Therefore, empowered leaders are more likely 

to engage in transformational leadership behaviors, which in turn, have been 

shown to have a positive impact on follower psychological empowerment. 


18 

Transformational leadership entails elevating the needs of the follower that 

are in line with the leaderâs own goals and objectives (Bass, 1985; Bass, 

Waldman, Avolio, & Bebb, 1987; Burns, 1978).   Transformational leaders 

transform their followersâ aspirations, identities, needs, preferences, and values 

such that followers are able to reach their full potential (Lowe, Kroeck, & 

Sivasubramaniam, 1996).  Followers of transformational leaders are expected to 

identify with their leaders and therefore experience an increased confidence that 

they can have an impact on their organization (Laschinger, Finegan, & Shamian, 

2001).  These leaders also provide meaning and challenge to their followersâ 

work, as well as, enhance followersâ levels of self-efficacy, confidence, meaning, 

and self-determination - the key components of psychological empowerment.   

Transformational leaders accomplish this in several ways. 

   When articulating idealized future goals, transformational leaders 

energize and enhance their followersâ sense of empowerment (Kanungo & 

Mendonca, 1996).  Particularly, these leaders empower subordinates by 

providing clarity of direction and by emphasizing a higher purpose or worthy 

cause (Burke, 1986).    Research also suggests that transformational leaders 

empower followers by generating enthusiasm for achieving a goal and by 

providing meaning in the followerâs work (Avolio et al., 2004; Bass, 1999; Conger 

& Kanungo, 1988a; Menon, 2001).  Additionally, transformational leaders also 

inspire the cognitive states of empowerment by expressing confidence in 

followerâs abilities to deliver high performance (Bandura, 1989; Burke, 1986; 

Conger, 1989; Conger & Kanungo, 1988a; House, 1977; Kirkman & Rosen, 1999; 


19 

Shamir, House, & Arthur, 1993).  This form of inspirational motivation directly 

enhances followersâ feelings of self-efficacy (Conger & Kanungo, 1988b) and 

perceived competence (Menon, 2001; Spreitzer, 1995b; Thomas & Velthouse, 

1990).   

Next, intellectual stimulation implemented by the leader may challenge 

their followersâ thoughts, imagination, and creativity (Bass, 1999; Rafferty & 

Griffin, 2004).  Such intellectual stimulation could excite a sense of self-

determination within followers.   Intellectual stimulation may also be a mechanism 

for leaders to show followers that they value their contribution, which can 

stimulate feelings of perceived competence or self-efficacy and impact.   

Last, individualized consideration and idealized influence also impacts 

followersâ sense of empowerment.  When leaders demonstrate these behaviors, 

they support the followersâ need for achievement and professional growth.  In 

turn, followers are encouraged to increase their responsibilities in developing 

their full potential which influences their cognitive states of empowerment (Avolio 

et al., 2004).  Work by Avolio and colleagues (Avolio, Bass, & Jung, 1999; Bass 

& Avolio, 1994; Luthans & Avolio, 2003) demonstrates that followers who work 

with leaders that exhibit high moral standards and expectations, integrity, and 

optimism are more empowered to do the activities required for successful task 

accomplishment.  In sum, empowered leader behaviors are influential for 

followers to have meaning, impact, competence, and self-determination in their 

work role.  Therefore, I hypothesize that: 


20 

Hypothesis 3C: Transformational leadership will mediate the positive 

influence of leader psychological empowerment on follower psychological 

empowerment, such that the positive relationship between leader 

psychological empowerment and transformational leadership will carry 

through to follower psychological empowerment. 

In the previous sections I discuss the intervening factors that may facilitate how a 

leader who is psychologically empowered may influence a subordinateâs sense of 

empowerment.  I extend this notion by examining how a leaderâs need for power 

may further explain the indirect relationship between leader and subordinate 

psychological empowerment.   

 

2.2.4 Moderating Effects of Leader Need for Power 

Need for power is the desire to influence others, change people or events, 

and make a difference in life (Liu, Liu, & Wu, 2010; McClelland & Burnham, 

1976).  To satisfy this power motive, individuals must be able to engage in social 

interactions that allow for influence.  Unfortunately, organizations with a culture 

for high power distance limit an individualâs ability to satisfy their need for power.  

Research suggests that individuals with a high need for power experience a 

sense of powerlessness and constraint when engaged in an environment with 

high power distance (i.e., the inequality among individuals in different positions of 

formal power) (Drach-Zahavy, 2004; Hon & Leung, 2011).  Leaders who maintain 

a high power distance between their subordinates may desire to enhance their 

status within the organizational hierarchy and emphasize their role for dominance 


21 

and control (Drach-Zahavy, 2004; Earley, 1999; Schaubroeck, Lam, & Cha, 

2007).  Although this form of leadership strategy may be successful for 

organizational cultures where high power distance is acceptable, engaging in 

high power distance with organizations seeking to foster an empowered 

environment for their employees is considered to be ineffectual (Robert, Probst, 

Martocchio, Drasgow, & Lawler, 2000).  As such, I expect that an empowered 

leader with a high need for power will desire to minimize the power distance with 

their employees and engage in behaviors that will be empowering for their 

subordinates.  Particularly, empowered leaders will provide an environment that 

is participative and promotes autonomy for organizational employees (Huang & 

Van de Vliert, 2003).  As organizations seek to improve the empowerment of 

their employees (ASTD, 2008; SHRM, 2006), organizations must promote an 

environment with where there is minimal power distance between leaders and 

followers.  Therefore, the theoretical framework presented in this study focuses 

on leader empowerment and power motives within organizations where minimal 

power distance exists.  

Empowered leaders with a high need for power are able to use social 

interactions to generate situations for influence, engage in formal and informal 

leadership roles, and seek promotion (Lin, 2006, 2008; Steinmetz, Park, & Kabst, 

2011).  These leaders seek career advancement, and therefore, how they 

engage and influence others will be instrumental for that to occur.  As such, there 

are clear implications for positive outcomes of empowered leaders with a high 

need for power.   


22 

As discussed in the previous sections, empowered leaders will engage in 

more delegation, less close supervision, and more transformational leadership 

behaviors as a mechanism to empower their subordinates.  I posit that 

empowered leaders will be more motivated to engage in these behaviors when 

they have a high power motivation due to their concern and focus with having a 

positive impact on others.  Leaders with a high need for power find strength with 

their ability to influence others rather than obtaining personal achievement 

(McClelland & Burnham, 1976) resulting in their means to nurture the success of 

their subordinates and organizations. They aim and derive satisfaction when they 

are able to make their subordinates feel strong, capable, and responsible, rather 

than weak, incompetent, and powerless (McClelland & Burnham, 1976; Spreier, 

Fontaine, & Malloy, 2006).  This impact will heighten for leaders who are 

psychologically empowered.  Empowered leaders with a high, rather than low, 

need for power will have a strong focus on the development of their followers.  

Moreover, empowered leaders will seek success, promotion, and prestige by 

establishing good relationships with others (Hon & Leung, 2011; Lin, 2006, 

2008). Therefore, empowered leaders with a high power motivation will influence 

and empower their subordinates by engaging in positive leadership behaviors 

(i.e., more delegation, reduced close supervision, and more transformational 

leadership behaviors).  Conversely, empowered leaders with a low need for 

power will focus less on the development and self-worth of their followers.  

Therefore, I predict: 


23 

Hypothesis 4A:  The indirect effect of leader psychological empowerment 

on follower psychological empowerment through delegation is moderated 

by leader need for power, such that, the indirect effect is stronger (more 

positive) when leader need for power is high than when it is low. 

 

Hypothesis 4B:  The indirect effect of leader psychological empowerment 

on follower psychological empowerment through close supervision is 

moderated by leader need for power, such that, the indirect effect is 

weaker (more negative) when leader need for power is high than when it 

is low. 

 

Hypothesis 4C:  The indirect effect of leader psychological empowerment 

on follower psychological empowerment through transformational 

leadership is moderated by leader need for power, such that, the indirect 

effect is stronger (more positive) when leader need for power is high than 

when it is low. 

2.3 Follower Impact 

Research suggests that empowered followers are better performers, 

engaging in extra-role behaviors and providing improved creativity (Alge et al., 

2006; Huang, Iun, Liu, & Gong, 2010).  Furthermore, empowered followers also 

develop a strong commitment towards the organization (Avolio et al., 2004; 

Eisenberger, Fasolo, & Davislamastro, 1990; Kraimer, Seibert, & Liden, 1999).  

Consistent with previous findings, I will examine three outcomes of follower 


empowerment: OCB, creative performance, and affective organizational 

24 

commitment.     

 

2.3.1 Follower Organizational Citizenship Behaviors 

Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is defined as performance that 

supports the social and psychological environment in which task performance 

takes place (Organ, 1997).  Central to this definition is that OCBs are employee 

behaviors that, although not critical to the task or job, serve to facilitate 

organizational functioning (Lee & Allen, 2002).   

Empirical studies suggest that when employees have a sense of 

ownership and responsibility for work outcomes, they are willing to do whatever it 

takes to make the organization successful (Huang et al., 2010).  Feelings of 

empowerment can enhance oneâs identity with his or her organization and also 

lead to a stronger tendency to help the organization (Alge et al., 2006; Y. H. 

Chan, Taylor, & Markham, 2008; Messersmith, Patel, & Lepak, 2011; Seibert, 

Silver, & Randolph, 2004).  Followers have more discretion to act as moral 

agents to help others without fear of repercussion (Alge et al., 2006; Bandura, 

2001).  Particularly, they will have a higher sense of autonomy, and therefore, 

are likely to engage in discretionary behavior when they have such autonomy.  

Furthermore, when followers identify with their organization, they in turn, have a 

higher sense of impact and meaning (i.e. dimensions of psychological 

empowerment) and personal responsibility for achieving organizational goals 

(Choi, 2007; Deci & Ryan, 1985; Oldham & Cummings, 1996).  Therefore, when 


25 

an organization creates conditions to enhance the value of oneâs membership in 

that organization, social identity and exchange motives lead followers to 

reciprocate by engaging in discretionary behaviors (Alge et al., 2006; Brief & 

Motowidlo, 1986; Van Dick, Hirst, Grojean, & Wieseke, 2007).  In sum, when 

empowered followers identify more with their organization they have greater 

latitude to engage in extra-role activities.   Therefore, I hypothesize that: 

Hypothesis 5A: Follower psychological empowerment will positively relate 

to follower organizational citizenship behaviors. 

 

2.3.2 Follower Creative Performance 

Creative performance (the generation of new ideas, products or 

procedures useful to organizations) is a discretionary behavior that is important 

for organizational survival (Alge et al., 2006; Amabile, 1988; George & Zhou, 

2001).  Psychological empowerment is considered to be a precursor to creativity 

(Amabile, 1983, 1997; Tierney, Farmer, & Graen, 1999).   Research suggests 

that autonomy, a dimension of empowerment, is an important determinant of 

organizational creativity because individuals produce more creative work when 

they perceive more personal control over how to accomplish given tasks 

(Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, & Herron, 1996). Therefore, empowered 

employees, through more perceived personal control, are more likely to be 

intrinsically motivated, which influences creative behaviors or outcomes (Jung, 

Chow, & Wu, 2003; Jung & Sosik, 2002).   


26 

Moreover, there are a number of studies that support the intrinsic 

motivation and creative performance relationship (Amabile, Hill, Hennessey, & 

Tighe, 1994; Zhou, 1998).   For example, Alge et al. (2006) found a positive 

relationship between psychological empowerment and creative performance.  

Next, a field study with 163 R & D personnel and managers with Turkish software 

development companies demonstrated a positive association between 

psychological empowerment and creativity (Gumusluoglu & Ilsev, 2009).   Third, 

Zhang and Bartol (2010) found a positive relationship between psychological 

empowerment and creativity with a sample of professional-level employees 

within a major IT firm from the Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC).  Last, similar 

results were found with a field study with participants from multiple 

pharmaceutical companies from the Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC) (Sun, 

Zhang, Qi, & Chen, 2012).  Collectively, these prior studies have provided a 

strong theoretical basis for expecting that empowerment would enhance 

creativity among followers. Thus: 

Hypothesis 5B: Follower psychological empowerment will positively relate 

to follower creative performance. 

 

2.3.3 Follower Affective Organizational Commitment 

Affective organizational commitment is defined as the relative strength of 

an individualâs identification, attachment, and involvement in a particular 

organization (Allen & Meyer, 1990; Liden et al., 2000; Mowday, Steers, & Porter, 

1979).  Studies suggest that psychological empowerment influences affective 


27 

commitment for many reasons.  To begin, the meaning dimension of 

psychological empowerment invokes affective organizational commitment 

because it considers the fit between the demands of the work role and the 

individual's needs and values (Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman, & Johnson, 2005; 

Seibert, Wang, & Courtright, 2011; Spreitzer, 1995a). Additionally, feelings of 

autonomy, competence, and impact are likely to increase the individual's 

commitment to the organization, as they will further increase the individualâs 

ability to express his or her values and interests through their work.  Empirical 

findings have supported this notion. 

Previous empirical work has demonstrated a strong association between 

empowerment and affective commitment (Meyer, Becker, & Vandenberghe, 2004; 

Seibert et al., 2011).  For instance, Liden et al. (2000) conducted a field study 

with 337 participants to examine the mediating effects of psychological 

empowerment between LMX, TMX, and job characteristics on work outcomes.  

The results of their study demonstrated a positive significant association between 

affective commitment and the four dimensions of psychological empowerment.  

Next, Avolio et al. (2004) examined the mediating effects of psychological 

empowerment between transformational leadership and affective commitment 

with a sample of staff nurses.  Consistent with previous findings, their results also 

reveal that psychological empowerment is positively associated with affective 

commitment.  Last, in a recent meta-analytical study by Seibert, et al. (2011), 

affective commitment was found to be a significant outcome of psychological 

empowerment.  Collectively, these studies suggest that empowered followers are 


28 

more likely to reciprocate with higher levels of commitment to their organizations 

(Eisenberger et al., 1990; Kraimer et al., 1999). Based on the arguments above, I 

hypothesize that: 

Hypothesis 5C: Follower psychological empowerment will positively relate 

to follower affective organizational commitment.


29 

CHAPTER 3 METHODS 

3.1 Sample and Procedures 

Participants were recruited from a department within a large U.S.-based 

telecommunications company and various organizations via an alumni database 

from a large public university.  Critical to the design was the availability of 

responses from leaders and subordinates in each organization, allowing a multi-

level, hierarchical test of the proposed model. The benefit of examining a multi-

level model of empowerment promotes an understanding how leaders are 

empowered and if leader empowerment is instrumental for their followers to 

develop empowerment, a primary focus of this study.  Additionally, studying a 

cross-section of organizations from different industries increases the 

generalizability of findings and applicability of my model. 

Web-based survey administration for the U.S.-based telecommunications 

company and alumni followed a multi-contact strategy (Dillman, 2000).  To solicit 

participation from the U.S.-based telecommunications company, each participant 

received an introductory email from the Corporate Executive who oversees the 

department, informing individuals that they will receive an email from Purdue 

requesting their participation in this dissertation research. Due to the limited size 


30 

of the department (I was only granted permission to survey a single department 

in the telecommunications firm), I also surveyed employed leaders, drawn from a 

sample of alumni from a large public university.   

Supplementing the telecommunications company data with employed 

alumni leaders allowed me to examine my hypotheses with a more 

heterogeneous sample.  Narrowing the sample frame for alumni, I sought 

individuals with 10 or more years of experience post-graduation and who were 

identified as having mid-level to senior-level organizational leadership experience.  

These individuals represent multiple organizations across multiple industries, and 

therefore, have varied empowerment experiences.   To solicit participation from 

the alumni, each potential participant from the alumni database received an 

introductory email from me requesting their participation with my dissertation 

research.  A university database administrator agreed to send out an email 

solicitation to the alumni.  The administrator reported that due to invalid or 

inactive email addresses, a total of 3,610 out of 10,887 emails were received by 

alumni.   

The initial solicitation email provided to both samples (i.e., U.S.-based 

telecommunications company and alumni) included a unique link to the survey 

that was specifically tied to each respondent.  Each potential participant received 

a reminder email two weeks later (Dillman, 2000).  The solicitation emails 

included elements of a typical consent form necessitated by Purdueâs human 

subjectsâ research board (IRB Protocol #0906008138).  Specifically, each email 

contained information regarding the research being conducted, the voluntary 


31 

nature of the study, and the risks and benefits associated with participation.  

Additionally, all respondents were guaranteed complete confidentiality, and 

assured that their responses would be reported only in an aggregate (see 

Appendix A for communication provided to participants).  Considering that the 

nature of this study is to examine the multi-level effects of empowerment, I 

needed the participation of leaders and their subordinates to obtain meaningful 

results.  As such, I requested for the leaders from the alumni sample to provide 

the names and emails of their subordinates to also participate in the survey.  I 

explained in the letter that subordinates would complete similar questions as 

provided in the leader survey.  Furthermore, I confirmed that all responses 

provided would remain confidential.  This process was not warranted for the 

U.S.-based telecommunications company as I was provided an organizational 

chart and was able to seek the participation of the leaders and their subordinates 

directly and matched them appropriately. 

Subordinate solicitation for alumni was similar to leader solicitation; 

however, instead of sending out a mass email, I sent an individual email to each 

potential subordinate participant.  Subordinates, within their respective 

organizations, were provided with a unique identifier linking them to their 

respective leaders.  Implementing this strategy ensures that participants are 

accurately nested within their respective leader and organization.   

Three months after the initial survey, leaders from the U.S.-based 

telecommunications company and alumni received another email with a unique 

survey link requesting their assistance with providing creative performance and 


32 

OCB information for followers who completed the initial survey.  Following 

Dillmanâs (2000) recommendations, a reminder email was provided one week 

later.   

In sum, web-based surveys were sent to 3,629 leaders (19 for the U.S.-

based telecommunications company and 3,610 for alumni) and 438 subordinates 

(65 for the U.S.-based telecommunications company and 373 for alumni).  Of the 

leaders who received invitations to participate in this study, 8 leaders responded 

from the U.S.-based telecommunications company and 906 responded from 

alumni for a response rate of 42% and 25%, respectively.  After I deleted records 

without a leader-follower match, a total of 75 leaders (8 from telecommunications 

and 67 from alumni) and 188 subordinates (17 from telecommunications and 171 

from alumni) remained.  Of the 75 leaders, only 53 (5 from telecommunications 

and 48 from alumni) provided performance evaluations for their subordinates (9 

for telecommunications and 118 for alumni).  The overall response rate for 

subordinates is 43% as 188 (of the 438) subordinates were valid for this study.     

The 75 leader respondents comprised mostly of Caucasian (87%) males 

(77%).  Average age and tenure of the respondents were 50.54 years (S.D. = 

8.09) and 14.59 years (S.D. = 9.42), respectively.  Furthermore, 96% of these 

respondents had achieved a bachelorâs degree or higher.  For the 188 followers, 

respondents were predominantly Caucasian (80%) males (63%). Average age 

and tenure for subordinate respondents were 45.97 years (S.D. = 10.43) and 

10.52 years (S.D. = 8.96), respectively. Of these subordinates, 73% had a 

bachelorâs degree or higher.   


33 

I was able to capture demographic data for non-respondents to the survey 

and compare this data to those for respondents to check for evidence of non-

response bias.  For the leaders who were non-responsive to the initial invitation 

for participation, 81% were male with an average age of 56.07 years (S.D. = 

11.07).  A statistical comparison, t-tests, was performed for age and gender 

between the leader participants and non-respondents.  The results of the t-tests 

suggest that there was a significant difference in age between the leaders who 

participated in the study and those who chose not to participate, (t(76.5) = -5.08, 

p < 0.000).  Specifically, non-respondent leaders were, on average, older than 

the leaders who participated in the study. Therefore, non-response bias may be 

an issue for this study, and the results may be more applicable to younger 

(versus older) populations. 

 

3.2 Measures 

To minimize same source bias (i.e., artificially inflated correlations 

between variables), participants were assured that their individual responses 

would remain confidential and reported only in aggregate as a method to reduce 

evaluation apprehension (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003).  

Furthermore, many of my hypothesized relationships were examined from 

multiple sources.  For example, leaders assessed their political skill (LPS), 

leader-leader exchange (LLX), psychological empowerment (LEMP), as well as, 

their followerâs organizational citizenship behaviors (FOCB) and creative 

performance (FCP).  Followers assessed their leaderâs delegation (LDEL), close 


34 

supervision (LCS), and transformational leadership (TFL) behaviors, as well as, 

their psychological empowerment (FEMP) and their level of affective 

organizational commitment (FAOC).  Unless otherwise specified, all measures 

were rated on a 7-point Likert scale with anchors of 1 representing strongly 

disagree to 7 representing strongly agree. 

 

3.2.1 Leader 

Leader Political Skill (LPS).  Leaderâs rated their political skill using an 18-

item measure adapted from Ferris et al. (2005).  Sample items include âI am 

good at using my connections and network to make things happen at work.â and 

âI am particularly good at sensing the motivations and hidden agendas of others.â  

Cronbachâs alpha is 0.90. 

Leader-Leader Exchange (LLX).  To assess LLX, leaders completed an 8-

item measure adapted from Tangirala et al. (2007).  Each leader rated the quality 

of the upper dyadic relationship between the leader and his or her superior.  

Sample items are, âI usually know where I stand with my [superior's title].â and âI 

usually know how satisfied my [superior's title] is with me.â  Cronbachâs alpha is 

0.96. 

Leader Psychological Empowerment (LEMP).  Leaders self-rated their 

sense of empowerment with 12 items adapted from Spreitzer (1995b).  The four 

dimensions (i.e., meaning, impact, competence, and self-determination) were 

combined to form an overall measure of psychological empowerment.  Sample 


35 

items are, âI am confident about my ability to do my job.â and âI have significant 

autonomy in determining how I do my job.â  Cronbachâs alpha is 0.85. 

Leader Need for Power (LNFP).  Leaders self-rated their need for power 

using a 5-item measure adapted from Steers and Braunstein (1976).  Two items 

were removed to ensure stronger reliability results.  Sample items include, âI find 

myself organizing and directing the activities of others.â and âI strive to gain more 

control over the events around me at work.â Cronbachâs alpha is 0.68. 

Follower OCB (FOCB).   Leaders rated their followers OCB in a second 

survey provided 3 months after the initial survey.  Leaders completed a 16-item 

measure adapted from Lee and Allen, 2002.  Sample items are, My [follower]: 

âHelps others who have been absent.â and âKeeps up with the developments in 

the organization.â  Cronbachâs alpha is 0.93. 

Follower Creative Performance (FCP).  Leaders assessed their followerâs 

creativity in a second survey 3 months after the initial survey.  Leaders 

completed a 13-item creativity scale developed by George and Zhou (2001).  The 

scale for these items ranged from â1 = Not at all characteristicâ to â7 = Very 

characteristicâ.  Sample items include, âSuggests new ways to achieve goals or 

objectivesâ and âComes up with new and practical ideas to improve 

performance.â  Cronbachâs alpha is 0.96. 

 

3.2.2 Follower 

Delegation (LDEL).  Followers assessed their perception of the delegation 

they receive from their leaders.  Followers completed a 6-item delegation scale 


36 

based on two 3-item scales developed and validated by Schriesheim et al. 

(1998).  The 5-point scale responses ranged from â1 = None of the timeâ to â5 = 

Alwaysâ.  Sample items include, âMy department manager does not require that I 

get his or her input or approval before making decisions.â and â My department 

manager lets me make decisions for myself, without consulting him or her.â  

Cronbachâs alpha is 0.78. 

Close Supervision (LCS).  To assess their leaderâs level of close 

supervision, followers completed eight items adapted from George and Zhou 

(2001).  Sample items include, âIt sometimes feels like my department manager 

is always looking over my shoulder.â and âMy department manager keeps pretty 

close tabs on me.â  Cronbachâs alpha is 0.86. 

Transformational Leadership (TFL).  Followers rated their leaderâs 

transformational leadership behaviors using a 20-item measure adapted from 

Avolio and Bassâ (2004) Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQâForm 5X).  

The items measure the four dimensions of transformational leadership: idealized 

influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized 

consideration with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from â1 = Not At Allâ to â5 = 

Frequently, If Not Alwaysâ.  Since overall transformational leadership was tested 

in the current study, I averaged the 20 items to form an overall index. Complete 

list of items can be obtained from Mind Garden, Inc. Cronbachâs alpha is 0.96. 

Follower Psychological Empowerment (FEMP).  Similar to leaders, 

followers self-rated their sense of empowerment with 12 items adapted from 

Spreitzer (1995b).  Sample items are, âI am confident about my ability to do my 


37 

job.â and âI have significant autonomy in determining how I do my job.â  

Cronbachâs alpha is 0.88. 

Affective Organizational Commitment (FAOC).  Followerâs organizational 

commitment was assessed using 4 items from a scale developed by Allen and 

Meyer (1990).  Sample items are: âI would be very happy to spend the rest of my 

career with this organization.â, âI enjoy discussing my organization with people 

outside it.â, and  âI really feel as if this organizationâs problems are my own.â 

Cronbachâs alpha is 0.76. 

 

3.2.3 Control Variables 

Drawing upon prior research, there are several factors (such as gender, 

age, race, education, organizational tenure, role ambiguity, need for 

independence, or ability, experience, training, and knowledge) that may influence 

psychological empowerment, the key variable of my study.  See Appendix B for 

Role Ambiguity (RA), Need for Independence (NIND), and Ability, Experience, 

Training, and Knowledge (AETK) measures. 

 

3.2.3.1 Demographic Variables (Gender, Age, Race, & Education) 

 

I controlled for the demographic variables, gender, age, race, and 

education, as they are likely to be related to oneâs sense of empowerment 

(Koberg, Boss, Senjem, & Goodman, 1999; Seibert et al., 2011; Spreitzer, 

Kizilos, & Nason, 1997).  For example, women and certain members of minority 


38 

and ethnic groups may have a lower sense of empowerment as they typically 

have less representation in powerful positions within the organization (U.S. 

Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009).  I, therefore, expect that individuals who are 

non-Caucasian or female to have a lower sense of empowerment compared to 

individuals who are Caucasian or male.  Next, older employees may feel less 

empowered because they tend to be perceived as plateaued in the organization. 

Last, individuals with higher levels of education typically have more career 

mobility and, therefore, more likely to develop an identity with their work role.  

Consequently, individuals with higher levels of education are more likely to 

experience feelings of empowerment.  In sum, I controlled for these demographic 

variables to examine its impact on individual empowerment.  Gender was 

measured as â0 = male; 1 = femaleâ.  Age was measured in years.  

Race/ethnicity was measured as â1 = Caucasian; 2 = African-American; 3 = 

Asian; 4 = Hispanic; 5 = Otherâ.  Last, education was measured as â1 = High 

School or some college; 2 = Associates Degree; 3 = Bachelorâs Degree; 4 = 

Advanced Degreeâ. 

 

3.2.3.2 Organizational Tenure 

 

Next, as individuals gain more organizational tenure, they are able to 

adapt to different work situations and learn through various experiences (Koberg 

et al., 1999; Seibert et al., 2011).  As such, individuals are able to increase their 

sense of empowerment, and consequently, are better performers and able to 


have a positive impact on their workplace.  Therefore, organizational tenure 

(measured in years) was employed as a control in my regression analysis. 

39 

 

3.2.3.3 Role Ambiguity 

 

Another possible control variable is role ambiguity.  Research has shown 

that when individuals lack an understanding of the goals of their work unit and 

how their role fits within the organization, this reduces their sense of 

empowerment (Spreitzer, 1995a, 1996).  As such, I included role ambiguity as an 

additional control variable for my research.  Role ambiguity was assessed using 

5 items from a scale adapted from Rizzo, House, & Lirtzman (1970).  The 7-point 

Likert scale items ranged from â1 = Very Falseâ to â7 = Very Trueâ.  Sample items 

include, âI feel certain about how much authority I have.â and âThere are clear, 

planned goals and objectives for my job.â  Cronbachâs alpha is 0.90 (subordinate-

level) and 0.82 (leader-level). 

 

3.2.3.4 Substitutes for Leadership 

Previous empirical research suggests that two substitutes for leadership 

variables, ability, experience, training, and knowledge (AETK) and need for 

independence (NIND), as positively related to an individualâs intrinsic satisfaction 

with their work task (Podsakoff & MacKenzie, 1995; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & 

Bommer, 1996; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Fetter, 1993; Podsakoff, Niehoff, 

MacKenzie, & Williams, 1993).  As such, I included these variables as controls 


40 

with my regression analysis to examine their relationship with oneâs intrinsic 

motivation in their work role.  The Likert scale items ranged from â1 = Strongly 

Disagreeâ to â7 = Strongly Agreeâ.  For AETK, a 3-item scale described an 

individualâs ability, experience, training, and knowledge with performing their job 

responsibilities.  Sample items include, âI have the ability, experience, training or 

job knowledge to act independent of my department manager in performing my 

duties.â and âI have all the required ability and experience to be my own boss on 

my job.â  Cronbachâs alpha is 0.79 (subordinate-level) and 0.86 (leader-level).  

For NIND, a 3-item scale described an individualâs need for autonomy within their 

work role.  Sample items include, âIt is important for me to be able to feel that I 

can do my job without depending on others.â and âI prefer to solve my work 

problems myself.â  Cronbachâs alpha is 0.88 (subordinate-level) and 0.82 (leader-

level).   

  

3.3 Analytical Approach and Methods 

3.3.1 Aggregation 

Consistent with previous research for transformational leadership (Avolio 

et al., 2004; Bono & Judge, 2003; Jung & Sosik, 2002; Kark, Shamir, & Chen, 

2003; Spreitzer et al., 1999) and to address the hypothesized questions in this 

study, delegation, close supervision and transformational leadership were treated 

as group-level variablesâgrouped by leader.  As such, a direct consensus 

composition model was employed for this study to ensure adequate within group 

agreement among followers tied to a particular leader (D. Chan, 1998).  To 


41 

determine the level of within-group agreement, I examined rwg(j) and the 

intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) as measures of interrater reliability and 

agreement which are metrics for assessing aggregation. 

In the present study, group reflects the followers for each respective 

leader.  To determine the level of within-group homogeneity, James and 

associates developed the rwg(j) statistic (James, Demaree, & Wolf, 1984). The 

rwg(j) has values ranging from 0.00 to 1.00.  If rwg(j) is equal to or greater 

than .70, then there is sufficient within-group agreement.  The rwg(j)âs for 

delegation, close supervision, and transformational leadership were 0.80, 0.83, 

and 0.91, respectively (using uniform distribution) indicating adequate agreement 

for aggregation (Bliese, 2000; LeBreton & Senter, 2008).  

To further assess homogeneity, I conducted a one-way ANOVA and 

calculated the ICCs.  The intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC(1), indicates the 

proportion of variance in individual responses explained by group membership 

(Bliese, 2000). The ICC(1) has values that range from 0.0 to 1.00.  Typical ICC(1) 

values range from 0.0 to 0.5, with a median value of 0.12 (James, 1982).  The 

ICC(1)s for delegation, close supervision, and transformational leadership were 

0.34 (F = 2.05, p < 0.006), 0.48 (F = 2.82, p < 0.000), and 0.51 (F = 3.11, p < 

0.000), respectively.  The magnitude of these correlations suggests that leaders 

exerted a sizeable influence on subordinate ratings (LeBreton & Senter, 2008). 

 


42 

3.3.2 SPSS 

To ensure the appropriate level of analysis for variables with different 

metrics (i.e., 5-point versus 7-point Likert scales), standardized mean scores (z-

scores) were calculated for each measure examined in this study.  Furthermore, 

the direct/main effects within the leader level were conducted with OLS 

regression using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).  SPSS 

(also known as IBM SPSS through a recent acquisition) is a widely used program 

for statistical analysis across various social science disciplines.  This statistical 

application was utilized to examine the relationships for Hypotheses 1 â 2.      

 

3.3.3 Multi-level Effects 

Due to the hierarchical nature of our data and the likelihood that some 

leaders are tied to more than one subordinate, I needed to employ a method that 

would control for the interdependence between leaders.  Hierarchical linear 

modeling (HLM) assist with this analysis by enabling the control of Level 1 

relationships where Level 1 variables are tied to the same Level 2 group.  

Therefore, the examination of Hypotheses 3 and 4 were tested with OLS and 

HLM methods using the guidelines suggested by Mathieu and Taylor (2007).  

HLM was also utilized to examine Hypothesis 5 which sought to assess leader 

effects on subordinate behaviors and attitudes.


43 

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS 

4.1 Descriptive Statistics 

All descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations for relevant variables 

are available in Table 1 (subordinate-level) and Table 2 (leader-level).  Age, role 

ambiguity (RA), and ability, experience, training & knowledge (AETK), were 

significantly related to my key variable of interest, empowerment, and therefore, 

were included as statistical control variables in my analysis. 

At the completion of data collection and prior to my hypothesis testing, t-

tests were performed between the U.S.-based telecommunications and alumni 

samples for leaders and subordinates.  With the exception of need for 

independence (t(73) = 2.04, p < 0.05), the results of the t-test for leaders 

revealed that there were no significant differences between settings.  Leaders at 

the U.S.-based telecommunications company (M = 5.08, SD = 1.02) on average 

had a higher need for independence than leaders obtained from the alumni 

sample (M = 4.09, SD = 1.33).  

The results of the t-tests for followers revealed similar results; however, 

there were differences with ability, experience, training, and knowledge (t(96) = 

2.53, p < 0.03), need for independence (t(26.62) = 3.86, p < 0.001), tenure (t(96) 

= 2.12, p < 0.04), and education (t(88) = 5.21, p < 0.000) among followers.  


44 

Specifically, followers at the U.S.-based telecommunications company, on 

average, had a higher ability, experience, training, and knowledge (M = 6.67, SD 

= 0.47), need for independence (M = 5.70, SD = 0.45), tenure (M = 16.44, SD = 

6.89), and education (M = 1.00, SD = 0.00) than alumnae followers (M = 6.10, 

SD = 0.73), (M = 4.90, SD = 1.35), (M = 9.92, SD = 8.95) and (M = 0.76, SD = 

0.43), respectively.   

I also performed a confirmatory factor analysis to examine the fit for 

several models.  First, I examined the fit between a three-factor and one-factor 

model for the predictors of leader empowerment.  As shown in Table 19, the 

three-factor model demonstrated better fit when compared to the one-factor 

model Ï2 (N=75) = 200.43; df = 101; Ï2/df= 1.98; IFI = 0.88; CFI = 0.87; RMSEA 

= 0.12 (0.09, 0.14).  Next, I examined the fit between a four-factor and one-factor 

model for the outcomes of leader empowerment.  As shown in Table 20, the four-

factor model demonstrated better fit when compared to the one-factor model Ï2 

(N=75) = 564.66; df = 224; Ï2/df= 2.52; IFI = 0.73; CFI = 0.72; RMSEA = 0.14 

(0.13, 0.16).  Last, I examined the fit between a four-factor and one-factor model 

for the outcomes of follower empowerment.  As shown in Table 21, the four-

factor model demonstrated better fit when compared to the one-factor model Ï2 

(N=188) = 1534.07; df = 623; Ï2/df= 2.46; IFI = 0.76; CFI = 0.76; RMSEA = 0.09 

(0.08, 0.09).  In sum, the confirmatory factor analysis provided support for 

keeping the hypothesized variables as distinct constructs. 

The following section discusses the results of my hypothesis testing. 

 


45 

4.2 Hypothesis Testing 

Hypothesis 1 predicted that leader-leader exchange will be positively 

associated with leader psychological empowerment.  As shown in Table 3, 

leader-leader exchange is not significantly associated with leader psychological 

empowerment (B = -0.07, ns).  Consequently, Hypothesis 1 is not supported. 

Hypothesis 2 predicted that leader political skill will be positively 

associated with leader psychological empowerment.  As shown in Table 3, leader 

political skill is significantly associated with leader psychological empowerment 

(B = 0.40, p < 0.000), thereby, supporting Hypothesis 2. 

Hypothesis 3 predicted that the positive relationship between leader 

psychological empowerment and follower psychological empowerment will be 

mediated by delegation (3A), close supervision (3B), and transformational 

leadership (3C).  As shown in Table 4, leader psychological empowerment (É£01 = 

0.16, p < 0.10) (marginally), delegation (É£01 = 0.15, p < 0.05) (significantly), and 

close supervision (É£01 = -0.16, p < 0.05) (significantly) are related to follower 

psychological empowerment; transformational leadership, however, is not 

supported (É£01 = 0.12, ns).  Although these findings fulfill the X (cid:1) Y and M (cid:1) Y 

requirements for mediation, X (cid:1) M, however, is not supported.  As demonstrated 

in Table 6, leader psychological empowerment is not associated with delegation 

(B = -0.09, ns), close supervision (B = 0.09, ns), and transformational leadership 

(B = -0.02, ns).  Consequently, Hypotheses 3A, 3B, and 3C are not supported.  

Interestingly, the associations between leader psychological empowerment and 

leader behavioral outcomes (i.e., delegation, close supervision, and 


46 

transformational leadership) in the regression analysis are contrary to the 

associations revealed with the zero-order correlations.  This suggests that 

systematic variance or bias is associated with the leader behavioral outcomes 

when examining these relationships with control variables (i.e., leader age, role 

ambiguity, and ability, experience, training, and knowledge) that are not present 

with the examination of other leader level relationships. 

Hypothesis 4 predicted that the leaderâs need for power will moderate the 

indirect relationship between leader psychological empowerment and follower 

psychological empowerment.  As shown in Tables 5 and 6, the interactive effects 

between leader need for power and leader psychological empowerment is not 

significantly associated with delegation (B = -0.09, ns), close supervision (B =      

-0.01, ns), transformational leadership (B = 0.09, ns), and follower psychological 

empowerment (É£01 = -0.05, ns).  Therefore, Hypothesis 4 receives no support. 

Hypothesis 5 predicted that follower psychological empowerment will be 

positively related to follower OCB (5A), follower creative performance (5B), and 

follower affective organizational commitment (5C).  To test for Hypothesis 5, 

random coefficient regression methods were used to control for the 

interdependence across leaders.  As demonstrated in Table 7, follower 

psychological empowerment is positively associated with follower OCB (É£01 = 

0.40, p < 0.001), follower creative performance (É£01 = 0.30, p < 0.05), and 

follower affective organizational commitment (É£01 = 0.53, p < 0.001).  Accordingly, 

Hypotheses 5A, 5B, and 5C are supported. 

 


47 

4.3 Post Hoc Analyses 

4.3.1 Curvilinear Relationships 

 

Although not hypothesized, I investigated the potential of curvilinear 

relationships to explain the lack of support for Hypotheses 1 and 3.  As 

demonstrated in Table 8, statistically significant effects were found for the 

quadratic term for leader-leader exchange predicting leader psychological 

empowerment (B = 0.25, p < 0.01) suggesting the relationship between leader-

leader exchange and leader psychological empowerment is non-linear.  As 

demonstrated in Figure 3, the graph reveals a U-shape relationship with an 

inflection point (i.e., the point where the slope transitions from negative to 

positive) occurring at (-0.76, -0.39).  

 

For Hypothesis 3, curvilinear effects were not supported for the 

relationships between leader psychological empowerment and delegation (B = -

0.04, ns) and leader psychological empowerment and transformational 

leadership (B = 0.06, ns), however, there may be a curvilinear relationship 

between leader psychological empowerment and close supervision (B = 0.17, 

one-tailed p < 0.10) (see Table 9 and Figure 4). 

 

4.3.2 Cross-Level Mediation 

To compliment current data analysis, I also examined follower 

empowerment as an intervening mechanism between leader behavioral 

outcomes and follower attitudes and behaviors.  As previously demonstrated in 

Table 4, delegation (É£01 = 0.15, p < 0.05) (significantly), and close supervision 


48 

(É£01 = -0.16, p < 0.05) (significantly) are related to follower psychological 

empowerment; transformational leadership, however, is not supported (É£01 = 0.12, 

ns).  Thus, for delegation and close supervision, the X (cid:1) M relationship required 

for mediation are met.  The M (cid:1) Y mediation requirements are also fulfilled as 

follower psychological empowerment is significantly related to follower 

organizational citizenship behaviors (É£01 = 0.40, p < 0.001; see Table 7), follower 

creative performance (É£01 = 0.30, p < 0.05; see Table 7), and follower affective 

organizational commitment (É£01 = 0.53, p < 0.001; see Table 7).  Furthermore, as 

demonstrated in Tables 10-18, the X (cid:1) Y requirements for mediation are fulfilled 

for delegation (É£01 = 0.38, p < 0.001; see Table 10) and close supervision (É£01 =   

-0.26, p < 0.05; see Table 11) with follower organizational citizenship behaviors, 

delegation (É£01 = 0.48, p < 0.001; see Table 13) and close supervision (É£01 =        

-0.35, p < 0.01; see Table 14) with follower creative performance, and delegation 

(É£01 = 0.14, p < 0.10; see Table 16) and transformational leadership (É£01 = 0.24, p 

< 0.01; see Table 18) with follower affective commitment.  Last, the X (cid:1) Y 

relationship is reduced when the mediator, follower psychological empowerment, 

is added as a control for delegation (É£01 = 0.29, p < 0.05; see Table 10) and close 

supervision (É£01 = -0.15, ns; see Table 11) with follower organizational citizenship 

behaviors, delegation (É£01 = 0.38, p < 0.01; see Table 13) and close supervision 

(É£01 = -0.25, p < 0.05; see Table 14) with follower creative performance, and 

delegation (É£01 = 0.03, ns; see Table 16) and transformational leadership (É£01 = 

0.12, p < 0.10; see Table 18) with follower affective commitment.  These findings 

suggest the presence of mediation, particularly, that follower psychological 


49 

empowerment may be an intervening mechanism between the leader behavioral 

outcomes of delegation, close supervision, and transformational leadership with 

follower organizational citizenship behaviors, follower creative performance, and 

follower affective organizational commitment.   


50 

 

CHAPTER 5 DISCUSSION 

There are two main purposes of this research.  First, I sought to examine 

the potential drivers of leader psychological empowerment.  Specifically, I 

examined the quality of the upper dyadic relationship the leader has with his/her 

superior (LLX) and the leaderâs political skill as antecedents of the leaderâs level 

of psychological empowerment.  Second, I sought to understand whether a 

positive association existed between leader and subordinate empowerment, and 

what leader behavior mechanisms may explain this relationship.  To address this 

question, the examination of delegation, close supervision, and transformational 

leadership were employed as potential intervening behaviors that may facilitate 

the leader-subordinate empowerment relationship.   

The novelty of this study is that it begins to address these questions within 

a multi-level framework of empowerment.  As demonstrated in Figure 1, prior 

studies on both leader empowerment and employee empowerment have 

implemented a within-level examination of psychological empowerment.  

Particularly, studies have examined the drivers and outcomes that drive 

individual empowerment.  Although there are a few multi-level studies examining 

empowerment, a multi-level examination linking the psychological empowerment 

of leaders and their subordinates, to my knowledge, has not been explored.  By 


51 

conducting a multi-level approach, this study was able to jointly consider 

empowerment antecedents for both a leader as well as antecedents for the 

leaderâs followers, including the leaderâs psychological empowerment, thereby, 

contributing to the management literature. I draw upon the leadership and 

motivation frameworks to understand the drivers and outcomes of leader 

psychological empowerment and how they influence subordinate empowerment.  

Thus, this multi-level examination extends our understanding of follower 

empowerment while also providing a broader perspective regarding the 

empowerment of leaders. 

 

Antecedents of Leader Empowerment 

In terms of antecedents to leader empowerment, I found, contrary to my 

expectations, that LLX was not linearly associated with leader psychological 

empowerment.   This finding was surprising because prior studies have 

demonstrated a positive linear association between LMX and individual 

psychological empowerment (Aryee & Chen, 2006; G. Chen et al., 2007; G. 

Chen & Klimoski, 2003; Liden et al., 2000; Spreitzer, 2007; Wat & Shaffer, 2005).    

LLX as a construct, extends LMX up the leadership hierarchy.  Thus, I sought to 

extend the LMX linkage to empowerment to higher upper-dyadic relationships.   If 

leaders, by nature of their position, are instrumental for driving organizational 

results, I would have expected the relationship developed between leaders and 

their superiors to be influential in forming the focal leaderâs perceptions of 

empowerment and their ability to accomplish their tasks (i.e., meaning, 


52 

competence, impact, and self-determination).  Instead, LLX was linearly 

unrelated to leader empowerment.   As the quality of the relationship between a 

leader and his/her leader increases, there is not a linear associated increase in 

leader empowerment.  

There are several potential explanations for this unexpected finding.  First, 

it may be that there are other things that are more important in sustaining 

empowerment as individuals move up the organizational hierarchy.  At lower 

levels, quality exchanges are empowering.  At higher levels, relationship quality 

may diminish in its importance as a predictor of empowerment.  It may be that as 

leaders move up in the organizational hierarchy, there are factors, other than 

oneâs relationship with oneâs superior that may explain oneâs sense of 

empowerment. One such factor may be the design or characteristics of the job 

itself.  For example, extending Hackman and Oldhamâs (1976) work on job 

design, Kraimer et al. (1999) found that empowerment meaning was positively 

associated with job meaningfulness, empowerment self-determination was 

positively associated with job autonomy, and empowerment impact and 

competence were positively associated with task feedback (Hackman & Oldham, 

1976; Kraimer et al., 1999; Spreitzer, 2007).  As leaders move up within the 

organizational hierarchy, the nature of the work itself may play a more prevalent 

role in shaping empowerment perceptions.   

Second, it may be that leaders value more social-structural factors (i.e., 

access to opportunity, information, support, and resources) as they move higher 

in the organizational hierarchy.  For instance, Spreitzer (1996) found that 


53 

individuals who were in units with wider spans of control and performance-based 

pay reported having higher levels of psychological empowerment (Spreitzer, 

1996, 2007).  This notion may also extend to leaders who experience wider 

spans of control and better compensation with their work roles and associated 

responsibilities.   In sum, future research is needed to examine additional factors 

that may influence a leaderâs sense of empowerment. 

Third, our assumption that the relationship between LLX and leader 

empowerment is linear may not be true.  Indeed, post-hoc analysis revealed the 

presence of a curvilinear relationship between LLX and leader empowerment 

such that leader psychological empowerment is high when he/she has an 

extremely low-quality or high-quality relationship with his/her superior and is low 

when a moderate-quality relationship is present.  An explanation of why this may 

occur could be that when there is a low-quality relationship, leaders may perceive 

to have more personal control.  Personal control is the perception of having more 

discretion over work behaviors and influence over important work outcomes 

(Brockner, Spreitzer, Mishra, Hochwater, Pepper, & Weinberg,  2004; Spreitzer, 

1995b; Tangirala & Ramanujam, 2008).  Leaders, without the influence of their 

superiors, may perceive themselves as being the origins of their actions and not 

feel that they are just following the orders of their superior, and therefore, having 

a higher sense if influence with achieving organizational goals (Spreitzer et al., 

1997).  As the social exchange relationship between the leader and his/her 

superior improves, the leaderâs sense of empowerment reduces as he/she may 

initially perceive they lack control over work-related decisions due to the 


54 

involvement of their superior.  However, with the continuance towards a high-

quality relationship, the leader realizes better job latitude, decision making 

authority and access to resources as he/she becomes part of their superiorâs in-

group (Dienesch & Liden, 1986; Graen et al., 1977; Tangirala et al., 2007), which 

in turn, increases his/her sense of empowerment.  Future research is required to 

further explore the curvilinear relationship between LLX and leader 

empowerment.  

Last, empowerment has traditionally been perceived as a cognitive 

orientation that one has towards their work role.  Although, this approach for 

understanding individual behaviors is predominant, it is devoid of an affective 

component that may play an empowering role.  For instance, the quality of the 

upper dyadic relationship between leaders and their superiors may impact oneâs 

empowerment through the affective connection that is shared between the leader 

and his or her superior.  Future research is needed to examine the combined 

cognitive and affective components of psychological empowerment.   

In addition to LLX, I examined political skill as an antecedent to leader 

empowerment.   Leaders who are politically skilled have the ability to control 

people and situations with minimum effort, build social capital and strategic 

alliances, obtain scarce resources for their followers, organizational rewards, and 

achieve higher organizational status and reputation (Ferris, 2005; Treadway et 

al., 2004).  Indeed, and in support of my prediction, leader political skill was 

positively related to leader psychological empowerment.  In sum these findings 

provide some interesting insights regarding the curvilinear effects of LLX and 


linear effects of leader political skill as drivers that may facilitate a leader being 

psychologically empowered. I will now discuss the impact that leader 

psychological empowerment has on followers, particularly, follower psychological 

55 

empowerment. 

 

Consequences of Leader Empowerment 

With a multilevel design, I was able to examine the effects of leader 

empowerment on subordinate empowerment.  My findings suggest that leader 

empowerment is necessary for followers to be empowered; however, the 

intervening factors necessary to facilitate that relationship remain unclear.  I 

examined three potential intervening factors - delegation, close supervision, and 

transformational leadership behaviors. However, these variables did not mediate 

the relationship between leader empowerment and follower empowerment as I 

had theorized. Furthermore, a leaderâs need for power did not moderate the 

leader empowerment to leader behavior relationships (i.e., delegation, close 

supervision, and transformational leadership). 

Interestingly, although leader empowerment was unrelated to leader 

behaviors, the leader behaviors themselves may have an effect on follower 

psychological empowerment.  I found that delegation (positively) and close 

supervision (negatively) were related to follower psychological empowerment.  

These findings suggests that when leaders engage in behaviors that enable their 

subordinates to acquire expanded skills, autonomy, and increased responsibility, 

as well as, when they engage in less controlling micro-managing behaviors, 


56 

subordinates in turn, have a higher sense of meaning, competence, self-

determination, and impact with their work roles.  Future research should further 

examine these relationships and other leader behaviors that may impact a 

subordinateâs level of empowerment. 

I also examined the possibility (post hoc) that the relationships between 

leader empowerment and leader behavior are curvilinear.  Interestingly, I found 

that leader psychological empowerment may have a curvilinear relationship with 

close supervision.  Particularly, when a leader has an extreme low or high level 

of empowerment, he/she engages in more close supervision behaviors.  Leaders 

are least likely to engage in close supervision behaviors when they have a 

moderate level of psychological empowerment.  A potential explanation for this 

finding may be that when a leader has a low level of empowerment, he/she may 

not be concerned with the development of their subordinates; only the completion 

of the work itself.  Therefore, the leader may engage in more micro-managing 

behaviors as an attempt to maintain control of their subordinatesâ behaviors for 

work related tasks (George & Zhou, 2001; Ryan & Grolnick, 1986; Tetrick, 1989; 

Zhou, 2003).  As the leaderâs sense of empowerment increases, he/she engages 

in less close supervision, however, interestingly, the leader returns to engaging in 

more close supervision behaviors as his/her level of empowerment increases.  

Perhaps, empowered leaders, due their aspirations to develop their subordinates 

will engage in more micro-managing behaviors to monitor the progress of their 

subordinates.  The curvilinear effect of leader empowerment on close should be 

examined further in future research. 


57 

Although the intervening factors between leader empowerment and 

subordinate empowerment remain ambiguous, I did find that empowered 

subordinates engage in greater citizenship and creative behaviors, and 

experience greater affective attachment to their organization.  These findings are 

consistent with previous empirical studies and intrinsic theories of motivation and 

suggest that empowered employees engage in discretionary behaviors and hold 

positive attitudes that are beneficial to their organization. 

Given these findings, and the relationship of leader behaviors to 

subordinate empowerment, I examined whether subordinate empowerment might 

mediate the relationship between leader behavior and employee outcomes.  With 

the post hoc analysis, I found that follower psychological empowerment may 

mediate the relationship between leader behavioral outcomes (i.e., delegation, 

close supervision, and transformational leadership) and follower outcomes (i.e., 

organizational citizenship behaviors, creative performance, and affective 

organizational commitment).  Future research should further examine these 

relationships and other variables that may facilitate these indirect relationships. 

I investigated empowerment in a practical setting where empowerment is 

important for individual and organizational outcomes.  As organizations recognize 

the benefits of empowered employees, they often seek to understand the drivers 

and outcomes of employee behaviors and attitudes (Avery, McKay, & Wilson, 

2007; Harter, Schmidt, & Hayes, 2002).  This leader empowerment study allows 

organizations to specifically understand the factors that contribute to their 

leadersâ sense of meaning, competence, impact, and self-determination 


regarding their work role.  Furthermore, the findings of this study suggest that the 

leaderâs level of empowerment is empowering for subordinates. 

58 

 

Future Research and Limitations 

Although this study extends our understanding of leader empowerment, 

there are limitations of this study that offer opportunities for future research.  

First, I chose to focus on leaders due to their role with achieving organizational 

goals.  As such, leaders of this study ranged from mid-level to senior-level 

individuals within organizations.  As leaders move up within the organizational 

hierarchy, their roles and responsibilities associated with their position will 

expand and vary.  With such variability in role and responsibilities, drivers and 

outcomes of leader empowerment may also vary with each hierarchical level.  

Future research should focus on either mid-level or senior-level leaders to ensure 

an in-depth understanding surrounding a leaderâs sense of psychological 

empowerment. 

Second, I employed a cross-sectional design to conduct this research.  

Thus, I cannot claim to test causal relationships.  Future research should 

consider using a longitudinal design to better ascertain causality in these 

processes.  Although I employed a cross-sectional design, my study, however, 

provided some interesting findings extending current leadership and motivation 

theory. To begin, I drew upon LMX theory to investigate how upper dyadic 

relationships facilitate a leader being intrinsically motivated.  The results of my 

study suggests that, contrary to previous findings, as leaders move up in the 


59 

organizational hierarchy, there is a curvilinear, rather than linear, relationship that 

exists between LLX and leader empowerment.   Leaders are most empowered 

when they have either a low- or high-quality upper dyadic relationship with their 

superior.  Next, drawing upon the political skill framework, I found that the 

leaderâs sense of empowerment is also influenced by his or her ability to 

influence others, build strategic alliances, and obtain scare resources.  Although 

research has supported the importance of political skill within organizations, this 

study extends that knowledge revealing that leaders who are politically savvy 

also have a higher sense meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact 

regarding their work, rather than leaders who lack political skill. LLX (curvilinear) 

and leader political skill offers new perspectives with organizational leadership.  

Particularly, they address how the nature of social interactions (i.e., those with a 

superior or those internal and external to the organization) as intrinsically 

motivating for leaders.  Last, as previously discussed, research has examined 

numerous factors that influence a subordinateâs sense of empowerment. I, 

however, extend that knowledge by demonstrating that leader psychological 

empowerment is another factor that also may influence a subordinateâs sense of 

psychological empowerment.  Collectively, the questions and results presented in 

this study uncover contextual and individual attributes which expands our 

knowledge regarding leadership, their relationships, and skills needed to 

accomplish organizational goals.  Nevertheless, future research is warranted to 

understand how these relationships develop with a longitudinal design. 


60 

Third, to conduct a multi-level empowerment study, an adequate sample 

size is needed to ensure sufficient power to detect significant findings that exist in 

the population.  Although, some of my hypothesized relationships were 

significant, many of my hypotheses were not supported.  A larger sample size 

may address this issue by ensuring sufficient power to detect the hypothesized 

relationships.  Accordingly, future research is needed to examine these 

hypothesized relationships with a larger sample. 

Finally, leaders for this study reported having uniformly high levels of 

psychological empowerment with minimal variability (see Table 2).  This 

uniformity may be due to the minimal variability of empowerment for holders of 

advanced degrees and/or higher positions of leadership, and therefore, leaders 

may have similarly positive perceptions regarding their sense of empowerment.  

Furthermore, the experiences acquired in their respective industries may have 

provided the leaders with more opportunities for growth and leadership 

experiences, thereby, contributing to their sense of empowerment.  That is, as 

leaders progress up the organizational hierarchy, it may be because they are 

empowered.  Thus, there could be a restriction in range in our study on leader 

empowerment.  Future studies should incorporate samples that include not only 

currently successful leaders but perhaps leaders on the path to derailment.  In 

sum, the restriction in range, or lack of variance, in leader empowerment may 

have suppressed the relationships examined in this study.  

 

 


61 

Implications 

In closing, several implications for leadership and motivation can be 

gleaned from my research.  First, this work underlies the importance that as 

individuals move up within the organization, they are empowered by different 

factors than lower level individuals.  Particularly, I find that leaders are 

curvilinearly empowered by the upper dyadic relationship he/she shares with 

his/her superior (LLX).  This implies that regardless of whether the leader has a 

low- or high-quality relationship with his or her superior, which influences the 

leader being a part of their superiorâs in-group or out-group, the leader is able to 

have a high level of intrinsic motivation to conduct their work responsibilities.   

Furthermore, I find that leaders are empowered by their ability to build a social 

network and influence others (i.e., politically skilled) to achieve organizational 

goals.  This implies that leader intrinsic motivation is also contingent upon their 

ability to manage others perception of them as leaders.  Finally, empowered 

leaders are necessary to facilitate empowerment of their followers.  Therefore, as 

organizations seek to improve organizational performance, they must first begin 

at the higher hierarchy within the organization.  Specifically, organizations must 

ensure that the proper mechanisms are available to intrinsically motivate their 

leaders, which in turn, will facilitate how they engage their followers to stimulate 

their level of psychological empowerment.  Empowered leaders will affect the 

level of involvement followers implement to perform their work responsibilities.

A few weeks ago you received a notice from [LEADER], [TITLE] requesting your 
participation in a research project we are conducting.  As such, we are writing to 
ask you, along with other employees within [DIVISION], to help us in a study on 
Leader Empowerment being conducted by researchers at the Krannert School 
of Management at Purdue University. Your role in this research is to provide your 
input by completing the survey linked below and potentially a follow up 
survey.  Only participants with direct reports will receive a follow up survey within 
2 to 3 months.  Our research will enable us to examine how a leaderâs sense of 
empowerment translates into leader behaviors and employee effectiveness.  This 
study will offer unique insights on how leaders can work more effectively.  
  
This study is for research purposes only.  Only researchers from Purdue will 
have access to your individual responses.  Your responses to this survey are 
strictly confidential. No one from your organization will see your responses. 
Findings from this research will be released only to your division as a summary in 
which no individualâs answers can be identified.  Pre-assigned key codes, not 
names, will be used to match participants to their leaders and direct reports. This 
survey is voluntary.  However, you can help us very much by taking some time to 
share your opinions with us.  The survey will take approximately 20 minutes to 
complete.  You can access the online survey (from any internet connection) by 
clicking the link below:

We would be grateful if we could receive your completed survey no later than 
[DUE DATE]. 
  
Through this study, you will help Purdue maintain its prominent role in the 
development of future leaders. As an additional benefit, the knowledge generated 
from this research will be shared with your organization. This research will 
provide a better understanding of the factors that contribute to a leaderâs sense 
of empowerment.  Moreover, this research will explore the consequences of 
leader empowerment in terms of leader behaviors, as well as, followerâs 
performance and organizational commitment.
