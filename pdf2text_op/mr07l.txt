Leadership

The Impact of Goal Orientation on the
Association between Leadership Style and
Follower Performance, Creativity and Work
Attitudes
Simon A. Moss and Damian A. Ritossa, Monash University, Australia

Abstract This study examines whether goal orientation – which refers to whether
individuals  strive  to  learn  skills,  attract  favourable  evaluations,  or  minimize
unfavourable judgments – inﬂuences whether transformational leadership improves
employee performance, creativity and work attitudes. A sample of 263 employees
completed  a  questionnaire  in  which  they  assessed  their  own  goal  orientation  and
commitment, as well as evaluated the leadership style of their supervisor. Moreover,
these supervisors appraised the performance and creativity of their employees. The
ﬁndings  revealed  that  a  learning  orientation  magniﬁed  the  beneﬁts  of contingent
reward  –  in  which  leaders  provide  clear  incentives  to  motivate  employees  –  on
normative  commitment.  Furthermore,  when  employees  endeavoured  to  attract
favourable evaluations, intellectual stimulation was more likely to foster normative
commitment. Finally, when employees endeavored to minimize unfavourable judg-
ments, inspirational motivation diminished affective commitment to the organization.
These ﬁndings suggest the goal orientation of employees should be optimized before
plans to encourage transformational leadership are instituted.

Introduction

Since the early 1930s, leadership has remained a ubiquitous topic of exploration in
the  ﬁeld  of  psychology,  despite  a  modest  decline  in  the  1970s  (Hunt,  1999). The
popularity of this topic was restored with the advent of concepts such as charismatic
leadership  (e.g.  Conger  and  Kanungo,  1987;  House,  1977;  Shamir  et  al.,  1993),
visionary leadership (e.g. Bennis and Nanus, 1985; Kouzes and Posner, 1987) and
transformational leadership (Bass, 1985). All of these advances emphasize that some
leaders can inspire followers to pursue collective values and aspirations as well as
sacriﬁce  egocentric  needs  and  goals.  These  theories  also  reveal  that  leaders  can
invoke and regulate emotions – rather than rely on rational processes – to motivate
other individuals.

Perhaps the most prominent of these advances was proposed by Bass (1985). This
framework  distinguishes  between  transformational  leadership,  in  which  leaders
elevate the goals and promote the morality of followers, and transactional leadership,
in  which  leaders  offer  incentives  to  encourage  individuals  to  realize  their  extant
goals. This distinction was ﬁrst uncovered by Burns (1978) through an examination
of political leaders, but was reﬁned by Bass (1985) who regarded transformational
and  transactional  leadership  as  behaviours  that  were  not  necessarily  mutually
exclusive.

Transformational and transactional leadership

Bass and Avolio (1990, 1994,1997) identiﬁed four distinct but related facets of
transformational leadership. First, individualized consideration refers to the extent
to which leaders provide mentoring and coaching, regard followers as individuals,
and adapt their support to accommodate the unique needs and concerns of each
person (Yammarino  et  al., 1993). Second, intellectual stimulation refers to the
degree to which leaders encourage follows to challenge extant assumptions,
consider traditional problems through a novel perspective, and introduce inno-
vative suggestions. Third,
to which
leaders present an arousing vision that underscores the importance of various
work tasks, promotes a sense of cohesion and collective purpose, and boosts conﬁ-
dence as well as expectations (Martin and Epitropaki, 2001). Finally, idealized
inﬂuence characterizes the degree to which leaders are perceived as an inspiring role
model  through  their  personal  accomplishments,  character,  and  behaviour.  Two
forms have been distinguished: idealized attributes in which leaders receive trust as
well as respect, and idealized behaviour in which leaders demonstrate exemplary
behaviour  and  might  sacriﬁce  their  own  needs  to  advance  the  objectives  of  their
workgroup.

inspiration motivation depicts the extent

Bass  and  Avolio  (1990,  1997)  also  distinguished  three  forms  of  transactional
behaviour in which leaders encourage followers merely to realize rather than trans-
form their own goals and values. First, contingent reward describes the provision of
incentives,  such  as  bonuses,  to  encourage  followers  to  realize  speciﬁc  goals.
Although traditionally considered a transactional behaviour, contingent reward tends
to coincide with transformational leadership and success (see: Barling et al., 2000;
Bycio et al., 1995; Carless, 1998; Coad and Berry, 1998; Palmer et al., 2001; Sosik
and Megerian, 1999; Tejeda et al., 2001; Tepper and Percy, 1994). Second, active
management  by  exception  refers  to  the  extent  to  which  leaders  actively  strive  to
identify, and then redress, shortfalls or errors. Third, passive management by excep-
tion  describes  leaders  who  shun  involvement  until  these  shortfalls  or  errors  arise.
Finally, Bass and Avolio (1997) applied the term laissez-faire management to depict
leaders who demonstrate a passive indifference towards their followers.

A multitude of studies have substantiated the beneﬁts of transformational leader-
ship,  at  least  compared  to  management  by  exception  or  laissez-faire.  Speciﬁcally,
transformational  leadership  has  been  demonstrated  to  promote  various  facets  of
performance, as manifested by ﬁnancial indices, sales, productivity, quality and other
measures (e.g. Avolio et al., 1988; Barling et al., 1996; Carless et al., 1995; Geyer
and Steyrer, 1998; Hater and Bass, 1988; Howell and Avolio, 1993; McColl-Kennedy

and  Anderson,  2002;  Yammarino  and  Bass,  1990).  In  addition,  transformational
leadership  has  been  shown  to  promote  creativity  and  innovation  in  teams  and
individuals (e.g. Jung, 2001; Keller, 1992; Shin and Zhou, 2003; Sosik, 1997; Sosik
et al., 1998). Finally, transformational leadership also improves work attitudes, such
as trust, job satisfaction and commitment (Barling et al., 1996; Bycio et al., 1995;
Den  Hartog,  1997;  Dubinsky  et  al.,  1995;  George  and  Jones,  1997;  Martin  and
Epitropaki, 2001; Podsakoff et al., 1996; Sparks and Schenk, 2001; Staw et al., 1994;
Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996; Yammarino and Bass, 1990).

Factors that affect the utility of transformational leadership

A variety of mechanisms have been characterized to explain the beneﬁts of transfor-
mational leadership (see: Bass, 1999; Porter and Bigley, 2001; Yukl, 1999, 2002).
Most of these propositions assume that transformational leaders promote intrinsic
motivation – or related states such as self concordance (Sheldon and Elliott, 1999)
or self determination (Deci and Ryan, 1985) – in followers. For example, according
to Bono and Judge (2003), transformational leaders demonstrate how the vision and
objectives they promulgate align with the values and desires that followers espouse.
These employees, therefore, feel the activities they undertake, and the targets they
pursue, are compatible with their intrinsic goals. As a consequence of their intrinsic
motivation to realize these goals, persistence soars and performance improves (for
characterizations of intrinsic motivation, see: Csikszentmihalyi, 1975, 1978; Izard,
1977; Pretty and Seligman, 1983).

Nevertheless, these mechanisms might not operate in all contexts or apply to all
individuals. For example, Moss et al. (2007) revealed that transformational leaders
fostered  commitment  and  loyalty  to  the  organization;  this  relationship,  however,
dissipated  as  openness  to  experience  in  followers,  as  measured  by  the  NEO-FFI
(Costa and McRae, 1992), decreased (for compatible ﬁndings, see Ehrhart and Klein,
2001).

Speciﬁcally,  the  beneﬁts  of  transformational  leadership  might  be  ampliﬁed  or
inhibited  by  the  goal  orientation  of  followers.  The  concept  of  goal  orientation
emanated from the work of Dweck and her colleagues with primary school children
(e.g. Diener and Dweck, 1978, 1980; Dweck, 1986; Dweck and Elliott, 1983; Dweck
and Leggett, 1988; Elliott and Dweck, 1988). According to Dweck and Elliott (1983),
children seem to adopt one of two distinct underlying goals: to either develop their
competence,  referred  to  as  a  learning  orientation,  or  demonstrate  their  ability,
referred to as a performance orientation. This distinction has also been uncovered in
adults (e.g. Farr et al., 1993) and has been clariﬁed and corroborated in a variety of
contexts,  sometimes  with  different  terminology  (see:  Ames,  1984;  Butler,  1992;
Harackiewicz and Elliott, 1993; Jagacinski, 1992; Nicholls, 1984). Nevertheless, the
principle  distinction  emphasizes  that  some  individuals  strive  to  enhance  their
competence and develop their expertise, whereas other individuals attempt to out-
perform their rivals or even colleagues.

Person-system  interaction  (PSI)  theory  (Kuhl,  2000),  when  combined  with  the
concept of optimal self esteem (Kernis, 2003), implies that goal orientation should
inﬂuence the impact of transformational leadership on follower attitudes, behaviour,
and performance. The next section introduces this theoretical framework.

Person system interaction theory and goal orientation

PSI  theory,  as  expounded  by  Kuhl  (2000),  characterizes  four  dynamic  cognitive
systems  –  extension  memory,  object  recognition,  intention  memory  and  intuitive
behavioural control – that underpin the regulation of cognition, emotion, motivation
and behaviour. Extension memory is conceptualized as a vast network that represents
the  unconscious  self,  including  personal  values,  possible  action  plans  and  auto-
biographical  memories  (Kuhl,  2000).  The  object  recognition  system  unearths
patterns, such as verbal directives, from the stimuli that impinge on each sensory
modality (Baumann and Kuhl, 2003, 2005). Intention memory formulates and stores
action  plans  that  thwart  and  supersede  automatic  action  sequences  (Goschke  and
Kuhl,  1993).  Finally,  intuitive  behavioural  control  executes  these  plans  and  also
initiates automatic actions.

According  to  Kuhl  (2000),  object  recognition  inhibits  extension  memory,  and
hence the cognitive processes that distil patterns from the environment impede access
to personal needs, preferences, and inclinations. In some employees, especially indi-
viduals who cannot moderate their negative affect, the object recognition system is
unduly active and extension memory is impeded. These individuals are less able to
utilize the vast network of past experiences and implicit knowledge that extension
memory confers. The behaviour of these individuals is primarily governed by the
cues they receive from the environment, such as demands from supervisors.

A performance orientation is likely to activate object recognition. In particular,
the prospect of extrinsic rewards and reinforcement is especially likely to motivate
individuals  who  exhibit  a  performance  orientation  (e.g.  Cury  et  al.,  2002; Young,
2005).  Hence,  the  behaviour  of  these  individuals  is  chieﬂy  governed  by  social
constructions rather than intrinsic desires – a manifestation of the object recognition
system (Baumann and Kuhl, 2003, 2005; Kuhl, 2000). Conversely, the potential to
experience feelings of enjoyment, fascination, and fulﬁllment are especially likely to
motivate individuals with a learning orientation (e.g. Cury et al., 2002; Young, 2005).
The  behaviour  of  these  individuals,  therefore,  is  primarily  dictated  by  intrinsic
preferences  rather  than  social  constructions,  which  reﬂects  unimpaired  access  to
extension memory (Baumann and Kuhl, 2003, 2005; Kuhl, 2000). Consistent with
this proposition, Van Yperen and Janssen (2002) showed that a learning orientation
mitigated the negative affect that employees experience when job demands escalate
(see  also:  Stevens  and  Gist,  1997; VandeWalle,  2001)  –  a  capacity  that  facilitates
access to extension memory (Baumann and Kuhl, 2005).

Individuals who exhibit a performance orientation, and thus do not often invoke
extension  memory,  will  demonstrate  a  speciﬁc  proﬁle  of  limitations.  First,  these
individuals cannot utilize the vast network of unconscious associations and alterna-
tive action plans that correspond to extension memory (Kuhl, 2000). Their ﬂexibility
and capacity to respond optimally to unexpected demands will decline. They will,
therefore,  overreact  to  minor  obstacles  in  their  environment  (see Van Yperen  and
Janssen, 2002). The extent to which they perceive their work context as supportive
will decrease, and their commitment to the organization should thus subside (Meyer
et al., 2002).

In addition to a decline in commitment, performance orientation can compromise
creativity  and  task  performance,  as  shown  by  Janssen  and  Van  Yperen  (2004).

Impeded access to this vast network of unconscious associations stymies creativity
(Kuhl, 2000). Obstructed access to extension memory can also impede the capacity
of  individuals  to  internalize  the  beliefs  and  attitudes  that  colleagues  express
(Baumann and Kuhl, 2003), which can hinder learning, development, and perform-
ance, a proposition that has been veriﬁed empirically (see: Brett and VandeWalle,
1999; Fisher and Ford, 1998; Sujan et al., 1994; VandeWalle et al., 1999).

Some,  but  not  all,  facets  of  transformational  leadership  can  facilitate  access  to
extension memory and thus offset these limitations in employees with a performance
orientation. For example, according to the concept of optimal self esteem, promul-
gated by Kernis (2003), the inclination to engage in biased cognitive processes can
impair access to unconscious self representations and thus inhibit extension memory.
When leaders exhibit intellectual stimulation, they encourage employees to challenge
their assumptions and question their beliefs (Bass, 1985). This tendency to question
assumptions and beliefs corresponds to a cognitive style called ﬂexible or decontex-
tualized thinking (Stanovich and West, 1997), which curbs these biases, facilitates
access  to  extension  memory  and  thus  redresses  the  limitations  associated  with  a
performance  orientation.  Employees  with  a  performance  orientation,  therefore,
should beneﬁt from intellectual stimulation.

Hypothesis 1
The  extent  to  which  intellectual  stimulation  is  positively  related  to  organizational
commitment,  creativity,  and  job  performance  should  increase  as  performance
orientation in followers rises.

Inspirational motivation should also foster access to extension memory. Speciﬁ-
cally, when leaders engage in inspirational motivation, they underscore the import-
ance and signiﬁcance of the goals and objectives they prescribe (Bass, 1985). They
demonstrate how these goals align with the intrinsic values of employees (Bono and
Judge, 2003). According to Kernis (2003), employees who are encouraged to pursue
goals that align with their values become more receptive to their unconscious desires,
enabling access to extension memory and thus ameliorating the shortcomings that
coincide with a performance orientation. Hence:

Hypothesis 2
The extent to which inspirational motivation is positively related to organizational
commitment,  creativity,  and  job  performance  should  increase  as  performance
orientation in followers rises.

Nevertheless, another facet of transformational leadership – idealized inﬂuence –
could compromise the job attitudes and behaviour of employees with a performance
orientation. Individuals who adopt a performance orientation feel their competence
and character is quintessentially immutable (El-Alayli, 2006), designated as an entity
theory (Dweck et al., 1995a,1995b; Plaks et al., 2001). Individuals with a perform-
ance orientation and entity theory are especially inclined to evaluate their relative
standing and thus become more inclined to engage in social comparisons (as shown
by Butler, 1992, 2000).

Social comparisons with exemplary role models can provoke both desirable and
adverse reactions. When individuals interact with a role model who excels in domains

437

that  are  not  germane  to  their  own  self  concept,  for  example,  their  evaluations  of
themselves improve (Tesser, 1988). Likewise, individuals who experience an inter-
dependent self construal (Kemmelmeier and Oyserman, 2001) or feel certain of their
own qualities and attributes (Pelham and Wachsmuth, 1995) also perceive themselves
more favourably after they form images of exemplary role models.

In contrast, consistent with the propositions that were formulated by Lockwood
and  Kunda  (1997),  social  comparisons  with  exemplary  role  models  are  likely  to
compromise self evaluations when individuals feel their character and competence
is immutable. In these instances, individuals feel they cannot develop the qualities
and attributes of the role model. The role model, therefore, underscores the features
and achievements the individuals cannot attain, undermining their self evaluations.
According to this argument, individuals who espouse an entity theory – an assump-
tion that often coincides with a performance orientation – are less likely to feel they
can  attain  the  attributes  of  leaders  who  engage  in  idealized  inﬂuence.  These
employees feel they have not fulﬁlled their aspirations or duties, and thus extension
memory is inhibited (Kuhl, 2000). Therefore:

Hypothesis 3
The  extent  to  which  idealized  inﬂuence  is  positively  related  to  organizational
commitment, creativity and job performance should decrease as performance orien-
tation in followers rises.

Finally,  contingent  reward,  in  which  leaders  offer  incentives  to  inﬂuence  the
behaviour of employees (Bass, 1985), is likely to activate object recognition and thus
impede access to extension memory (Kuhl, 2000). This leadership style, therefore,
is likely to amplify, rather than curb, the deﬁciencies associated with a performance
orientation.  Nevertheless,  this  leadership  style  might  improve  the  performance  of
employees who adopt a learning orientation. In particular, these individuals, because
of  their  access  to  extension  memory,  are  more  likely  to  internalize  the  goals  and
targets they are prescribed (Baumann and Kuhl, 2003, 2005). These targets, there-
fore,  are  not  perceived  as  a  social  construction  and  thus  do  not  impede  access  to
extension memory.

Hypothesis 4
The extent to which contingent reward is positively related to organizational commit-
ment,  creativity,  and  job  performance  should  increase  as  learning  orientation  in
followers rises.

Approach and avoidance in performance orientation

Recent  research  suggests  that  performance  orientation  might  entail  two  distinct
dimensions (e.g. VandeWalle, 1997). The ﬁrst dimension – referred to as ‘prove’ –
characterizes individuals whose principal motivation is to achieve favourable evalu-
ations and judgements. The second dimension – referred to as ‘avoid’ – character-
izes individuals whose principle motivation is to prevent unfavourable evaluations
and  judgements.  These  dimensions  are  reminiscent  of  the  distinction  between  a
promotion regulatory focus, in which individuals emphasize potential beneﬁts, gains

438


Leadership

The Impact of Goal Orientation Moss & Ritossa

and  hopes,  and  a  prevention  regulatory  focus,  in  which  individuals  focus  their
attention on failures, costs and unfulﬁlled duties (see Higgins, 1997, 1998, 2001).

When individuals adopt a prevention focus, their principal objective is to fulﬁll
their obligations and responsibilities. In particular, they feel the need to satisfy social
expectations and conventions (Higgins, 1997). Their attention tends to be directed
towards  potential  losses  or  shortfalls,  and  not  towards  possible  gains  and  beneﬁts
(Wang and Lee, 2006). Accordingly, when individuals adopt a prevention focus, they
perceive  change  as  a  potential  source  of  complications  and  threats  rather  than
opportunities and beneﬁts (Liberman et al., 1999), which provokes negative affects
(Higgins,  1987).  Consistent  with  this  argument,  relative  to  individuals  with  a
promotion focus, individuals with a prevention focus prefer stability rather than vari-
ation in their surroundings (Liberman et al., 1999). For these individuals, the stirring
but challenging visions that characterize inspirational motivation represent impend-
ing change, which underscores the potential for failure, promotes negative affect, and
activates object recognition (Kuhl, 2000). Hence, as a clariﬁcation of Hypothesis 2:

Hypothesis 5
A performance-avoid orientation, but not a performance-prove orientation, should
diminish the beneﬁts of inspirational motivation on employee commitment, creativ-
ity and job performance.

In short, this study will investigate whether or not goal orientation moderates the
extent to which leadership style affects employee performance, innovation, or work
attitudes. Employees will complete a series of scales that assess their goal orientation,
the leadership style of their supervisor, and their commitment to the organization. In
addition,  their  supervisor  will  assess  the  creativity  and  job  performance  of  these
employees.

Method

Participants

Thirty-eight government organizations – including local councils, as well as health
and welfare agencies – located throughout Australia participated in the study. Data
were returned from 263 leader–follower dyads, representing a response rate of 33 per
cent. That is, both supervisors and a subordinate of each supervisor participated, an
approach employed in many studies (e.g. Bass, 1985; Seltzer and Bass, 1987; Seltzer
et al., 1989; Singer, 1985; Tucker et al., 1992; Waldman et al., 1987; Yammarino and
Bass, 1990).

All followers worked a minimum of 30 hours per week, and six months duration,
under the same participating leader. The average age of followers was 40.05 years
(SD = 10.10, range = 19–66). In addition, the average age of participating leaders
was 43.79 years (SD = 9.04, range = 21–63). Furthermore, 58 per cent of the follow-
ers  were  female  and  36  per  cent  of  the  leaders  were  female.  On  average,  leaders
reported slightly over 10 years of managerial experience; followers reported 3.5 years
tenure with their current leader.

Materials

To minimize the potential effects of common method bias, data were collected from
both  followers  and  their  supervisors,  referred  to  as  leaders.  Followers  completed
scales that assessed the perceived leadership style of these supervisors, as well as
their  own  goal  orientation  and  organizational  commitment.  Leaders  completed  a
scale  that  assessed  the  performance  and  creativity  of  these  followers.  This  study
constitutes  one  component  of  a  larger  research  programme  in  which  other  scales,
such as leader emotional intelligence and follower motivation, were included as well.

Follower goal orientation
A  13-item  goal  orientation  instrument,  constructed  by  VandeWalle  (1997),  was
employed to assess the goal orientation of followers. The instrument comprises three
scales: learning orientation (e.g. ‘I am willing to select a challenging work assign-
ment that I can learn a lot from’); performance (prove) orientation (e.g. ‘I like to show
that I can perform better than my co-workers’); and performance (avoid) orientation
(e.g. ‘I would avoid taking on a new task if there was a clear chance that I would
appear  rather  incompetent  to  others’).  These  scales  comprise  ﬁve,  four,  and  four
items, respectively. All items were measured on a seven point scale from strongly
disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). VandeWalle (1997) reported internal consistency
alpha  values  of  .89,  .85,  and  .88  for  the  learning,  performance  (prove),  and
performance (avoid) scales, respectively.

Perceived leadership style
The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ Form 5x) (Bass and Avolio, 2000)
– the most widely used measure of transformational leadership – was employed to
gauge  leadership  style.  Participants  specify  the  frequency  with  which  their  leader
demonstrates  speciﬁc  behaviours  on  a  ﬁve-point  scale  from  not  at  all (0)  to
frequently, if not always (4).

The  MLQ  entails  ﬁve  subscales  of  transformational  leadership.  Sample  items
include: ‘Treats me as an individual rather than just as a member of a group’ (indi-
vidualized  consideration);  ‘Seeks  differing  perspectives  when  solving  problems’
(intellectual  stimulation);  ‘Articulates  a  compelling  vision  of  the  future’ (inspira-
tional motivation); ‘Acts in ways that builds my respect’ (idealized attributes); and
‘Speciﬁes the importance of having a strong sense of purpose’ (idealized behaviour).
Furthermore,  three  subscales  of  transactional  leadership  are  assessed,  such  as
‘Provides  me  with  assistance  in  exchange  for  my  efforts’ (contingent  reward);
‘Focuses attention on irregularities, mistakes, exceptions, and deviations from stan-
dards’ (active  management-by-exception);  and  ‘Fails  to  interfere  until  problems
become  serious’ (passive  management-by-exception).  Finally,  laissez-faire  leader-
ship is also examined (e.g. ‘Is absent when needed’). Each subscale comprised four
items. A meta-analysis of the MLQ literature reported alpha vales ranging between
.69 and .93 (Dumdum et al., 2002).

Follower organizational commitment
Organizational commitment was assessed using the instrument constructed by
Meyer  et  al.  (1993).  Six  items  assess  each  of  the  three  subscales:  affective,

440


Leadership

The Impact of Goal Orientation Moss & Ritossa

continuance, and normative dimensions. Affective commitment refers to the extent
to  which  individuals  feel  an  emotional  attachment  to  the  organization  and  have
embraced workplace goals and values. A sample item is ‘I would be very happy to
spend the rest of my career in this organization.’ Continuance commitment reﬂects
the extent to which individuals feel they would incur a concrete cost, such as a reduc-
tion in wages, if they departed from the organization. A typical statement includes
‘Right now, staying with my organization is a matter of necessity as much as desire.’
Finally, normative commitment represents a sense of duty or obligation to remain in
the organization. A sample item includes ‘I would not leave my organization right
now because I have a sense of obligation to the people in it.’

Responses were represented along a seven-point scale, from strongly disagree (1)
to strongly agree (7). Meyer et al. (1993) revealed encouraging internal consistency
coefﬁcients  of  .82,  .74,  and  .83  for  the  affective,  continuance  and  normative
commitment scales, respectively.

Follower performance
The  overall  work  performance  of  followers  was  assessed  through  leader  ratings,
using  an  eight-item  measure.  A  quantiﬁable  performance  measure  could  not  be
applied, because participants were recruited from many different roles and organiz-
ations. Applying the principles that were utilized by Campion et al. (1996), follow-
ers in the present sample were rated by their leaders on a variety of performance
factors  that  are  germane  to  all  employees:  quality  of  work,  customer  service
provided, responding promptly to problems, productivity and completing work on
time. An  example  item  included,  ‘Relative  to  other  individuals  in  the  workgroup,
please rate your subordinate on the extent to which he or she fulﬁls all the goals and
targets that they are assigned’. Responses were gauged along a ﬁve-point scale from
no extent (1) to a very large extent (5).

Follower creativity
To measure the creativity of followers, leaders completed the 13-item measure that
was  developed  by  George  and  Zhou  (2001).  This  scale  is  a  general  measure  of
creative  behaviour  in  the  workplace  and  assesses  the  extent  to  which  followers
suggest  and  implement  novel  and  effective  solutions,  processes,  and  procedures.
Throughout the organizational creativity literature, supervisor ratings of employee
creativity are ubiquitous. Many studies have reported convergence between super-
visor  ratings  and  objective  indices  of  creativity  (e.g.  Keller  and  Holland,  1982;
Oldham  and  Cummings,  1996;  Scott  and  Bruce,  1994; Tierney  et  al.,  1999),  thus
supporting the utility of this approach. A sample item included, ‘Relative to other
individuals in the workgroup, please rate your subordinate on the extent to which he
or she promotes and champions ideas to others’. Again, responses were gauged along
a  ﬁve-point  scale  from  no  extent (1)  to  a  very  large  extent (5).  George  and  Zhou
(2001) reported a Cronbach’s α of .96.

Procedure

Human Resources personnel distributed the Leader and Follower questionnaires to
selected leaders. No individuals participated as both a follower and again as a leader.

Results

Leaders were instructed to distribute the Follower questionnaire to the direct report
whose surname appeared ﬁrst alphabetically.

Each  of  the  questionnaires  could  be  completed  within  approximately  15–30
minutes at any time that was convenient to the participants. Coding was used to match
the Leader and Follower questionnaires and maintain anonymity. Participants were
asked to return the questionnaires anonymously and directly to the researcher using
pre-paid envelopes.

Data analytic strategy

To assess the hypotheses, three sets of ﬁve regression analyses were conducted. The
ﬁrst set of analyses determined whether learning orientation moderates the effect of
leadership style on follower outcomes. For each analysis, the criterion was one of the
ﬁve outcome measures – performance, creativity, affective commitment, continuance
commitment,  or  normative  commitment.  The  predictors  included  the  leadership
subscales, learning orientation, and the interaction between each leadership subscale
and learning orientation. To represent these interactions, the constituent scales were
centred and then multiplied together (Aiken and West, 1991). Signiﬁcant interaction
terms reﬂect moderation. The second and third set of analyses were identical, except
learning orientation was replaced with performance orientation (prove) and perform-
ance orientation (avoid) respectively. Because ﬁve outcome measures were included,
a Bonferroni adjustment was incorporated to control the family-wise Type I error rate
and α was set to .01.

Before  the  moderated  regression  analyses  were  conducted,  missing  values  were
identiﬁed  and  statistical  assumptions  were  assessed.  Missing  values  were  scarce
(1.35%) and randomly distributed across the variables. Three multivariate outliers
were uncovered and the data from these three dyads were excluded from analysis.
An analysis of the residual scatterplots revealed no consequential departures from
normality,  homoscedasticity,  or  linearity.  For  all  scales,  Cronbach’s  alpha  ranged
from .73 to .95, although one item needed to be deleted from the passive manage-
ment-by-exception subscale to reach these solid levels of internal consistency.

Table 1 presents the pairwise correlations between all study variables. No severe
instances  of  multicollinearity  were  uncovered  from  this  matrix  (Tabachnick  and
Fidell,  2001),  although  idealized  attributes  and  contingent  reward  were  highly
correlated, r(260) = .76

The effect of learning orientation on the relationship between
leadership and follower outcomes

Table 2 presents the standardized B and t values that emerged from the moderated
regression  analyses  that  examined  whether  learning  orientation  inﬂuences  the
relationship  between  leadership  style  and  normative  commitment.  In  addition,  as
shown in this table, the variance inﬂation factor was less than ﬁve for every predic-
tor, which corresponds to a tolerance of .2, suggesting that none of the factors were
redundant (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2001). This table reveals the association between

equations were derived from the standardized B values that emerged from the regres-

impact of contingent reward on normative commitment diminishes – and even seems
to reverse – when learning orientation declines, partly supporting Hypothesis 4.

reduced, intellectual stimulation seemed to be inversely related to normative commit-

The effect of performance orientation (avoid) on the relationship
between leadership and follower outcomes.

Table 4 reports the standardized B and t values that emerged from the moderated
regression analyses that investigated whether performance orientation (avoid) moder-
ated  the  association  between  leadership  style  and  affective  commitment.  The
variance inﬂation factor was less than 5 for every predictor. This output reveals the
association between inspirational motivation and affective commitment was moder-
ated  by  performance  orientation  (avoid).  Performance  orientation  (avoid)  did  not
moderate the relationship between leadership style and any of the other outcomes.
Figure 3 presents the relationship between inspirational motivation and normative
commitment  at  high  (z =  1)  and  low  (z =  –1)  levels  of  performance  orientation
(avoid). This ﬁgure demonstrates that the beneﬁcial impact of inspirational motiva-
tion on affective commitment diminishes as performance orientation (avoid) rises.
Indeed, when performance orientation (avoid) is sufﬁciently elevated, inspirational
motivation seems to obstruct affective commitment, consistent with Hypothesis 5.

Discussion

This study was designed to examine whether goal orientation inﬂuences the relation-
ship  between  leadership  style  and  follower  outcomes,  including  commitment,
performance  and  creativity.  The  study  uncovered  three  vital  ﬁndings:  ﬁrst,  the
positive  association  between  contingent  reward  and  normative  commitment  dissi-
pated  as  learning  orientation  subsided;  second,  the  positive  association  between

intellectual  stimulation  and  normative  commitment  also  diminished  as  the  prove
dimension of performance orientation decreased; and ﬁnally, the positive association
between  inspirational  motivation  and  affective  commitment  abated  as  the  avoid
dimension of performance orientation increased. Goal orientation, however, did not
moderate  the  extent  to  which  idealized  inﬂuence  or  individualized  consideration
inﬂuenced follower outcomes. Likewise, goal orientation did not inﬂuence the extent
to which leadership style inﬂuenced job performance or creativity.

The ﬁnding that learning orientation ampliﬁed the positive association between
contingent reward and normative commitment aligns with Hypothesis 4. A learning
orientation  promotes  intrinsic  motivation  (e.g. Young,  2005),  activates  extension
memory (Kuhl, 2000), and thus increases the likelihood that management directives
are internalized and embraced (Baumann and Kuhl, 2003, 2005). Hence, the formal
goals  and  targets  that  characterize  contingent  reward  should  not  unduly  activate
object recognition in employees who adopt a learning orientation. Access to exten-
sion memory, and hence the capacity of these individuals to withstand difﬁculties,
should remain intact (Kuhl, 2000). These individuals should experience a sense of
obligation  to  demonstrate  commitment  to  the  organization,  promoting  normative
commitment (Meyer et al., 2002).

Nevertheless,  an  alternative  account  could  also  explain  the  inverse  relationship
between contingent reward and normative commitment when learning orientation is
negligible. Speciﬁcally, contingent reward might be inversely related to normative
commitment when distributive injustice pervades the workplace (for deﬁnitions and
reviews of distributive injustice, see Skitka and Crosby, 2003; Van den Bos et al.,
1997). In particular, in these environments, the explicit expectations and incentives
that coincide with contingent reward might merely highlight these injustices. As a
consequence,  contingent  reward  might  underscore  violations  of  psychological
contracts and thus compromise normative commitment. Furthermore, when distrib-
utive justice is pervasive, employees might not feel they can improve their status,
which  promotes  an  entity  theory  and  ultimately  obstructs  a  learning  orientation
(Plaks et al., 2001).

In  short,  this  pattern  of  ﬁndings  could  potentially  be  ascribed  to  variations  in
distributive justice across organizations. That is, distributive injustice can both under-
mine  the  beneﬁts  of  contingent  reward  as  well  as  obstruct  a  learning  orientation.
Future  research  should  thus  measure  and  control  justice  before  the  associations
between goal orientation and leadership are explored (e.g. Colquitt, 2001).

The ﬁndings that a prove orientation ampliﬁes the positive association between
intellectual  stimulation  and  normative  commitment  supports  Hypothesis  1.  In
particular, intellectual stimulation fosters decontextualized thinking – the tendency
to  personally  challenge  beliefs  and  attitudes  (Stanovich  and West,  1997)  –  which
curbs the incidence of biased thinking, fosters access to unconscious self represen-
tations  (Kernis,  2003),  and  thus  activates  extension  memory.  Extension  memory
enhances the ﬂexibility that is needed to resolve workplace problems (Kuhl, 2000),
promoting the capacity to accommodate these difﬁculties, and ultimately elevating
the level of normative commitment (Meyer et al., 2002).

The  ﬁnding  that  an  avoidant  orientation  compromises  the  positive  association
between inspirational motivation and affective commitment aligns with Hypothesis 5.
When individuals adopt an avoidant orientation, they feel an intense need to fulﬁll

social  expectations  (Higgins,  1997)  as  well  as  prefer  stability  rather  than  change
(Liberman et al., 1999). Inspirational motivation might escalate these expectations,
promote change, activate object recognition (Kuhl, 2000), and thus exacerbate the
problems  associated  with  impaired  access  to  extension  memory.  These  problems
could also have obscured the anticipated moderating effect of performance (prove),
as speciﬁed in Hypothesis 1.

An alternative explanation could accommodate the inverse relationship between
inspirational motivation and affective commitment when avoidance is pronounced.
Speciﬁcally, charismatic, inspirational leaders are especially effective after a crisis,
such as a fatality or restructure (e.g. Cohen,  et al., 2004). As a consequence, organiz-
ations might promote inspirational motivation merely in response to some immediate
crisis.  Nevertheless,  after  this  crisis,  employees  might  become  more  cognizant  of
potential costs and drawbacks, which promotes an avoidance orientation. In addition,
after  a  crisis,  such  as  retrenchments,  inspirational  motivation  might  be  perceived
cynically.

In  short,  after  crises,  avoidance  might  prevail  but  the  impact  of  inspirational
motivation on commitment might diminish. Therefore, the pattern of ﬁndings can
perhaps be ascribed to contextual events, such as workplace crises. Future research
should thus restrict the sample to organizations in which dramatic changes have been
precluded.

Hypothesis 3 – that performance orientation should diminish the association
between idealized inﬂuence and follower behaviour – was not supported. The absence
of support could obviously be ascribed to limited statistical power. For instance,
idealized inﬂuence was highly correlated with contingent reward. The unique
variance in idealized inﬂuence was perhaps too limited to support the hypotheses.
Alternatively, the rationale that underpinned Hypothesis 3 could be challenged.
Performance  orientation  –  which  often  corresponds  to  the  assumption  that
competence  and  character  are  immutable  (El-Alayli,  2006)  –  was  assumed  to
promote social comparisons (Butler, 1992, 2000). Social comparisons with exem-
plary role models can underscore the qualities that individuals feel they cannot attain
(Lockwood and Kunda, 1997). Nevertheless, individuals who espouse a performance
orientation might be more cognizant of social rank. They would, therefore, recog-
nize that their leader is designated a higher echelon in the organization and would
not consider this person to be a valid standard. Role models who are not perceived
as a suitable standard of comparison are less likely to undermine the motivation of
individuals (see LeBouf and Estes, 2004). Furthermore, studies on social compari-
sons  with  role  models  have  usually  been  conducted  in  laboratory  settings  (for  a
review, see Collins, 1996). The familiarity that ensues after regular interactions with
role models might generate a different pattern of observations.

Some  other  hypothesized  ﬁndings  were  not  observed.  Goal  orientation  did  not
inﬂuence  the  association  between  leadership  and  either  performance  or  creativity.
Perhaps the object recognition system does not always impair job performance or
creativity.  To  demonstrate,  when  the  object  recognition  system  is  activated,  indi-
viduals become more inclined to follow social conventions (Kuhl, 2000). In some
environments, the tendency to comply with these conventions can actually promote,
rather  than  stiﬂe,  creativity.  Speciﬁcally,  this  tendency  promotes  creativity  in
employees whose peers are also creative and unconventional (see Jaussi and Dionne,

449

2003).  Future  research,  therefore,  should  examine  whether  characteristics  of  the
environment, such as the workplace culture, moderate the role of object recognition
and thus goal orientation.

Several limitations compromise the utility of this research. First, goal orientations
were assumed to be immutable. Contrary to this assumption, studies reveal that trans-
formational leadership can promote a learning orientation (Coad and Berry, 1998).
Thus, when transformational leadership is pronounced, employees who still demon-
strate a performance orientation have clearly resisted the principles that managers
have  attempted  to  impose.  This  resistance  could  reﬂect  other  factors,  such  as
impaired leader-member exchange (Basu and Green, 1997). More importantly, these
factors  themselves  –  and  not  goal  orientation  per  se  –  might  have  inﬂuenced  the
association  between  leadership  style  and  follower  outcomes. A  longitudinal  study
should thus be undertaken to establish whether goal orientation inﬂuences the impact
of future initiatives to promote transformational leadership.

Second, this study did not assess the mechanisms that mediate the effects of goal
orientation  on  the  relationship  between  leadership  and  outcomes.  For  example,
access to extension memory was claimed to underpin the ﬁnding that learning orien-
tation boosts the beneﬁcial effects of contingent reward. Future studies should thus
measure scales that reﬂect this access, such as private self consciousness (see Kernis,
2003), to verify this account.

In short, the ﬁndings suggest that a prove or learning orientation could amplify
the beneﬁts of suitable leadership behaviours, such as transformational leadership
or  contingent  reward.  Organizations  should  thus  attempt  to  nullify  an  avoidant
orientation before transformational leadership is actively encouraged. To illustrate,
rewards should partly depend on the level of improvement that employees demon-
strate to foster a learning orientation.
