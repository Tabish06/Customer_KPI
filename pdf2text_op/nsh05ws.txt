Abstract
The experience of job insecurity has been linked to several different outcomes, such as negative
attitudes towards work and the organization, turnover intention, as well as health complaints.
However, since the strength of these effects have been found to vary across studies, it is vital to identify
factors that could influence the relationships. The present study examines the moderating role of three
personality characteristics (negative affectivity, positive affectivity, and external locus of control) on
the relation between job insecurity and outcomes (mental health complaints, job dissatisfaction, and
job-induced tension). Data from 400 nurses at a Swedish acute care hospital (response rate 71%; 91%
women, aged 20/68 years) showed that both job insecurity and personality were related to strain.
Also, the data indicated some buffering effect of personality. Despite the gender bias of the sample, the
study provides additional support for the notion that job insecurity affects strain even after controlling
for individual characteristics. The study also expands the literature on job insecurity by pointing out
the influence of personality characteristics on the relationship between stressors and strain.

Introduction

Job insecurity, defined as a subjectively experienced worry about future involuntary job loss
(Greenhalgh & Rosenblatt, 1984; Hartley, Jacobsson, Klandermans, & Van Vuuren, 1991),
has gradually become an important focus for research on working life (see, for instance, the
special issues of European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology [Klandermans &
Van Vuuren, 1999] and Economic and Industrial Democracy [Sverke, 2003]). Since job
insecurity involves the experiencing of a threat, and implies a great deal of uncertainty
regarding whether individuals get to keep their jobs in the future, it has been described as a
stressor (Barling & Kelloway, 1996; De Witte, 1999).

Like other work-related stressors,

job insecurity is associated with a number of
detrimental consequences for both the individual and the organization. Several studies,
including a meta-analysis (Sverke, Hellgren, & Na¨swall, 2002), have related job insecurity
to strain such as mental health complaints (Ashford, Lee, & Bobko, 1989; Kinnunen,
Mauno, Na¨tti, & Happonen, 2000) and lower levels of job satisfaction (Davy, Kinicki, &
Scheck, 1997; Hellgren, Sverke, & Isaksson, 1999). Similarly, a positive relationship has
been identified between job insecurity and self-reported physical health complaints, as well

as objective health problems (Ferrie et al., 2001; Kinnunen & Na¨tti, 1994). Other
consequences of job insecurity have been documented as well; among these we find lower
levels of job involvement (Kuhnert & Palmer, 1991), decreased trust in the organization
(Ashford et al., 1989), decreased organizational commitment (McFarlane, Shore & Tetrick,
1991), and an increased intention to leave the organization (Hartley et al., 1991; Sverke
et al., 2002). There is also evidence that job insecurity negatively affects its postulated
outcomes over time, even after controlling for initial levels of well-being (Hellgren et al.,
1999; Roskies, Louis-Guerin, & Fournier, 1993). In addition, research suggests that mental
health complaints follow job insecurity perceptions rather than the other way around
(Hellgren & Sverke, 2003).

Given the negative consequences associated with job insecurity, the prevention of, or
buffering against, these consequences becomes necessary (Burchell, 1994; De Witte, 1999).
Previous research results point to systematic differences between groups (Kinnunen &
Na¨tti, 1994; Sverke et al., 2002). However, despite the fact that personality has been
identified as an important factor for appraisal of stress and for adopting strategies for
dealing with stress (Fleishman, 1984; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), as well as affecting self-
reports of well-being (Jex, Bliese, Buzzell, & Primeau, 2001), little attention has been paid
to the potential interaction between job insecurity and personality. The present study
investigates the moderating effect of three personality characteristics (negative affectivity,
positive affectivity, and external locus of control) on the relation between job insecurity and
strain (mental health complaints, job dissatisfaction, and job-induced tension).

There are two main reasons why we expect these personality characteristics to affect the
relation between job insecurity and strain. The first one deals with how personality
dispositions influence individuals’ evaluation of the situation and their well-being. Those
personality characteristics that are related to a negative perception of the self and others
tend to have an influence on individuals, so that they often experience more negative
symptoms than those with more positive dispositions (Hart & Cooper, 2001). The second
explanation involves the influence of personality on the way individuals handle situations.
That is, personality characteristics affect the way individuals appraise and deal with a
threatening situation. Generally speaking, certain dispositions may lead individuals to
handle threats more constructively and thus experience reactions that are less negative (Cox
& Ferguson, 1991; Parkes, 1994). For example, an internal locus of control has been
associated with the employment of more direct strategies for dealing with stress (Parkes,
1994), and such strategies have been associated with less negative outcomes (Callan, 1993).
Many different dimensions of personality have been described in previous research,
making it difficult to take all of these into account. In the present study we focus on three
aspects of personality that have received attention in previous research on job insecurity,
namely negative and positive affectivity (Hellgren et al., 1999; Roskies et al., 1993) and
locus of control (Hartley et al., 1991).

Negative and positive affectivity, which represent two related but distinct dimensions of
disposition (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), have been described as approximately
representing the personality dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion, respectively
(Gustavsson, Jo¨ nsson, Linder, & Weinryb, 2003). Negative affectivity refers to the degree to
which an individual interprets the world in negative terms as well as the tendency to
experience negative mood states (Watson et al., 1988). Positive affectivity, on the other
hand, encompasses one’s positive outlook, sociability, and tendency to be in a positive
mood (Judge, Thoresen, Pucik, & Welbourne, 1999). Research has shown that individuals
with high levels of negative affectivity tend to consistently report more stress reactions than


Personality characteristics, job insecurity and strain 39

those with low negative affectivity, and that positive affectivity is associated with reports of
higher levels of well-being (Hellgren et al., 1999; Roskies et al., 1993). Studies testing the
interactive effect of affectivity and job insecurity on strain have found that negative
affectivity may moderate the effects of job insecurity on physical strain (Mak & Mueller,
2000) as well as mental health complaints (Roskies et al., 1993). In both cases, the
combination of high negative affectivity and high levels of job insecurity was related to
reports of higher levels of strain, whereas those low in negative affectivity reported less strain
when job insecurity was high. However, it is not clear whether positive affectivity acts as a
moderator between job insecurity and strain.

Locus of control describes an individual’s general beliefs regarding the relationship
between his or her own behaviour and outcomes (Antonovsky, 1991). Control may be
perceived to be outside of the individual (external locus of control), thus reflecting the
individual’s perception that he or she does not control events to any greater extent. The
locus of control can also be internal, such that the individual feels that he or she generally
has influence over everyday events (Rotter, 1966; Spector, 1982). It has been suggested that
an internal locus of control relates to lower levels of perceived stress, in that it increases the
belief
in one’s own control, thus potentially facilitating the use of problem-focused
strategies (Parkes, 1994). One study found that locus of control moderated the relation
between demands and strain, such that those with external locus of control reacted more
negatively to work demands (Newton & Keenan, 1990). An external locus of control has,
along with neuroticism, been considered to be an aspect of psychological vulnerability
(Parkes & Razavi, 2004), and it has been found that individuals with an external locus of
control report higher levels of job insecurity than individuals with an internal locus of
control (Hartley et al., 1991). However, few studies have related locus of control to
consequences of job insecurity, and the moderating effect of locus of control on the relation
between job insecurity and strain has yet to receive more systematic empirical attention.

Present study

By investigating the potential moderating effect of positive and negative affectivity, in
addition to external locus of control, on the relation between job insecurity and strain
(mental health complaints,
job dissatisfaction, and job-induced tension), we extend
previous research on job insecurity and its consequences, and contribute information
regarding the impact of personality in relation to reactions to an important stressor in
working life. The present study tests the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1. Job insecurity is related to mental health complaints, job dissatisfaction, and
job-induced tension when demographic variables, negative affectivity, positive affectivity,
and locus of control have been taken into account.

Hypothesis 2. Personality variables are related to mental health complaints, job dissatisfac-
tion, and job-induced tension when demographic variables and job insecurity have been
taken into account.

Hypothesis 3. Low levels of negative affectivity, high levels of positive affectivity, and low
levels of external locus of control are associated with less negative reactions to job insecurity
in terms of mental health complaints, job dissatisfaction, and job-induced tension than high
levels of negative affectivity, low levels of positive affectivity, and high levels of external locus
of control.

Method

Participants and setting

Data were collected in 1998 among nurses at an acute care hospital in the Stockholm region
of Sweden. Prior to data collection, the hospital had undergone organizational changes in
an effort to achieve cost containment and increased productivity. Examples of such changes
were the introduction of new management practices, the closing or merging of wards,
increased use of temporary employees, and small-scale layoffs. Still, the demand for
healthcare employees on the labour market was high during this period.

Questionnaires were sent to the home addresses of all 715 nurses at the hospital and were
accompanied by a letter in which hospital management encouraged participation. In
accordance with ethical guidelines for questionnaire studies, a covering letter from the
research team*/outlining the general objective of the study, declaring that participation in
the study was voluntary, and assuring the confidentiality of the responses*/was included in
the questionnaire packet. Three reminders were sent out in order to increase participation
in the study, and a total of 512 questionnaires were returned in the pre-stamped envelopes
that were provided*/resulting in a response rate of 71%. Listwise deletion for internal
attrition yielded an effective sample of 400 nurses. Most of the nurses were women (91%),
and the mean age was 43 years (SD
/10, range 20/68 years), which may be compared to a
mean age of 43 years and 85% women in the total occupational group at the hospital. Of the
participants 78% were living with a partner, and 39% had children living at home. The
proportion of employees working on temporary contracts was 15%, and 46% worked part-
time. The average tenure in the organization was 14 years (SD
/9, range 1/38 years).

Measures

Table I shows intercorrelations, means, standard deviations, and reliabilities (Cronbach’s a )
for the variables included in the study. All scale reliabilities were satisfactory.

Demographics. Gender (0
/woman, 1
/man), age, living with a partner (0
/no partner,
1
/partner), children living at home (0
/no children, 1
/children at home), temporary
contract type (0
/permanent, 1
/temporary), part-time work (0
/full-time, 1
/part-
time), and tenure were included as control variables.

Job insecurity. Employees’ level of job insecurity was measured with 9 items, based on
Ashford et al. (1989), reflecting uncertainty and threat to the future of the present
employment. The response alternatives ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree) for statements such as ‘I may be permanently laid off from my job’.

Moderators: personality variables. All personality variables were scored on a 5-point Likert
scale (1
/strongly disagree; 5
/strongly agree). Negative and positive affectivity were both
measured according to the scales developed by Agho, Price, and Mueller (1992). The
negative affectivity scale consisted of items such as ‘I often find myself worrying about
something’, while the positive affectivity scale was comprised of items such as ‘I always
seem to have something pleasant to look forward to’. External
locus of control was
measured with those eight items from Spector’s (1988) Work Locus of Control scale that
were designed to reflect external locus of control. A sample item is ‘Getting the job you
want is mostly a matter of luck’.

Outcomes: psychological strain. Mental health complaints were measured by the 12-item
General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; Goldberg, 1972). Each item represents the presence
of a negative symptom experienced during the preceding weeks (e.g. ‘Difficulty sleeping
due to worry’) with the accompanying response alternatives ranging between 0 (never) and
3 (always). Job dissatisfaction was assessed by a 3-item scale (e.g. ‘I enjoy being at my job’)
developed by Hellgren, Sjo¨ berg, and Sverke (1997), based on Brayfield and Rothe’s (1951)
job satisfaction scale. This scale, which was designed to measure employees’ overall level of
satisfaction with their job (1
/strongly disagree, 5
/strongly agree), was reversed in the
context of the present study so that a high score now represents a high level of job
dissatisfaction. Job-induced tension was measured by a scale developed by House and Rizzo
(1972). The items focus on strain that can be ascribed to the job (e.g. ‘I have felt fidgety or
nervous as a result of my job’) and the response alternatives ranged from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

Methods of analysis

The main and interactive effects of job insecurity and personality on strain were tested using
hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Demographic characteristics were controlled for
and entered in the first step along with job insecurity. The three personality variables
(negative affectivity, positive affectivity, and external locus of control) were entered in the
second step, in order to investigate their relative importance. The interaction terms of job
insecurity with each of the three personality variables were then entered in the third step to
test for the hypothesized moderating effect of personality on the relation between job
insecurity and strain. Following the procedures described by Aiken and West (1991), the
predictor variables were centred, i.e. the means of these variables were set to zero while the
standard deviations were kept
regression analyses were
performed, one for each outcome variable. The results are presented in Table II.

Results

In the case of mental health complaints, none of the demographic control variables entered
along with job insecurity in Step 1 (age, gender, children living at home, living with
a partner, temporary work, part-time work, tenure) emerged as significant predictors.
Job insecurity was positively related to mental health complaints (R2
/.02, p B/.01). When
the three personality variables were entered in Step 2, there was a sharp increase in the
amount of variance explained (DR2
/.44, p B/.001). Both negative affectivity and external
locus of control were positively related to mental health complaints, and positive affectivity
exhibited a negative relation with the criterion. However, the effect of job insecurity
was no longer significant. When the three interaction terms were entered in the last step
(DR2
/.01, p B/.05), one of these was significant. The significant interaction between job
insecurity and locus of control indicates that those with a greater degree of external locus of
control reported higher levels of mental health complaints when experiencing higher job
insecurity (M
/2.04), than those with less external locus of control (M
/1.84). When job
insecurity levels were low there was no significant difference between individuals low
in external locus of control (M
/1.60) and individuals high in external locus of control
(M
/ 1.76). In total, the model variables accounted for 47% of the variance in mental
health complaints.

The results for job dissatisfaction exhibited a somewhat similar pattern. Job insecurity
was positively related with the outcome in Step 1, whereas temporary work was negatively

/.06, p B/.01). In Step 2, when the personality variables
were entered, the proportion of explained variance increased (DR2
/.10, p B/.001), and the
effects of temporary work and job insecurity remained significant. Positive affectivity was
negatively related to job dissatisfaction and external locus of control was positively related
to the outcome, whereas negative affectivity did not emerge as a significant predictor. All
significant coefficients remained in Step 3, without any large changes in magnitude, as the
interaction terms were entered. None of these had any impact on strain, and there was no
change in the variance explained. The model accounted for 16% of the variation in job
dissatisfaction.

In sum, 28% of the variation in job-induced tension was accounted for by the model
variables.

Discussion

The present study was founded on the idea that personality characteristics moderate the
relation between job insecurity and strain. The positive relation between job insecurity and
strain has been well documented (Sverke et al., 2002). However, it may be assumed that
individual differences exist in the strength of the relation between stressor (job insecurity)
and strain since such differences influence situational appraisal and coping strategies (Hart
& Cooper, 2001; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).

Main effect of job insecurity

In support of Hypothesis 1, the results identified a positive relation between job insecurity
and strain. Those experiencing job insecurity reported more dissatisfaction with their job
and more job-induced tension*/even when personality and demographic variables were
controlled for. This result is in line with earlier research (Ashford et al., 1989; Kinnunen
et al., 2000), but extends this research by including three personality characteristics in the
analysis (negative affectivity, positive affectivity, and external locus of control). The results
show that, even after controlling for the three personality characteristics, job insecurity had
an impact on two of the strain variables. Thus, the study strengthens the evidence that job
insecurity is an important stressor.

However, after controlling for personality disposition, the impact of job insecurity on
mental health complaints was non-significant. The present results indicate that previous
research may have overestimated the relation between job insecurity and mental health
complaints by not controlling for personality characteristics. This is contrary to previous
studies that have identified significant relations between job insecurity and mental health
complaints after controlling for disposition (Hellgren et al., 1999; Mak & Mueller, 2000).
More research controlling for personality characteristics in the relation between job
insecurity and strain is needed, however, especially given the recurring strong relation
between job insecurity and mental health complaints found in previous research (Sverke
et al., 2002; see also Spector, 1994, for a discussion).

Main effect of personality characteristics

In support of Hypothesis 2, the present study also identified main effects of personality
characteristics on strain. Replicating earlier research (Brief, Burke, George, Robinson, &
Webster, 1988; Mak & Mueller, 2000; Roskies et al., 1993), negative affectivity was a strong
predictor of both mental health complaints and job-induced tension. This indicates that
those who are prone to negative and pessimistic thinking may be more likely to experience
strain than those low in negative affectivity. Positive affectivity evidenced a moderately
strong effect on mental health complaints and job dissatisfaction. In line with previous
research (Hellgren et al., 1999; Mak & Mueller, 2000; Roskies et al., 1993), those with a
more positive outlook reported less strain compared to those with lower levels of positive
affectivity. Furthermore,

& Keenan, 1990), that those more prone to external attributions tend to report higher levels

of both mental health complaints, job dissatisfaction, and job-induced tension compared to
those with less external locus of control.

These findings indicate that personality characteristics are more important than job
job
insecurity in explaining variation in mental health complaints. In the case of
dissatisfaction and job-induced tension, job insecurity remained an important, but not
the most influential, predictor. The results also suggest, in line with reasoning emphasizing
the importance of including affective dispositions in stress research (Spector, Zapf, Chen, &
Frese, 2000), that the main effect of personality characteristics on strain must be taken into
account in stress research.

Interaction effect of job insecurity and personality characteristics

Hypothesis 3 suggested that personality characteristics were expected to moderate the
relation between job insecurity and strain. There was a significant interaction effect of job
insecurity and external locus of control on mental health complaints. This supports our
hypothesis, which suggested that those with external locus of control would react more
negatively to job insecurity, and is in agreement with previous research findings on locus of
control and strain (Newton & Keenan, 1990). This result extends research on job insecurity
by indicating that locus of control may be important for employees’ reactions to job
insecurity. The moderating effect of locus of control on the relation between job insecurity
and mental health complaints also suggests that individuals high in external attributions
need to receive more support from the organization during periods associated with higher
uncertainty, in order to alleviate strain in this group.

However, care must be taken when interpreting the results, as eight of the nine
moderating effects tested were non-significant. An explanation for this lack of moderating
effect in the case of two of the strain variables (job dissatisfaction and job-induced tension)
may be that the issue is more complex than the tests in the present study allowed for.
Those personality characteristics which predispose individuals to evaluate themselves,
their own abilities, and the rest of the world in generally positive terms are expected to
increase the likelihood of the utilization of problem-focused coping strategies (Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984; Roskies et al., 1993). Such strategies, where individuals deal with the
situation by addressing the problem, have been related to less negative stress reactions
(Callan, 1993). One of the few studies relating job insecurity to coping strategies found that
problem-focused coping strategies buffered the effect of job insecurity on mental health
complaints (Roskies et al., 1993). However, the relation between personality characteristics
and coping in the context of job insecurity has yet to receive extensive research attention.
Accordingly, an area for future research is how personality characteristics affect coping
strategies, and how coping strategies moderate the relation between job insecurity and
strain.

Limitations and future research

It is important to keep in mind that the sample used in this study consisted of a rather
homogenous group of mostly female (91% of the respondents were women) registered and
assistant nurses from one organization. Even if using a homogenous group decreases the
influence of uncontrolled factors, this may impair the generalizability of the results to other
populations. The gender bias of our sample may have contributed to an underestimation of
the effect of job insecurity on strain, as it has been found that reactions to job insecurity are
stronger among men (De Witte, 1999). However, women tend to report higher levels of job

insecurity (Na¨swall & De Witte, 2003), as well as lower levels of subjective well-being
(Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999), than men. Such inconsistencies in research results
make it difficult to conclude to what extent our results may be generalized to groups with a
larger proportion of men. The present study should thus be replicated in samples drawn
from different occupations and types of work with a more even gender distribution, as well
as during times of differing degrees of turbulence.

Another possible concern is the fact that the present study relied solely on self-report
measures of job insecurity, personality, and strain. It has been argued that failing to take
into account the objective situation leaves out important sources of explanations of strain
(Schaubroeck, 1999). We argue, in agreement with Perrewe´ and Zellars (1999) and
transactional models of stress (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), that the subjective interpretation
of a situation gives rise to the individual’s reactions. However, whereas we maintain that
self-reported data is not only an appropriate source of information but an essential one in
the context of job insecurity, we acknowledge that research would benefit from including
both subjective and objective indicators of health.

The study’s design precludes us from investigating the impact of job insecurity over time
as well as the moderating effect of personality characteristics on subsequent strain. The use
of longitudinal studies is often encouraged in stress research in order to investigate
development over time and to give more substantial support for causal inferences. However,
cross-sectional studies provide some insight into the relations between variables and also
illustrate what issues should be the focus of future longitudinal studies (Spector, 1994). The
results of the present study point out that personality characteristics are relevant in job
insecurity research, but also that it is necessary to widen the scope of the investigation of
personality in the context of job insecurity.

The present study found that only one personality characteristic moderated the relation
between job insecurity and one of the three outcomes. One explanation for this is that
personality has only a marginal impact on the relation between job insecurity and the other
two strain variables. Since the present study tested the moderating effect of only three
aspects of personality, it is plausible that other personality characteristics are more likely to
act as moderators of the relation between stressors and strain. It would, for instance be
relevant to investigate other characteristics such as self-esteem (Locke, McLear, & Knight,
1996), sense of coherence (Antonovsky, 1991), the five-factor model (Costa & McCrae,
1992), or a generally positive self-concept (Judge, Locke, Durham, & Kluger, 1998) as
moderating variables since they capture broader dispositional characteristics. Thus, the
inclusion of additional personality characteristics as potential moderators of the relation
between job insecurity and strain may be a fruitful focus for future research.

intake, or dietary habits may be useful

The present study tested the association between one stressor, job insecurity, and three
outcomes. However, there may have been other factors that, when taken into account,
could have explained more variance in the outcome variables than did job insecurity. For
instance, factors related to non-work behaviours such as exercise behaviour, smoking,
alcohol
for explaining health outcomes.
Unfortunately, our data did not allow for such analyses. It is also difficult to take all
third-variables into account since there are always numerous factors influencing a certain
outcome (Judd, Jessor, & Donovan, 1986). A few previous studies control for other
stressors, but the results are not conclusive. For example, Hellgren and Sverke (2001)
found that job insecurity was related to well-being and job satisfaction even after other work
stressors were controlled for, whereas Ma¨kikangas and Kinnunen (2003) found that job
insecurity was only related to some strain outcomes among women when other stressors


were taken into account. Job insecurity thus appears to be an important stressor, but more
research is needed to investigate its relative impact on strain.

Personality characteristics, job insecurity and strain 47

Concluding remarks

The present study adds to previous research by emphasizing that job insecurity is an
important job stressor, even after controlling for personality disposition. In comparison to
previous studies, we controlled for three personality variables simultaneously when
investigating the relation between job insecurity and strain. The fact that job insecurity
remained a predictor in two out of three cases emphasizes the significance of this job
stressor. Our results also show that it is important to include personality in job insecurity
research,
lest we overestimate the relation between job insecurity and its potential
outcomes.

In line with our expectations, we found that locus of control moderated the relation
between job insecurity and mental health complaints, indicating that personality char-
acteristics are of importance for how individuals react to stressors. This may be an
indication that personality characteristics should be considered as moderators, and that we
need theory development as well as more empirical studies investigating this issue.
However, we found no other moderating effects of personality, which may suggest that
job insecurity affects individuals similarly, regardless of their dispositions. Dispositions may
not prevent people from experiencing strain related to job insecurity. The present study
underscores the need for additional information on how dispositions and coping with stress
are interrelated, and how these factors may affect the consequences of job insecurity. An
investigation of the mechanisms involved in the relation between stressor and strain, such as
appraisal and coping, would provide valuable insight into how different individuals may be
assisted in handling stressful situations that are related to uncertainty in the workplace*/
where the prevention of strain is becoming increasingly important.
