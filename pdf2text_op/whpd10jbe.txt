Social Responsibility and the Olympic
Games: The Mediating Role of Consumer
Attributions

ABSTRACT. Current literature suggests that corporate
social responsibility (CSR) can affect consumers’ attitudes
towards an organization and is regarded as a driver for
reputation-building and fostering sustained consumer
patronage. Although prior research has addressed the
direct influence of CSR on consumer responses, this
research examined the mediating influence of consumer’s
perceived organizational motives within an NGO setting.
Given the heightened public attention surrounding
the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, data were collected
from consumers of the Games to assess their perceptions
of the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) socially
responsible initiatives. We hypothesized that consumers
of the Games were likely to cognitively elaborate on CSR
messages by way of
three specific attribution effects
derived from the literature. The results show that, con-
tingent on CSR awareness, consumers responded posi-
tively to social efforts judged to be values-driven and
stakeholder-driven; and a negative response was seen for
efforts judged to be strategic. These attribution effects
influenced various
types of patronage and perceived
organizational reputation.

bility, Olympic Games, mediation

Introduction

Stemming from business practices in the second half
of the twentieth century, societal and business con-
sciousness of corporate social responsibility (CSR)
has risen dramatically. Discussions in the popular
press (Alsop, 2004), among business and political
leaders (O’Rourke, 2003), and in the academic lit-
erature (Crampton and Patten, 2008; Edward and
Willmott, 2008; Matten and Crane, 2005), have
spurred an interesting debate over the nature and

scope of CSR in modern business. This debate has
led to the emergence of various
theories and
approaches used to describe the business–society rela-
tionship (Wood, 2000). Accordingly, CSR is viewed
as a subset of corporate obligations dealing with a
company’s voluntary and discretionary relationships
with its societal stakeholders (Waddock, 2004) to
‘‘… minimize or eliminate harmful effects and
maximize long-run beneﬁcial impacts on society’’
(Mohr et al., 2001, p. 47). Not surprisingly, this
debate has also reﬂected the instrumental
(i.e.,
business pragmatism) discussions on the relationship
between a ﬁrm’s reputation, stakeholder associations,
and corporate success
(Sen et al., 2006). The
instrumentalist position is perpetuated, however, by
the recent spate of social
irresponsibility providing
ammunition to the media depicting organizations
that promote social responsibility as deceptive and
self-interested (Basu and Palazzo, 2008).

the past 20 years

Irrespective of an instrumental business orienta-
tion,
the rising inﬂuence of nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs; especially nonproﬁt NGOs)
signiﬁcant business
has been one of
developments over
(Doh and
Guay, 2006). While strategy has generally been
regarded as the impetus for CSR policy implemen-
tation, NGO views (and societal views of social
issues) have inﬂuenced the social policy-making
processes of many large business groups. According
to Winston (2002), NGOs have risen dramatically in
number, power, and inﬂuence; and their force has
been felt in a range of major public policy debates,
resulting in major changes in corporate governance.
As a result, many now regard NGOs as a counter-
weight
to business and global capitalism (Doh
and Teegan, 2002), although others suggest that

‘‘privatizing’’ public policies that deal with social
(Lyon and
issues are inherently risky ventures
Maxwell, 2008). Nonetheless,
the emergence of
NGOs seeking to promote what they perceive to be
more socially responsible business practices has
generated substantial changes in corporate strategy
(Doh and Teegen, 2003).

No such recent example of NGO inﬂuence is
better than the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) and the Olympic organizing committees in
answering the critics’ calls by addressing the social
impacts derived from mega-sporting events. Sport,
in general, and the Olympic Movement, in partic-
ular, have frequently been promoted as a force for
good in the world (Black and Bezanson, 2004;
Bloom et al., 2005; International Olympic Com-
mittee, 2008). However, critics of the Games argue
that rather than promoting ‘‘Olympism’’ the Games
have been used to leverage public funds to satisfy
elite economic interests resulting in long-term debt
and negative host city impacts (Andranovich et al.,
2002; Hall, 2006; Lenskyj, 2003; Whitson and
Macintosh, 1993). As well, concerns relating to the
environmental
the Games have been
forwarded (Berkaak, 1999; Getz, 2005; Leopkey and
Parent, 2009; Stubbs, 2001). These practices have
led to arguments that CSR among sport organiza-
tions breeds public cynicism as consumers now
suspect many organizations of
‘‘greenwashing’’
(Breitbarth and Harriss, 2008) and cause exploitation
(Vlachos et al., 2009).

impacts of

For the Olympic Games, social progress is cen-
tered on the symbolic importance that many nations
have placed on winning the right to host, and then
successfully hosting the Games (Black and Bezanson,
2004; Whitson and Macintosh, 1993). Much ‘‘face’’
was on the line in the run-up to the Beijing
Olympics as their billing as the ‘‘Green Games’’ was
dichotomized by China’s poor
environmental
record. Consequently, this was a major source of
leverage for activists (and the media) interested in
discrediting the Chinese government and the IOC
for their selection of the host site. Therefore, the
associations that Olympic consumers assigned to the
Games represented a new battleground over what
Sen et al. (2006, p. 158) termed ‘‘stakeholder mind
share.’’ As witnessed by the media attention given to
the Games, the Beijing Organizing Committee for
the Olympic Games
attempted to

leverage the associations
formed to
garner positive publicity for China (Se´guin et al.,
2008). While intuitively appealing, the actual inﬂu-
ence and direction of
such associations held by
Olympic consumers is empirically unknown.

Much of the consumer association research has
centered on corporate ability (CA – ability to pro-
duce a quality product)
and corporate social
responsibility (CSR – commitment to social causes;
Brown and Dacin, 1997; Sen et al., 2006). Not until
recently have researchers begun to address the psy-
chological mechanisms through which these types of
associations inﬂuence the attitudinal and behavioral
reactions of consumers (Berens et al., 2005; Ellen
et al., 2006; Gurhan-Canli and Batra, 2004; Mad-
rigal, 2000; Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001). Research
on CSR-driven consumption has focused on the
cognitive components of CSR strategy (i.e., aware-
ness of CSR; Du et al., 2007) as antecedents to
certain behavioral components (Bhattacharya and
Sen, 2003; Klein and Dawar, 2004; Mohr et al.,
2001; Sen et al., 2006), without taking into account
any interaction effects that may inﬂuence this rela-
tionship. Sen et al. (2006) put forth two noteworthy
points about current CSR research: (1) most work in
this area has presumed (in laboratory studies) CSR
awareness on the part of the test populations and (2)
the real-world impact of CSR awareness is more
multifaceted than is currently acknowledged. Fur-
ther, Du et al. (2007, p. 224) suggested ‘‘… the need
for CSR research to move beyond controlled con-
texts to paint a more externally valid picture of the
forces determining consumer reactions to CSR.’’

Based on the preceding commentary and by uti-
lizing a framework describing consumers’ attribu-
tional judgments of CSR as values-, stakeholder-,
and strategic-driven (see Ellen et al., 2006), this
research sought to extend the scope of consumer
attribution research by integrating and reﬁning
current models to (1) understand how ‘‘real-world’’
consumers view organizational motives for social
engagement of NGOs and (2) contingent on CSR
awareness, understand the mediating inﬂuence
attribution effects have on relevant organization-
level outcomes. While consumer perceptions (in gen-
eral)
(Bhattacharya and Sen,
2003; Hoefﬂer and Keller, 2002; Pelsmacker et al.,
2005), awareness alone is generally considered to be
a weak predictor of actual behavior, especially in the

social marketing arena (Shaw and Clarke, 1999).
Thus, assessing the indirect inﬂuence of consumer
attributions may provide additional insight into this
seemingly complex relationship. The central thesis
of this study is that consumer attributions directed
toward the IOC would help to better predict certain
CSR-driven attitudinal and consumption patterns –
speciﬁcally, consumer patronage and perceived orga-
nizational reputation.

This article is organized into several sections.
First, the context of the study is discussed (i.e.,
nature and scope of the focal international nonproﬁt
organization). Second, the hypothesized measure-
ment model is presented which illustrates the role of
attribution-based consumption relative to the out-
comes. The methodology is then described and the
results of the analyses are presented and discussed.
Finally, conclusions based on our empirical ﬁndings
are offered.

Research context: the IOC and the Olympic
Games

scale of

Hosting the Games can result in a variety of impacts
on the host region, particularly within the human,
ﬁnancial,
industrial, and environmental areas. For
example, the (Summer) Games bring together in
excess of 10,500 athletes (in 300 events), 200 inter-
national delegations, 20,000 international media, and
4 billion spectators and television viewers (Interna-
tional Olympic Committee, 2009a). Given the tre-
mendous
these different elements, an
organizing committee (e.g., BOGOC) has 7 years to
prepare. These preparations require (at the outset)
only a few individuals but can quickly escalate to
tens of thousands of volunteers and other paid staff
who need to mobilize a variety of stakeholder groups
(e.g., governments, media, community, sponsors,
sport organizations, international delegations, etc.).
The IOC is a nonproﬁt/NGO considered to be at
the same level as other global NGOs (e.g., UNE-
SCO, UN, Red Cross; see Chappelet and Ku¨bler-
Mabbott, 2008). The IOC’s activities are supported
by both UN and UNESCO resolutions. For
example, as part of its historical foundation and core
aspects, the IOC’s Olympic Truce is enacted during
each summer and winter edition of the Games and is
actually adopted as a resolution in the fall preceding

the Games by the UN General Assembly. What’s
more, the IOC’s owners, its 115 members forming
the General Assembly or Session, are volunteers and
do not receive the proﬁts incurred by the organi-
zation. The IOC members are individuals and not
organizations or states; and they (in fact) pride
themselves on not being led by external stakeholders
(e.g., governments, sponsors, etc.) for managerial
decisions. The organization is adamant about having
representative organizations in each country (e.g.,
the Canadian Olympic Committee,
the United
States Olympic Committee) to represent its interest,
not
the other way around (i.e., Canada or the
United States having its interest represented at the
IOC). The IOC is
therefore a member-driven
entity. As a simple example, the IOC’s past president,
Juan Antonio Samaranch, was famous for making
the IOC session and Executive Board follow his
desires (see Jennings, 2000; Pound, 2004). Thus, by
their very nature, such organizations (i.e., NGOs, or
nonproﬁts more broadly) are believed to have a
CSR-related purpose (i.e., to help the greater good
in lieu and in addition to proﬁt maximization). As
such, we can reasonably surmise that positive CSR
perceptions of these organizations held by their cli-
ents are a critical aspect of the continued survival and
success of these organizations. Moreover, given the
above, we also see that this study’s ﬁndings can be
applied to not only other major international sport
federations, such as FIFA (soccer) and IAAF (track
and ﬁeld), but also to other global NGOs.

From a ﬁduciary standpoint, the Games require
signiﬁcant spending from the organizing committee,
as well as from governments and ofﬁcial sponsors.
The top sponsors of the 2012 London Games are
spending 50–100 million pounds for the privilege of
being associated with the Games (Beard and English,
2006). Johnson and Johnson paid the IOC approx-
imately 100 million dollars for a 4-year commitment
to Games and then an additional 57 million Euros to
activate their
the 2008 Beijing
Games (Radio Canada, 2008). The cost of the 2008
Beijing Games was estimated to have been around
44 billion dollars (Pravda.ru, 2008), which was far
more than any previous Games. The Games also
have an impact on local infrastructure, tourism, and
business leveraging (Chalip and Leyns, 2002; Parent,
2008; Preuss, 2005; Ritchie, 1984; Ritchie and
Smith, 1991). For example, various governmental

agencies have spent over 1 billion dollars in infra-
structure for the 2010 Vancouver Olympic and Pa-
ralympic Games. As well, the Games have several
negative impacts such as environmental damage and
low-income citizen displacement (Chappelet, 2008;
Lenskyj, 1996, 2000). Given such pejorative out-
comes, the concept of CSR seems intrinsic to the
IOC and its Olympic Movement. The IOC pro-
motes social responsibility as a means ‘‘… to provide
access to sports practice, and in so doing to spread
the values of sport to all sections of society’’ (Jacques
Rogge, IOC President). The IOC’s brand of CSR
comes in the form of four divergent practices: (1)
promotion of women in sport (i.e., set up a positive
trend to enhance women’s participation in sport at
all levels), (2) protection of athletes (i.e., attention to
protecting these ‘‘heroes’’ of the Games), (3) human
development assistance (i.e., social and economic
issues), and (4) sustainable development (i.e., greater
resources to sustainable development in and through
sport).

Current research on the Games has focused on
marketing and sponsorship (Madrigal, 2006; Se´guin
et al., 2005, 2008); economic and tourism impacts
(Chalip and Leyns, 2002; Crompton, 1995, 2004;
Gratton et al., 2006; Jinxia and Mangan, 2008); risk
and terrorism management (Atkinson and Young,
2002; Chappelet, 2001; Leopkey and Parent, 2009);
and political and social issues (Burbank et al., 2001;
Jinxia and Mangan, 2008; Whitson and Macintosh,
1993, 1996). However, limited research exists per-
taining to consumer awareness of and perceived
reputation directed towards the Games. Addition-
ally, such research has not touched upon CSR or its
relationship to any of these concepts. This lack of
work is somewhat startling given the widespread
positive and negative impact of the IOC and its
Games on the general population, businesses, and
even governments who,
for example, are now
passing laws to protect the Olympic brand (e.g., Bill
C-47 in Canada, Ellis et al., 2008). Given that the
ﬁeld of sport event management only dates back to
the 1980s, the lack of substantive research is not all
that surprising. Nevertheless, this means that much
work remains to build the literature by, for example,
linking various concepts such as consumer aware-
ness, stakeholders, and reputation. Currently, we
have little insight regarding the awareness levels of
consumers regarding the IOC’s social responsibility,

what consumer opinions are of these activities, how
their awareness and opinions
impact consumer
behavior (e.g., merchandise, ticket, and repeat pur-
chase), nor the impact of the CSR activities on the
IOC and its Games’ success/performance. Examin-
ing these relations is not only beneﬁcial for the ﬁeld
of sport/event management but could provide useful
information for other global NGOs
(e.g., UN,
UNESCO, Red Cross) and other major interna-
tional sport organizations (e.g., FIFA, IAAF) who
endorse and promote CSR.

Theoretical background

CSR awareness

Awareness of and consumer associations directed
towards corporate activity have been regarded as
critical elements in the development of what con-
sumers believe about an organization (Berens et al.,
2005; Brown and Dacin, 1997; Brown et al., 2006;
Milberg et al., 1997; Rao et al., 2004). Sen et al.
(2006) noted that consumer associations become
critical elements to stakeholder mind-share, because
this information has the power to inﬂuence indi-
viduals’ responses to the organization – particularly
towards a ﬁrm’s reputation. However, in the case of
CSR, consumers generally do not actively seek out
information about a company’s
social behavior
(Meijer and Schuyt, 2005). Hence, limited aware-
ness represents a key stumbling block in the orga-
nization’s quest to reap strategic rewards from CSR,
in general, and the associations that stakeholders
have of the organization, in particular (Bhattacharya
and Sen, 2004). In order for the organization to
beneﬁt from a potentially large spectrum of associ-
ations, it is necessary to generate awareness of CSR
as ‘‘… lack of awareness is a major inhibitor of
overall responsiveness to CSR’’ (Mohr et al., 2001,
p. 48).

Using awareness to identify consumers’ under-
standing of CSR is only a valid approach if
researchers can determine the effect of stakeholders’
internal beliefs regarding the motives
for social
engagement. For example, consumers may view the
IOC’s motives for CSR engagement in a number of
ways, including strategy (i.e., Does the organization
beneﬁt at all from the CSR activities?); a focus on


Olympic CSR & Consumer Attributions

organizational stakeholders (i.e., How does CSR
beneﬁt or satisfy salient stakeholder groups?); and/or
a focus on organizational values (i.e., Is CSR simply
the right thing to do?). These attributions connected
to consumer awareness of the IOC’s social efforts
may have a signiﬁcant impact on any short- or long-
term beneﬁts they might receive from their actions.
Ellen et al. (2006) maintained that consumers may
care more about why ﬁrms are engaged in CSR
rather than what types of CSR they endorse. Based
on this rationale and responding to Maignan’s (2001)
call for more research on consumer awareness of
social responsibility, CSR awareness was selected as
the primary interactive determinate of consumer
attributions. While researchers have alluded to the
importance of CSR awareness as a precursor to both
attitudinal and behavioral outcomes (Bhattacharya
and Sen, 2004; Du et al., 2007),
the aware-
ness ﬁ attributions link has yet to be examined.
Given that
the inputs of
rational choice (Schuler and Cording, 2006), we
argue that basic information (i.e., being aware of
CSR) coupled with the perceived motives behind
CSR engagement can lead to increasingly efﬁcient
consumer responses to CSR.

Consumer attributions

As mentioned, little is known about how consumers
construct their beliefs of CSR. Some presume that
awareness of CSR alone is a valid predictor of atti-
tudes and behavior. However, since researchers have
only begun to address the impact of CSR awareness
(see Bhattacharya and Sen, 2004; Du et al., 2007;
Maignan, 2001), attribution theory served as the
more appropriate guide for the current study (Jones
and Davis, 1965; Kelley, 1967, 1972). The under-
lying precept of attribution theory in the context of
CSR is that favorability towards a social program is
likely contingent on certain attributions consumers
make about the motives underpinning an organiza-
tion’s actions (Du et al., 2007; Ellen et al., 2006;
Klein and Dawar, 2004; Menon and Kahn, 2003;
Sen et al., 2006; Webb and Mohr, 1998). An attri-
bution (or corporate association) is what an indi-
vidual knows or feels about a particular organization
(Brown and Dacin, 1997). These associations ‘‘…
serve as
the organization for an

the ‘reality’ of

individual’’ (Brown et al., 2006, p. 105) and what
individuals believe can ultimately inﬂuence various
organizational responses.

Empirical consensus on classifying consumer
attributions still remains equivocal. Early attribution
work discussed principles such as legitimacy, public
responsibility, and managerial discretion (Wood,
1991) with the idea of stakeholder management
assuming a key role in CSR policy implementation
(Clarkson, 1995; Maignan et al., 1999; Wood,
1991). Swanson (1995) proposed a three-dimensional
model for CSR attributions consisting of a utilitarian
perspective (i.e., CSR as a strategic approach to
improve the bottom line), a negative duty perspec-
tive (i.e., CSR is undertaken to conform to stake-
holders’ values), and a positive duty perspective (i.e.,
CSR is undertaken because it is the right thing to
do). Later, Maignan and Ralston (2002) classiﬁed
consumer
three-dimensionally (i.e.,
values-driven, performance-driven, and stakeholder-
driven). More recently, Ellen et al. (2006) argued for
a two-dimensional framework reﬂecting either self-
(i.e., egoistic-, and strategic-driven) or other-centered
attributions (i.e., values-, stakeholder-driven).

attributions

(e.g.,

models into our theorizing, we argue that when
IOC consumers are aware of
the organization’s
social involvement, they are likely to elaborate on
that message by way of three speciﬁc attribution
effects
stakeholder-, and values-
driven). Based on previous work in this area
(Campbell and Kirmani, 2000; Ellen et al., 2006;
Maignan and Ralston, 2002), we know these speciﬁc
attributions are likely to inﬂuence consumer evalu-
ations of the ﬁrm. When motivations are considered
ﬁrm serving or proﬁt-related (i.e., strategic-driven),
attitudes toward the organization are likely to neg-
atively manifest; when motivations are considered
socially motivated (i.e., values-driven) or society/
community focused (i.e., stakeholder-driven), atti-
tudes toward the organization are likely enhanced
(Becker-Olsen et al., 2006).

Strategic goals inherent to a ﬁrm’s survival are
among the most widely accepted attributions (Ellen
et al., 2006). Yet, some CSR-related activities have
been criticized,

vance, or

(2009), however, maintained that unethical business
behavior have drawn intense media coverage,
thereby increasing the public’s attention to corrup-
tion – even in the nonproﬁt sector. Therefore, due
to heightened public cynicism directed toward
China, and consequently the IOC, we predict that
negative effects will
from strategic-driven
associations. On the other hand, values-driven
motives are related to altruistically motivated giving.
These motives are derived from individuals believing
that ﬁrms implement CSR because they care; thus,
positive effects for the current study are anticipated.
Finally,
stakeholder-driven motives relate to the
support of social causes due to stakeholder pressures.
While Vlachos et al. (2009) argued this attribution
seeks to avoid retribution, we believe the IOC’s
consumers may view these as responsive to their
needs and those of the wider world.

The motives underlying CSR have been used in
explaining consumer reactions to CSR (Godfrey,
2005). However, most have focused on the mod-
erating role of attributions to evaluate the strength of
the attributed relationships (see Klein and Dawar,
2004; Sen et al., 2006). Given the literature sug-
gesting awareness as an (albeit weak) antecedent to
behavior, and in line with additional work in this
area (Yoon et al., 2006), we hypothesized the
attributions as indirectly inﬂuencing the proposed
model rather than acting as moderators. Thus, we
expected awareness of CSR initiatives to be medi-
ated by a set of organization-speciﬁc attributions
pertaining to the thoughts and feelings of IOC
consumers.

H1: The attributions

(i.e., values-driven,

stake-
holder-driven, and strategic-driven) will (at least
partially) mediate the proposed relationships.
(a) Values-driven and (b) stakeholder-driven
attributions will yield positive consumer responses
while (c) strategic-driven attributions will yield
negative consumer responses.

and Wang, 1994; Hall, 1992, 1993; McMillan and
Joshi, 1998; Teece, 1998). Among these intangibles,
reputation has been regarded as one of the key ele-
ments in marketing and organizational positioning
(Amis, 2003; Hall, 1993; Herbig and Milewicz,
1993) and may constitute the bulk of the worth of
many organizations (Feldwick, 1996; Hall, 1992).

Recently, academics have become interested in
how reputation relates to CSR (Brammer and Pav-
elin, 2006; Fombrun, 2005) because elements of
responsibility have been viewed as key drivers of
reputation (Schnietz and Epstein, 2005; Tucker and
Melewar, 2005). Conversely, Hillenbrand and
Money (2007) argued that rather than an antecedent
of reputation, social responsibilities are key attributes
in terms of how an organization’s reputation is
judged. These equivocal arguments
that
further work needs to be done regarding CSR and
the attributions
relationship.
Through the accumulation of homogenous evalua-
tions of social performance though, consumers may
generate a lasting reputation of
the organization
(Logsdon and Wood, 2002) because they translate
past
social performance into expectative future
behavior. Based on prior research (Bhattacharya and
Sen, 2003; Klein and Dawar, 2004; Lichtenstein
et al., 2004; Sen et al., 2006), we argue the more
sincere (or altruistic) the motive, the more likely that
values-driven reactions will result. Conversely, the
more instrumental (or strategic) the motive,
the
more likely negative reactions will result. These
CSR-based associations are likely to engender
positive and/or negative attitudes toward the IOC
(Sen et al., 2006).

H3: CSR awareness will positively impact reputa-
tion when mediated by values-driven and
stakeholder-driven attributions but negative
impacts will be seen for strategic-driven attri-
butions.

age and socially conscious businesses (Brown and
Dacin, 1997; Mohr and Webb, 2005; Porter and

Kramer, 2002; Ricks, 2005), ﬁnding that credible
CSR associations inﬂuenced consumer attitudes to-
ward the organization. Corporate credibility is
therefore thought to inﬂuence purchase intent be-
cause consumers’ perceptions of corporate trust-
worthiness and expertise are part of the information
they use to judge organizational quality (Fombrun,
1996). Winters (1988) and Lafferty and Goldsmith
(1999) found that credibility had a positive effect on
corporate sales. Others have found that consumers’
purchase decisions are inﬂuenced by a company’s
good citizenship (Maignan and Ferrell, 2001;
Netemeyer et al., 2001), by a ﬁrm’s support of a
social cause (Ross et al., 1990–1991), by certain
corporate associations (Brown and Dacin, 1997), by
marketing with at least one social objective (Hoefﬂer
and Keller, 2002), by corporate identiﬁcation
(Bhattacharya and Sen, 2003), and by proactive
corporate giving (Ricks, 2005).

The positive link between CSR and consumer
patronage has incentivized organizations to devote
more energy toward such initiatives. In other words,
the lure of greater proﬁts has signiﬁcantly contrib-
uted to increased justiﬁcations for social activity,
shifting the debate from ‘‘whether’’
to ‘‘how’’
(Bhattacharya and Sen, 2004, p. 10). This increasing
commitment to CSR is fostered by the growing
sense that consumers
reward corporate citizens
through sustained patronage (Brown and Dacin,
1997; Klein and Dawar, 2004; Lichtenstein et al.,
2004; Luo and Bhattacharya, 2006; Sen and
Bhattacharya, 2001; Sen et al., 2006), particularly
within consumer-appropriate domains (Du et al.,
2007). However, since awareness is regarded as a
weak antecedent to intentions and few studies have
examined the inﬂuence of consumer attributions
and purchase intentions, we predict CSR awareness
will positively impact patronage toward the IOC if
perceived as values-driven or stakeholder-driven,
while strategic-driven attributions will have negative
effects.

H4: CSR awareness will positively impact patronage
intentions (i.e., word of mouth, repeat pur-
chase, and merchandise consumption) when
mediated by values-driven and stakeholder-
driven attributions, but negative impacts will be
seen for strategic-driven attributions.

The attribution model

Despite the growing importance of CSR to modern
organizations including the IOC, there are still few
studies that describe the attitudes and behaviors of
‘‘real-world’’ consumers
toward CSR and little
attention has been paid to intervening variables that
may inﬂuence consumer responses to the practice
(see Du et al., 2007; Ellen et al., 2006; Klein and
Dawar, 2004; Lichtenstein et al., 2004). While some
empirical work has
suggested consumers possess
positive attitudes toward CSR (Brown and Dacin,
1997; Creyer and Ross, 1997; Mohr and Webb,
2005; Mohr et al., 2001; Sen and Bhattacharya,
2001), understanding
their perceived motives
underpinning CSR is
infancy. Our
still
hypothesized model illustrates that the attributions
(i.e., stakeholder, values, and strategic) will indirectly
inﬂuence the effects that CSR awareness has on the
consumers’ perceived reputation and patronage
intentions directed toward the IOC (see Figure 1).

in its

Method

Sample

A research team collected data (via intercept tech-
nique) from attendees of the 2008 Beijing Olympic
Games representing 38 different nations over a
3-week period. The attendees were approached
outside the spectator entrances of several Olympic
venues and told that we were interested in their
opinions about the IOC’s social agenda. In total, 538
randomly selected attendees were identiﬁed and
were willing to participate in the research. To ensure
against any translational biases, the data collection
team was instructed to ask each respondent if they
spoke and read English. Additionally, a verbal
appraisal of the respondents’ connection to the Games
was also conducted to guard against any direct
stakeholder biases. This second step in the protocol
was performed for two reasons: (1) eliminate any
‘‘familiarity’’ responses that would bias the results
and be difﬁcult to interpret and (2) measure only
consumer responses rather than those of the internal
stakeholder’s who may possess only a limited (i.e.,
one-way) view of the IOC’s social initiatives.

individual differences, however,

Given that CSR is perceived differently across
cultures and has many (and sometimes conﬂicting)
deﬁnitions, made the respondents’ interpretation of
CSR critical to our analyses. Several recent studies
have investigated perceptual differences of CSR
dependant on country of origin (Maignan and Ral-
ston, 2002; Matten and Moon, 2008). These studies
concluded (in the aggregate) that CSR means dif-
ferent things to different people. Regardless of the
minutia of
the
collective consensus that CSR is enacted for societal
betterment is both implicitly and explicitly under-
stood in the global context (Matten and Moon,
2008). Thus, the IOC was selected as the focal
organization due to the international nature of their
CSR efforts, the world-wide publicity given to the
Games, and the public skepticism of
the social,
environmental, human rights issues surrounding this
mega-event (Minxin, 2008). The varied nature of
the IOC’s social programs, as well as the wide-spread
(both self-reported and popular press) attention
given to their activities, made the IOC’s consumers
an ideal group to assess both attitudinal and behav-
ioral outcomes, as well as the attributions they might
assign to their social
initiatives (McWilliams and

Siegel, 2001). The sample (on-site, random sam-
pling) in this study was appropriate because event
attendees are considered to be one of the primary
targets for the dissemination of socially responsive
information by the focal organization.

Analytic technique

We used existing scales for the measurement of the
constructs (see Table I), the deﬁnitions of which are
rooted in the extant literature. CSR awareness was
developed with guidance from previous literature
(Du et al., 2007; Sen et al., 2006). The attribution
measures were adopted from those developed by
Ellen et al. (2006). Intentions were measured using
three subscales adopted from the work of Walker
and Kent (2009). Reputation was measured using
items adopted from those developed by Gaines-Ross
(1998). Several minor changes were made to the
scale items to make them appropriate for this study.
Some of the behavioral items were adapted to ﬁt this
speciﬁc case.

The most rigid change that was made was to
from the

exclude the egoistic-driven construct

Matthew Walker et al.

supports our

rationale. Speciﬁcally,

attributions scale as developed by Ellen et al. (2006).
Conceptually, this construct is different from the
other three, in that the wording indicates a certain
negative judgment of organizational activities. How-
ever, if this connotation is removed, the items are
simply reﬂective of
strategic-driven attributions.
Previous attribution work by Maignan and Ralston
(2002)
the
exploratory factor analysis (EFA) performed by Ellen
and colleagues indicated a four-factor model, which
they ultimately put forth. Despite the results of the
factor analysis though, these ﬁndings lack sufﬁcient
support for hypothesis testing, as no conﬁrmatory
test of
this factor structure was performed. The
internal consistency of the egoistic factor indicates a
level below 0.80, suggesting the work is exploratory,
and according to Lance et al. (2006) still requires
additional reﬁnement. Since Ellen et al. (2006) failed
to perform a conﬁrmatory analysis, the validity and
reliability of their model remains unexplored. As
well, the reported factor loadings do raise concerns
in regards
to both discriminant and convergent
validity of the individual constructs. Irrespective of
validity issues, the wording of the egoistic items
raised concerns for us regarding their applicability to
organizations operating in a ‘‘nonproﬁt’’ manner as
they are geared toward for-proﬁt entities only. For
example, the following items were deemed to be
unrepresentative of a nonproﬁt, NGO: ‘‘They are
taking advantage of the nonproﬁt organization to
help their own business,’’ ‘‘They are taking advan-
tage of the cause to help their own business,’’ and
‘‘They want it as a tax write-off.’’

Ellen et al. (2006) conceptualized their constructs
based on two dimensions of CSR: (1) ‘‘self-centered’’
and (2) ‘‘other-centered.’’ It is questionable though
whether stakeholders’ attributions should be cate-
gorized under the ‘‘other-centered’’ label. After all,
many stakeholders could be regarded as having a
strong interest and/or stake in the organization,
thereby placing stakeholder-driven attributions on
the crossroads between the self- and other-centered
dimensions. Based on this, we made the choice to
remove the egoistic items and conﬁne our analyses
to a three-dimensional model. We propose that by
limiting ourselves
the full
spectrum of self- and other-centered motives was
covered. Values-driven is
‘‘other-
centered’’; stakeholder-driven is regarded as balancing

to three attributions,

regarded as

both ‘‘self’’ and ‘‘other’’ centered attributions; while
the strategic-driven attributions are seen ‘‘self-cen-

To assess the appropriateness of the scales in this
particular setting, reliability and internal consisten-
cies were examined using Cronbach’s Alpha, inter-
item correlations, and the item-to-total
statistics
(Hair et al., 2005). To assess the ﬁt and the rela-
tionships in the measurement model, we ﬁrst con-
ducted a CFA to assess the reliability and validity of
the model and the individual constructs. Next,
multivariate regression involving path analysis was
used to estimate the path coefﬁcients. Our analyses
then proceeded in two steps
to determine the
model’s validity and to assess whether the attribu-
tions served as mediators. In the ﬁrst step, we fol-
lowed the method outlined by Baron and Kenny
(1986)
(i.e., direct
effects) in the measurement model. To establish
mediation, three conditions must be met: (1) the
dependant variable predicted by the independent
variable; (2) the intervening variable predicted by
the independent variable; and (3) the dependant
variable predicted by the intervening variable. Full
mediation occurs if the independent variable has no
signiﬁcant effect on the dependent variable when the
intervening variable is controlled or
should be
reduced in strength for partial mediation (Baron and
Kenny, 1986). In the second step, Sobel’s (1982,
1986)
test was used to determine whether the
intervening variables carried the effects of the inde-
pendent variables onto the dependent variable. Sig-
niﬁcant
t-values would indicate the attribution
effects were important mediators.

Results

After the removal of incomplete questionnaires, 503
[male: 286 (57%); female: 217 (43%)] people were
utilized in the analysis. Respondent ages ranged from
18 to 72 and among the nations represented, the
following returned the highest numbers of willing

(8.9%), Australia = 24 (4.8%), Korea = 21 (4.2%),
Mexico = 20 (4.0%), England = 19 (3.8%), and
Germany = 15 (3.0%). Upon inspection of
the
means our ﬁndings are consistent with prior research

consumer awareness of CSR was generally low (63%
of the sample selected either 1 – ‘‘strongly disagree’’
or 2 – ‘‘disagree’’ on the CSR awareness items). The
mean scores for the other constructs were above the
scale midpoints (see Table II).

The reliabilities of the individual constructs were
robust, all Cronbach’s Alpha scores exceeded 0.70,
there were no problematic correlations between the
items and all item-to-total statistics were above the
0.50 cutoff (Hair et al., 2005). The overall generic
model supports our proposition revealing an accept-
able ﬁt to the data (v2/df = 2.669, p < 0.001; CFI =
0.93; NFI = 0.91; RMSEA = 0.058; SRMR =
0.049). We conducted two tests to ensure that our
constructs were acting independently. The ﬁrst dis-
criminant validity test was based on the squared
correlations relative to the AVE score for each
construct (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). None of the
squared correlations exceeded the lowest AVE score
(0.54), thereby fulﬁlling the requirements of this test.
The second discriminant validity test was conducted
on all pairs of constructs whose correlation exceeded
0.30. Each pair of constructs was not perfectly cor-
related, providing further evidence that discrimina-
tion among the constructs was achieved (Anderson
and Gerbing, 1988).

risk of correlated errors, the regressions were con-

from the independent variable (awareness) to the

Table III). Baron and Kenny’s (1986) ﬁrst condition
for mediation requires that the independent and
dependent variables in an analysis be signiﬁcantly
related. Due to the insigniﬁcant relationships in step
three (see ‘‘Direct Effect Model’’ column in
Table III), the testing results provide only partial
support for Baron and Kenny’s (1986) third condi-
tion. However, the real strength of mediation is
determined after controlling for the mediating vari-
ables (consumer attributions). When this control is
performed,
(CSR
awareness) on the dependent variables (patronage
intentions) should no longer be signiﬁcant for full
mediation or should be reduced in strength for
partial mediation (Baron and Kenny, 1986, p. 1177).
When this was done, the patronage outcomes were
all nonsigniﬁcant suggesting the attributions fully
mediated the relationship (see ‘‘Full Mediation’’
column in Table III). Sobel’s
test
conﬁrmed this result as signiﬁcant t-values across the
outcomes indicated the attributions were important
mediators in the model (see Table III).

CFI = 0.92). Due to the similarity of the model
testing results (and beyond simply ‘‘eye-balling’’ the
ﬁt
indices), we used two additional criteria to
determine the best ﬁt: (1) the percentage of signiﬁ-
cant paths and (2) parsimony, as measured by the
PNFI index. With the exception of the nonmedia-
tion model (which ﬁt the data signiﬁcantly worse
than the two other competing models), Model ‘‘B’’
had fewer signiﬁcant paths than Model ‘‘A’’ and was
less parsimonious.

After determining the path structure, a rival-models

representing the best ﬁt. The comparison was be-
tween three models in which CSR awareness carried

itively predicted patronage intentions and reputation
when mediated by one of the three attributions.
A major tenet of this research was the central role of
consumer attributions in the CSR awareness–repu-
tation–patronage relationship. The hypothesis test-
ing results (see Table IV) fully support H1 in that the
attributions fully mediated the model. Second, the
positive effects seen for values-driven (H2a) and
stakeholder-driven (H2b), as well as the negative
effect seen for strategic-driven attributions (H2c),
lend support to our directional hypothesis. Third,
the results partially support H3 in that overall posi-
tive effects on reputation were seen for stakeholder-
driven (b = 0.320, p < 0.001) and values-driven
(b = 0.392, p < 0.001) attributions; however, no
negative effects resulted from the strategic-driven
attributions. Fourth, the results support H4 because
positive effects
for both stakeholder-driven and
values-driven attributions on patronage intentions
were seen, as well as one negative effect for strategic-
driven attributions (see Figure 2).

Discussion

This research examined the mediational role of
consumer attributions on consumer responses. We

extended the research on CSR-induced attributions
(in the NGO context), positing them as indirectly
inﬂuencing patronage intentions and reputation.
The motives that Olympic consumers ascribed to the
IOC’s CSR initiatives were examined in the real
marketplace to construct an externally valid picture
of this seemingly complex phenomenon. In doing
so, we sought to clarify if and how both negative and
positive connotations of the IOC were reﬂected in
consumers’ attributions directed toward the organi-
zation. Our work revealed that within a NGO
context, stakeholder-driven and values-driven attri-
butions (as opposed to strategic-driven attributions)
toward CSR may be more profound than within a
business context and can inﬂuence both relational
(i.e., reputation) and transactional (i.e., patronage
intentions) consumer responses.

Among the most interesting ﬁndings was that
CSR awareness had a greater effect on stakeholder
(b = 0.466) and values-driven (b = 0.400) than on
strategic-driven attributions (b = 0.180).

This implies that raising consumer awareness of
CSR might
inﬂuence their perception from a
stakeholder- and/or values-driven perspective but it
will not alter their strategic-driven perception. Any
new information perceived through this attribution
is essentially ignored and reafﬁrms the consumers’

perception of the motives of the organization for
CSR activities. When the IOC’s consumers assigned
either stakeholder- or values-driven attributions to
CSR,
the inﬂuence on both reputation and
patronage was far more impactful. Du et al. (2007)
found similar results concluding that consumers are
more responsive (or sensitive) to favorable CSR
attributes (i.e., intrinsic attributes such as a com-
pany’s record for CSR). However, the weak positive
relationship between CSR awareness and strategic-
driven attributions indicates that those consumers
who view an action undertaken by the IOC for
strategic reasons may not be easily converted to
support more altruistic beliefs. In fact,
it might
strengthen their current view of the organization
thereby reducing any positive CSR effects that exist.
This ﬁnding extends the results of Vlachos et al.
(2009) who found that suspicious consumers tend to
entertain mainly negative CSR attributions, which
can negatively inﬂuence both internal and external
responses. Thus, the suspicion that CSR may, for
some consumers, serve as a fashionable label rather
than a substantive concept derives from the view that
perceived instrumental motives underlying CSR
actions diminish favorability toward CSR. Even
though IOC consumers expect the organization to
behave in socially acceptable ways due to their
‘‘Olympism’’ moniker, they do feel their actions to
be motivated at least in part by self-interest. More
speciﬁcally, when consumers elaborated on CSR
awareness and connected an attribute, the idea of
suspicion and elements of the persuasion knowledge

model (Friestad and Wright, 1994, 1995) may par-
tially explain their responses. This model describes
how people’s previous knowledge of organizational
goals impacts their response to persuasion attempts.
For example, when the consumers regarded CSR as
strategic (i.e., self-interested), it had either no impact
on patronage intentions, or when it came to repeat
purchase – it had a negative impact. Therefore,
when consumers perceive CSR to be implemented
for self-centered reasons, it loses effectiveness and
can even result in negative responses (Brown and
Dacin, 1997; Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001; Vlachos
et al., 2009). However, further work still remains to
clarify the conditions under which such positive and
negative attributions toward CSR will or will not
affect consumer intentions and behaviors.

Another explanation for the strong meditational
inﬂuence of stakeholder- and values-driven attribu-
tions might be caused by the NGO context of our
study and may also be a result of the pressures imposed
by the IOC’s stakeholders and society to undertake
CSR-related activities for an internal, normative
reason (i.e., the ‘‘right thing to do’’) rather than purely
strategic (i.e., selﬁsh) reasons. However, this attitu-
dinal pattern seems to still personally resonate with the
respondents and is not really affected by self-centered
motives because consumers may simply believe in the
IOC. Due to the nature of the IOC’s operations,
consumers may expect adherence to their nonproﬁt
roots, as opposed to for-proﬁt sport organizations (e.g.,
Nike), for which consumers expect to focus on stra-
tegic issues to increase their competitive advantage.


Olympic CSR & Consumer Attributions

673

Due to the history and origin of the IOC, its con-
sumers expect it to act on behalf of its stakeholders and
society in general. Consequently, if the IOC (a non-
proﬁt organization) is seen undertaking activities
which society mostly associates with for-proﬁt orga-
nizations (i.e., self-centered), consumer intentions
and behaviors could be negatively impacted. This has
wider-reaching implications for other global NGOs
to stay true to their original stated purpose.

Another noteworthy ﬁnding was the strong and
positive inﬂuence that stakeholder-driven attribu-
tions had on the outcomes. We believe the reason
behind such strong predictive power of this attri-
bution set to be twofold. First, the IOC (as with
many global NGOs) is surrounded by a number of
stakeholders (e.g., governments, national and inter-
national sport organizations, media, and sponsors)
who are important to the operations of the organi-
zation. All of these stakeholders may carry expecta-
tions that the IOC performs in their best interests
similar to other global NGOs (e.g., UNESCO). This
became apparent during the 2002 Salt Lake City
Games when allegations of bribery and bidding
scandals changed the bidding rules for all subsequent
Olympic Games. These changes forced the IOC to
reevaluate its own organization, thereby distancing
itself from some of its members (Jennings, 2000). It
appears that self-serving activities of the IOC are
indeed monitored and can be inﬂuenced by key
stakeholders, representing a form of control that is
rewarded by consumers. Therefore,
the strong
relationship between stakeholder-driven attributions
and the outcomes may only be speciﬁc to this study,
and the results may be limited to organizations
similar to the IOC (e.g., FIFA, IAAF, United
Nations, UNESCO, etc.). Second, it could be a
result of our sampling, which may constitute an
inherent limitation when studying organizations like
the IOC. The questionnaires were distributed to the
visitors of the 2008 Games; and upon reﬂection,
many of these individuals – in line with stakeholder
theory – might actually have been (directly or
indirectly) connected to the IOC (irrespective of our
screening processes). For example, the respondents
could have been associated with the IOC’s corporate
partners, members of the media, or other profes-
sional
indirectly connected to the
Games. This rationale supports the general trend in
the organizational
literature suggesting that stake-

associations

holders play a more central role than previously
thought (Parent, 2008). In fact, today, the media
(53% of total revenues) and corporate sponsors (34%
of
revenues) have replaced the traditional
consumer (11% of total revenues) as the main source
of
the organization (International
Olympic Committee, 2009b).

Contributions to attribution theory

that

From an attribution theory perspective, CSR
activities undertaken by the IOC are driven by the
organization’s hope that consumers will draw certain
correspondent inferences (Yoon et al., 2006). Thus,
when observing an organization that
supports
worthwhile causes, consumers will hopefully attri-
bute positive motives to the organization, thereby
fostering or improving its reputation. Our ﬁndings
support this rationale by illustrating the signiﬁcant
inﬂuence
attributions have on consumer
intentions and attitudes. However, our ﬁndings go
against the propositions in the product/brand liter-
ature (Weiner, 2000), as well as the CSR-based
attribution literature (Bhattacharya and Sen, 2001;
Klein and Dawar, 2004), suggesting that consumers’
attributions are more pronounced following nega-
tive rather than positive information. For example,
Bhattacharya and Sen (2001)
found consumers’
company evaluations to be more sensitive to nega-
tive CSR information than positive CSR informa-
tion. The attributional principle of
subjective
likelihood addresses
this positive/negative issue,
stating that if an attribution (whether positive or
negative) is ascribed to a positive and stable cause
(one that is enduring over time) then the same
outcome will be anticipated in the future. On the
other hand, ascription to an unstable cause (one that
is
socially irresponsible)
will diminish or negatively impact the attributed
response almost immediately (Weiner, 2000).

temporary and perhaps

Given these ideas, and in contrast to the work of
Ellen et al. (2006), we expected strategic-driven
attributions to negatively inﬂuence the outcomes
due to the negative media attention given to the
IOC in the months and weeks preceding the Games
(e.g., Tibet and the environment). Ricks (2005)
argued that when organizations react to negative
information, it is likely to result in some level of


674

Matthew Walker et al.

negative affect for the consumer, which may over-
shadow a previously held positive view of
the
organization. This could be partially explained by
subjective likelihood. For example, the issues sur-
rounding the Games only received attention in the
months preceding the Games (versus tickets being
typically sold over a year in advance). Thus, the
beliefs
that Olympic consumers held were not
inﬂuenced to the extent an impact on the outcomes
could be seen, and 2 years between Games, may
weaken any previously held negative perceptions of
the IOC. Although the act of supporting CSR may
seem to be a public serving action, consumers’
perceptions of
and values-driven
motivations drove their evaluations of the IOC. Our
ﬁndings also conﬁrmed (at least in this context) that
a motive viewed as strategic can lead to a negative
ﬁrm-level outcome. While Ellen et al. (2006) found
that strategic attributions yielded positive consumer
responses (i.e., when both strategic- and values-
driven motives were attributed simultaneously),
when testing the multiplicative effects of the attri-
butions, we found them to be mutually exclusive –
that is – consumers only assigned one set of attri-
butions to the IOC.

stakeholder-

While empirical evidence suggests that organiza-
tions with poor CSR records experience signiﬁ-
cantly negative consequences when their records
become public (Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001), this
was seemingly not the case even in light of the
negative publicity directed toward the IOC and
BOCOG. Apparently, even if consumers were
aware of any efforts to deﬂect negativity surrounding
the Games, it had no substantive inﬂuence (other
than a negative effect on repeat purchase). Perhaps
the IOC’s Olympism values and brand/reputation
may (now) be strong enough to weather periodic
negative press.

Implications

From the results, a few notable conclusions emerged.
First, one of the unique contributions of this article
was the use of the attribution literature to assess
consumer perceptions of CSR performed by a
nonproﬁt, global, NGO. There is growing interest
among NGO managers
in the antecedents and
consequence of CSR. These corporate managers are

mindful that business norms and standards, regula-
tory frameworks, and stakeholder demand for CSR
can vary substantially across nations, regions, and
lines of business. They are also aware that their
divisional managers are under constant pressure from
employees, suppliers, community groups, and the
government to increase their involvement in CSR.
However, research on the nonproﬁt side of the
NGO equation is relatively under-researched. In
particular, little is known about the effects that CSR
initiatives might have on nonproﬁts or, moreover,
how the typical consumer ascribes the motives be-
hind the social engagement of these entities. Despite
the obvious beneﬁts
the
organizations, CSR initiatives can be particularly
risky for nonproﬁts, which usually are (by their
nature) less powerful organizations, and CSR strat-
egies may not ultimately serve the nonproﬁt’s long-

The consumer attributions were identiﬁed as a

consumer patronage and reputation. Our results of
the signiﬁcant CSR awareness ﬁ attributions ﬁ

IOC’s social responsibility could signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
ence the perceived motives underlying CSR, and
those perceived motives mediate the transactional

reputation)
rewards accrued for the IOC. These mediating
effects are important for three reasons. First, by using
the attributions as mediators our work extends the
CSR literature by using a relatively new (and still
emerging) construct in the CSR awareness–outcome
relationship. Although prior work has noted that
CSR awareness could and should affect stakeholders’
perceived organizational motives,
the construct
has not until recently been empirically examined.

patronage/reputation causal chain extends the attri-

can be an important antecedent (albeit weakly) to
the attributions posited by Ellen et al. (2006). Third,
the relationship from CSR awareness to the attri-
butions to intentions/reputation suggests that achiev-
ing positively perceived motives behind CSR
engagement represents one of the underlying path-

ways through which consumer patronage and per-
ceived reputation on the basis of CSR awareness is
realized.

Second, and also regarding to the attributions, a
conceptual contribution of this work pertains the
manner in which the attributions were measured.
We revised the Ellen et al.
(2006) attribution
framework making it congruent with previous
conceptual work in this area. The authors intro-
duced four dimensions to the attribution framework
(in lieu of
several preceding three-dimensional
models), but failed to support this both conceptually
and empirically. By removing the egoistic construct,
this study resulted in a strong three-dimensional
model that is applicable to nonproﬁt NGOs as well
as for-proﬁt organizations. In addition, this article
makes the distinction between awareness and the
attributions,
acknowledging them as mediators
rather than indicators of CSR awareness. This makes
conceptual sense, in that there must ﬁrst be aware-
ness of CSR to elicit any positive and/or negative
responses
In
essence, awareness was revealed as an important
antecedent
that consumers/
stakeholders might
assign to the organization.
However, given the low mean score for CSR
awareness it appears that even being mildly aware of
CSR can still be impactful for the organization.

Third (from a practical perspective), the IOC
should emphasize the importance of consumer per-

social outreach. Consumer responses to CSR are

communication is high, making
these communications of suspect value – especially
regarding the heightened attention surrounding the
2008 Games. For ﬁrms that wish to derive the most
beneﬁt
from their CSR initiatives, our ﬁndings
conﬁrm that while awareness of CSR is a key
determinate for the attribution effects, consumer
awareness of such initiatives was rather low. This
ﬁnding illustrates that many consumers are com-
pletely unaware of the breadth of CSR activities
with which the IOC was involved (illustrated by the
low mean score for CSR awareness; M = 3.03). In
general, the level of
information regarding most

CSR initiatives
is often forwarded by the ﬁrm
through the media or even activists seeking to dis-
credit the organization (McWilliams et al., 2006)
through biased reporting that cannot be controlled
(Parent and Foreman, 2007). Based on this, IOC
executives should develop communication strategies
that provide details to salient stakeholder groups
about how their organization has addressed various
social issues (Porter and Kramer, 2006), speciﬁcally
focused on values-driven and stakeholder-driven
attributions. Further, our results indicate that orga-
nizations operating in similar contexts to the IOC
should strategically integrate CSR into their com-
petitive positioning by designing programs
that
reinforce consumers’ perceptions of CSR working
for them or beneﬁting society. This
tactic may
assuage any negative effects that strategically per-
ceived motives might potentially evoke.

Conclusions

Taken together, this study stresses the importance of
incorporating attribution judgments of the consumer
into the evaluation of organizational CSR practices.
Each of the attributions had a unique inﬂuence on
the outcomes, and it appears important for the IOC
to fully understand what attributions consumers at-
tach to their CSR initiatives. In particular, when
consumers perceive CSR to be implemented for
strategic reasons, the effectiveness of the CSR falls
away and can even cause ‘‘diminishing returns’’ for
the organization. The apparent disconnect between,
notably, the attributed motives toward the IOC’s
activities, their core values, and stakeholder pressure
to perform in an international context seems to point
to a more complex relationship which certainly re-
quires further study. Our results suggest that real-
world consumers possess limited awareness of CSR
activities but when certain attributions were attached
as
the IOC capitalized through
patronage and reputation. The presence of favorable
attributions that may be unique to the IOC is critical
to the overall success of their CSR strategy. For
example, when CSR becomes more prominent,
IOC leaders would do well to consider positioning
the messages toward organizational values and rele-
vant stakeholders so they contribute to the cycle of
organizational success. Conversely, messages deliv-

ered at the strategic level may push consumers to
perceive them as tactical maneuvers designed to
mislead, which would also run contrary to NGOs’
perceived core purpose.
