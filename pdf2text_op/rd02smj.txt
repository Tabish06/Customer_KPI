Good corporate reputations are critical because of their potential for value creation, but also
because their intangible character makes replication by competing ﬁrms considerably more
difﬁcult. Existing empirical research conﬁrms that there is a positive relationship between
reputation and ﬁnancial performance. This paper complements these ﬁndings by showing that
ﬁrms with relatively good reputations are better able to sustain superior proﬁt outcomes over
time. In particular, we undertake an analysis of the relationship between corporate reputation
and the dynamics of ﬁnancial performance using two complementary dynamic models. We
also decompose overall reputation into a component that is predicted by previous ﬁnancial
performance, and that which is ‘left over’, and ﬁnd that each (orthogonal) element supports
the persistence of above-average proﬁts over time. Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A growing body of research argues that good
corporate reputations have strategic value for the
ﬁrms that possess them (Dierickx and Cool, 1989;
Rumelt, 1987; Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). Acc-
ording to a resource-based view, ﬁrms with assets
that are valuable and rare possess a competitive
advantage and may expect to earn superior returns.
Those whose assets are also difﬁcult to imitate
may achieve sustained superior ﬁnancial perfor-
mance (Barney, 1991; Grant, 1991). Within this
line of reasoning, intangible assets—such as good
reputations—are critical because of their poten-
tial for value creation, but also because their
intangible character makes replication by com-
peting ﬁrms considerably more difﬁcult. Not sur-
prisingly, several studies conﬁrm the expected
beneﬁts associated with good reputations (Fom-
brun and Shanley, 1990; Herremans, Akathaporn,
and McInnes, 1993; Landon and Smith, 1997;

McGuire, Schneeweis, and Branch, 1990; Podolny,
1993). However, no research to date has looked at
the extent to which a good reputation at a point in
time allows superior ﬁnancial performance to per-
sist over time. In other words, they stop short of
fully addressing ‘how ﬁrms get to be good [and]
how they sometimes stay that way’ (Teece, Pisano,
and Shuen, 1997: 530, emphasis added). Barney
(2001: 51) agrees that this is an important over-
sight when noting that ‘the conditions under which
resources developed or acquired in one period have
implications for the strategic advantages of ﬁrms
in subsequent periods—is particularly important.’
This paper ﬁlls this gap by examining the rela-
tionship between reputation and the persistence of
superior proﬁt outcomes over time.

The focus of this paper is on the impact of cor-
porate reputation on the path of future ﬁnancial
performance. However, reputation research sug-
gests that a reputation–performance effect may
operate in both directions: a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial per-
formance affects its reputation and its reputation
affects its performance (McGuire et al., 1990).
To accommodate this issue, our analysis accounts

for the fact that a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance
history affects its current reputation. More speciﬁ-
cally, we decompose each ﬁrm’s overall reputation
into a component that is predicted by its previ-
ous ﬁnancial performance (ﬁnancial reputation),
and that which is ‘left over’ (residual reputation).
We then consider the evidence for a residual repu-
tation effect. Such an effect would indicate that
reputation-building activities that have no posi-
tive impact on current ﬁnancial performance (e.g.,
McDonalds’ houses for sick children or Phillip
Morris’s anti-smoking campaigns) are still criti-
cal as they generate reputation assets that allow
above-average proﬁts to persist over time.

To forge a link between theorizing about reputa-
tion and the concern with sustained superior ﬁnan-
cial performance, we ﬁrst summarize the strategic
beneﬁts of good reputations and establish that good
reputations have properties that make them dif-
ﬁcult to imitate (at least in the short term) by
competing ﬁrms. This is followed by an empiri-
cal study based on 15 years (1984–98) of repu-
tation data contained in Fortune’s Most Admired
Corporations data ﬁle. The paper concludes by
summarizing our ﬁndings and proposing avenues
for future research.

performance. Following Fombrun (1996: 72), we
deﬁne reputation as ‘a perceptual representation
of a company’s past actions and future prospects
that describe the ﬁrm’s overall appeal to all its
key constituents when compared to other leading
rivals.’1 As such, ‘we view reputation as a global
perception of the extent to which an organization
is held in high esteem or regard’ (Weiss, Anderson,
and MacInnis, 1999: 75). This deﬁnition suggests
that corporate reputation is a general organizational
attribute that reﬂects the extent to which external
stakeholders see the ﬁrm as ‘good’ and not ‘bad.’
Where do good reputations come from? At
a very general
level, ‘reputation is determined
by the value (quality) of the actor’s previous
efforts’ (Podolny and Phillips, 1996: 455). In many
cases, the ﬁrm’s external constituencies may iden-
tify these efforts. As such, managers engage in
explicit reputation-building activities (e.g., adver-
tising, sponsorships) in order to improve their
ﬁrms’ reputations (Fombrun, 1996). They also
manage the set of associations that form with
exchange partners to ensure that they beneﬁt from
the network transmission of organizational repu-
tation or status (Podolny, 1994). However, exter-
nal constituencies do not directly observe the full
range of activities that
lead them to form the

THE STRATEGIC VALUE OF A GOOD
REPUTATION

The position taken in this paper is that a good rep-
utation is a valuable asset that allows a ﬁrm to
achieve persistent proﬁtability, or sustained supe-
rior ﬁnancial performance. With this in mind, we
must be precise about how we deﬁne reputa-
tion, the factors that contribute to its development,
and how it inﬂuences current and future ﬁnancial

1 There are other ways to think of a ﬁrm’s reputation. Since
Kreps and Wilson (1982), economists have examined the extent
to which ﬁrm reputations have implications for equilibrium con-
ﬁgurations of conduct and performance in markets characterized
by uncertainty (Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). While some anal-
yses focus on a ﬁrm’s reputation for toughness or aggression
(Milgrom and Roberts, 1982), others have developed models
wherein ﬁrms may earn a ﬁnancial return—or indeed a pre-
mium—on their reputations for quality when consumers value
product or service quality, but can not make the appropriate
observations in advance of purchase (Shapiro, 1983). Here, a
reputation is valuable because it serves as a signal of underlying
quality.

impressions that comprise an overall reputation.
They may therefore rely on previous ﬁnancial
performance outcomes as signals of a ﬁrm’s over-
all esteem (see Figure 1). This is the organizational
variant of Shapiro’s (1983) product-level analysis.
Just as previous demonstrations of quality lead to a
reputation for product quality, previous demonstra-
tions of overall ﬁnancial performance lead stake-
holders to believe that a company is ‘good.’

A variety of potential beneﬁts of good
reputations provide the rationale for a cross-
sectional
relationship between reputation and
ﬁnancial performance (Fombrun, 1996; Podolny,
1993). Because
reputation is valued in its
own right, customers value associations and
transactions with high-reputation ﬁrms. Because
reputation also serves
the
underlying quality of a ﬁrm’s products and
services, consumers may pay a premium for the
offerings of high-reputation ﬁrms, at
in
markets characterized by high levels of uncertainty
(Shapiro, 1983). A ﬁrm with a good reputation
may also possess a cost advantage because,
ceteris paribus, employees prefer to work for
high-reputation ﬁrms, and should therefore work
harder, or for lower remuneration. At the same
time, because suppliers are less concerned about
contractual hazards when transacting with high-
reputation ﬁrms, good reputations should also lead
to lower contracting and monitoring costs. These
direct beneﬁts are complemented by a number of
ancillary beneﬁts. Goldberg and Hartwick (1990)
suggest that potential customers receive (especially
extreme) advertising claims more favorably if the
reputation of the ﬁrm making those claims is
more positive. Along similar lines, the marketing
literature suggests that a good reputation supports
and enhances
force effectiveness, new
product introductions and recovery strategies in the
event of crises (Dowling, 2001). Finally, Benjamin
and Podolny (1999) demonstrate that investments
in quality made by California wineries experienced
a higher pay-off if the winery in question had a
better reputation.

sales

For a corresponding dynamic relationship bet-
ween reputation and sustained superior ﬁnancial
performance, we must also argue that reputa-
tion differences across ﬁrms are relatively stable
over time (Barney, 2001; Henderson and Cock-
burn, 1994). There is little doubt among strat-
egy researchers that a good reputation is difﬁ-
cult, if not impossible to replicate in the short

term (Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Rumelt, 1987).
Because reputations are complex and the main
drivers of reputation creation are embedded inside
the ﬁrm (Dowling, 2001), they are likely to be
associated with a high degree of causal ambigu-
ity, which reduces the extent to which competi-
tors may imitate them. This is consistent with
economic and sociological analyses of reputation.
Reputation assumes an important role when there
is uncertainty about the underlying quality of a
ﬁrm’s offerings. This same uncertainty makes it
difﬁcult for competing ﬁrms to quickly make qual-
ity demonstrations that would offset the signal-
ing beneﬁts associated with a good reputation.
Finally, Podolny (1993) suggests that the positive
interactions between reputation and other salient
ﬁrm features or actions (e.g., production costs,
or investments in product quality and advertis-
ing) create a virtuous cycle, wherein ﬁrms with
good reputations have a greater incentive to engage
in actions that further enhance their reputations.
These dynamic properties of ﬁrm reputation sug-
gest that reputation differences should demonstrate
a relatively high degree of persistence over time.
This proposition—in conjunction with the pur-
ported beneﬁts of a good reputation—supports the
hypothesis that is tested in this paper; namely that
a good reputation will enhance a ﬁrm’s ability to
sustain superior ﬁnancial performance over time.

therefore necessary to move away from cross-
sectional models and towards those that capture
the intertemporal behavior of ﬁrm proﬁtability.
Such a movement has already occurred within
the industrial organization economics literature,
spurred by scholars interested in persistent prof-
itability. Mueller (1986) was the ﬁrst to suggest
that
the autoregressive properties of ﬁrm-level
proﬁt time series reﬂect whether, and how fast,
abnormal proﬁts converge upon normal long-run
levels. The general approach is to estimate the fol-
lowing ﬁrst-order autoregressive model:
= α0 + β0 ∗ roait−1 + εit

less an indicator of normal proﬁts. As Geroski
(1990) explains, this model is a reduced-form rep-
resentation of a more complex dynamic model
wherein high proﬁts attract competition, which
subsequently lowers proﬁtability. The β0 param-
eter—or the persistence parameter—indicates the
rate at which abnormal proﬁts converge upon long
run levels. An estimate that is not signiﬁcantly
different from one indicates that abnormal prof-
its persist indeﬁnitely. More generally, the higher
is β0, the more persistent are abnormal proﬁt out-
comes. The α0 parameter indicates the level upon
which proﬁts converge in the long run. An estimate
that is signiﬁcantly greater than zero indicates that
ﬁrms earn relatively high long-run proﬁts. There-
fore, higher values of α0 also indicate greater proﬁt
persistence.

(1986), other

researchers
turned their attention to the persistent proﬁtabil-
ity question (Cubbin and Geroski, 1987; Jacobson,
1988; McGahan and Porter, 1999; Roberts, 1999;
Waring, 1996). There is now considerable evi-
dence suggesting that abnormal proﬁts erode over
time. There is also evidence that some ﬁrms are
shielded from the competitive pressures that oth-
erwise erode favorable proﬁt positions. In light of
these results, it is interesting to determine which
factors are responsible for the variance in proﬁt
persistence across ﬁrms. In the current context, we
ask whether a ﬁrm’s reputation exerts a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on a ﬁrm’s proﬁt persistence. We there-
fore estimate the following variant of Equation 1:
+ α2 ∗ MTBit−1

roait

= α0 + α1 ∗ Reputationit−1
+ α3 ∗ Sizeit−1 + β0 ∗ roait−1
+ β1 ∗ Reputationit−1
∗ roait−1
+ β2 ∗ MTBit−1 ∗ roait−1
+ β3 ∗ Sizeit−1 ∗ roait−1 + εit

(1a)

where Reputationit−1 is the one period lag of the
reputation of ﬁrm i relative to its corresponding
industry average. Our reputation hypothesis pre-
dicts positive estimates for α1 and β1. A positive
β1 indicates that the abnormal proﬁts earned by
ﬁrms with good reputations converge more slowly
upon long run levels. A positive α1 indicates that
ﬁrms with relatively good reputations earn higher
proﬁts in the long run.

MTBit−1 and Sizeit−1 are similar (mean-adjusted)
measures of relative market-to-book value (mar-
ket value divided by total shareholder’s equity)

and ﬁrm size (total sales). Relative market-to-book
value is an important control variable in this model
for two reasons. First, just as good reputations
help ﬁrms to sustain superior proﬁtability, so too
may their other intangible assets. Hall (1993: 609)
suggests that one indicator of intangible assets is
the ratio of the market value to the book value
of the ﬁrm. The higher is this ratio, the greater
is the proportion of a ﬁrm’s asset base that is in
intangible form. Second, the measure of reputation
used in this study is based on the perceptions of
senior company managers and directors, as well
as associated industry analysts (see the following
discussion of the data). While the use of a per-
ceptual measure of reputation poses no problems
per se (Benjamin and Podolny, 1999; Dowling,
2001), there may be concern about the ﬁnancial
orientation of these respondents. One might sus-
pect that the reputation scores that are reported
are confounded by the respondents’ expectations
of the ﬁrms’ future ﬁnancial performance. In other
words, higher reputation scores may be given to
ﬁrms that are expected to perform well in future
years. Inclusion of the market-to-book value vari-
able eases this concern because it captures the
market’s expectations of future economic returns
(Mueller, 1990). The ﬁrm size variable is also
included as size is thought to enhance a ﬁrm’s
ability to sustain a competitive advantage when
economies of scale, economies of scope, or learn-
ing effects are present.

To be more speciﬁc about the effects of rep-
utation on the persistence of superior vs. below-
average proﬁts, we estimate two additional sets of
models, ﬁrst using observations for which roait−1 is
greater than zero (a superior performance sample)
and then using observations for which roait−1 is
less than zero (a below-average performance sam-
ple) (Roberts, 1999).

Proportional hazards regression

There may be problems relying exclusively on an
autoregressive approach to studying proﬁt dynam-
ics. First, it forces researchers to assume that there
exists some long-run rate of return—a stance that
some may ﬁnd problematic. Researchers may be
less interested in uncovering the long-run proﬁt
level and the eventual path leading to it, and more
concerned with the length of time that ﬁrms spend
earning returns above those earned by compet-
ing ﬁrms (Hunt and Morgan, 1995). Second, the

Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 1077–1093 (2002)


autoregressive proﬁt models assume that period-
to-period changes in ﬁrm proﬁtability are grad-
ual, or incremental. However, current theorizing
also embraces the more dramatic types of change
associated with Schumpeter’s process of creative
destruction (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Rumelt,
1984, 1987). This interest in more discontinuous
proﬁtability changes suggests that researchers use
an approach that explicitly models the timing of
discrete performance events. In light of these con-
cerns, we also employ a complementary event
history approach to modeling sustained superior
performance.

The aim of event history analysis is to deter-
mine which factors inﬂuence the amount of time
an organization expects to remain in any given
state. More speciﬁcally,
it relates the probabil-
ity of an event occurring at a point in time to
some set of hypothesized explanatory variables.
We propose that movements between superior and
below-average performance positions can be ana-
lyzed in such a fashion if one accepts that an event
refers to the movement of a ﬁrm from one per-
formance state to the other. In such analysis, the
dependent variable—the hazard rate—expresses
the probability of exiting a superior (or below-
average) performance position at time t given that
an exit has not occurred prior to that time (Han-
nan, 1989). A smaller hazard rate corresponds to
greater performance sustainability, as it implies
that a ﬁrm is expected to remain in its cur-
rent proﬁt position for a longer period of time.
In proportional hazards regression,
the covari-
ates—which may vary over time—are assumed
to have a log-linear relationship with the haz-
ard rate. Covariates (in this case, the lagged val-
ues of relative reputation, market-to-book value,
and ﬁrm size) that exert a negative inﬂuence on
the hazard rate have a positive impact on the
length of time spent in a superior performance
position.2

As this suggests, event history analysis provides
researchers with a complementary approach to

2 In this paper, proportional hazards regression is used to study
movements between two performance states. In future research,
other models may be employed, including exponential, Gom-
pertz, and Weibull models (Hannan, 1989). These models dif-
fer in that each implies a different functional relationship
between the hazard rate and the hypothesized covariates. At the
same time, event history analysis allows researchers to model
movements among multiple states, moving beyond the cur-
rent dichotomous classiﬁcation to consider multiple performance
positions (e.g., superior, ‘normal’ and below average).

Reputation and Persistent Proﬁtability

modeling the persistence of superior proﬁtability.
This approach requires that ﬁnancial performance
be recast as a categorical (i.e., superior vs. below-
average) variable. Moreover, it assumes that ﬁrms
are concerned with increasing the length of time
in superior performance positions.3 One
spent
potential concern with the event history approach
relates to the loss of
information that comes
from converting a continuous relative performance
measure to a categorical one. However,
the
superior vs. below-average dichotomy is well
established within the strategy ﬁeld. Superior ﬁrm
performance has traditionally been linked to the
advantages possessed by a ﬁrm relative to its
competitors (Porter, 1985). Current frameworks
retain this basic orientation by hypothesizing a link
between sustained superior ﬁnancial performance
and sustainable competitive advantages (Amit and
Schoemaker, 1993; Peteraf, 1993). Because the
independent construct—sustainable competitive
advantage—is
the measure of ﬁrm
ﬁnancial performance should be relative as well.4
With this
this concern may also
be addressed empirically—in the proportional
hazards regression models that follow, we test
whether the results are sensitive to the inclusion
of a continuous relative performance variable.

REPUTATION AND FINANCIAL DATA

From 1984 to 1998, Fortune
reported on
America’s Most Admired Corporations. This
annual
reputation survey covers Fortune 1000
ﬁrms and is based on responses from company
executives and directors, as well as from ﬁnancial
(the Appendix provides a summary
analysts
of
the data collection procedure). The survey
determines each ﬁrm’s overall reputation score
from ratings on eight scales which are relevant

3 Note that this event history approach corresponds with the
original approach used by Mueller (1977) to test the persistent
proﬁtability hypothesis. Mueller (1977) ﬁrst divided a sample of
ﬁrms into categories depending on their initial observed proﬁt
rate. He then analyzed the probability that a ﬁrm in a given
performance category would remain in that state each subsequent
year. The event history approach retains this underlying concern
with the probability of moving between different performance
categories, but allows researchers to assess the effects of
hypothesized covariates on these speciﬁc probabilities.
4 Hunt and Morgan’s (1995: 6) resource advantage theory of
competition is based on the premise that a ﬁrm’s objective is
to achieve superior ﬁnancial performance, and not that of proﬁt
maximization.

and product quality. Because

environmental friendliness, ability to develop and
keep key people, ﬁnancial soundness, degree
of innovativeness, investment value, management
quality,
these
reputation data are matched with corresponding
Fortune 1000 data, we link each ﬁrm–year
observation with data on ﬁrm proﬁtability (after-
tax return on total assets—ROA), market-to-book
value (market value divided by total shareholder’s
equity) and ﬁrm size (total sales). The complete
data ﬁle contains 4444 ﬁrm–year observations.
However, the sample of ﬁrms changes from one
year to the next and data are not available for
all ﬁrms in all years. Given the requirements of
this analysis, only those ﬁrms that report at least
two consecutive years of data are included. This
reduces the number of observations to 3141 (see
Table 1).

Accounting measures of proﬁtability (e.g., ROA)
are absolute performance measures. However, Eq-
uations 1 and 1a assess the dynamic properties
of a normalized proﬁt time series, whereas the
event history requires that we distinguish supe-
rior from below-average performance outcomes. In
either case, empirical research into sustained supe-
rior proﬁtability must recognize that a given return
is considered superior only if it is normal to earn
a lower return. Researchers operationalize nor-
mal returns using average (Mueller, 1977, 1986)
or weighted average (Cubbin and Geroski, 1987)
returns. This said, we must distinguish between
economy-wide and industry average returns (Cub-
bin and Geroski, 1987; Mueller, 1986; Rumelt,

1991). In most persistent proﬁtability studies, the
indicators of normal returns are economy-wide
measures. However, current strategy theory str-
esses that superior performance is derived from
advantages possessed by a ﬁrm relative to its com-
petitors. It is therefore desirable to equate normal
returns with the average returns accruing to all
ﬁrms within an industry, as this is more likely to
capture the ﬁrm’s relevant cadre of competitors.
This analysis uses industry average ROA as its
indicator of normal returns.

In previous analyses of the Fortune reputation
data, researchers found the eight reputation scales
to be highly correlated (Brown and Perry, 1994;
Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). In the complete data
ﬁle, the lowest pair-wise correlation among the
eight scales is between the degree of innovative-
ness and community and environmental friendli-
ness (ρ = 0.66), while the highest are between
management quality and both investment value
and management quality (ρ = 0.95). When fac-
tor analyzed, they produce a single dominant fac-
tor showing high loadings on all scales. There is
also a high degree of agreement between respon-
dents who were company executives, and those
who were ﬁnancial analysts (ρ = 0.82). This sug-
gests that Fortune’s reputation measure is a global
ﬁrm attribute that allows stakeholders to ﬁll in the
blanks when full information about ﬁrm particu-
lars is not readily available. Each overall reputation
score from the Fortune survey is compared with
the corresponding industry average to generate a
relative reputation variable. Table 2 indicates that
these scores range from −3.55 to 2.80.
If a ﬁrm’s reputation is derived in part from
its previous ﬁnancial performance, there may be
different interpretations of a positive relationship
between reputation and persistent proﬁtability. One
was raised above: under conditions of uncertainty,
good ﬁnancial performance contributes to a good
reputation, which in turn allows above-average
proﬁtability to persist over time. Alternatively, it
could be a manifestation of a measurement bias
(Brown and Perry, 1994; Capraro and Srivastava,
1997). Under this latter interpretation, respondents
in reputation surveys are simply tracking previ-
ous ﬁnancial performance and are therefore not
reporting ‘true’ reputation scores. To distinguish
the two possible reputation effects, we decom-
pose each reputation score into that which is pre-
dicted by previous proﬁtability, and that which
is independent of the ﬁrm’s history of ﬁnancial

performance (see Figure 1). Relative reputation is
regressed on increasingly higher-order lags of rel-
ative ROA until no further signiﬁcant improve-
ment in the regression R2 is observed. Table 3
shows that a ﬁrm’s relative reputation is posi-
tively inﬂuenced by its relative ROA in each of
the 4 preceding years, and that roughly 15 percent
of the variance in relative reputation is explained
by prior ﬁnancial performance. The models that
decompose the overall reputation effect use two
variables generated from the regression in Table 3:
the ﬁnancial reputation variable takes the pre-
dicted values from that regression, while resid-
ual reputation is comprised of its residuals. Note
that use of the additional lagged values of ROA

variables reduces the sample size to 1849 obser-
vations. Table 1 compares the overall and reduced
samples.

Table 4 reports descriptive statistics for the vari-
ables used in this study (for the complete and
the reduced samples), as well as the correlations
among them. Of particular interest are the con-
temporaneous correlations between relative ROA
and relative reputation, which attest to the cross-
sectional relationship between reputation and prof-
itability. Finally, the correlations between the rela-
tive reputation and market-to-book value variables
are quite low. Although market-to-book value may
capture certain elements of a ﬁrm’s intangible asset

base (Hall, 1993), it does not seem to capture its
reputation as measured in this study.5 These low

correlations also mitigate against concerns that the
reputation variable is arbitrarily picking up the
ﬁnancial market’s expectations about future eco-
nomic performance.

RESULTS

A key proposition in this analysis is that reputa-
tion differences are fairly stable over time. The
multiple entries in Table 2 by the same ﬁrms in
both the top 15 (e.g., Coca-Cola from 1994 to
1997; Wal-Mart from 1990 to 1992) and bottom 15
(e.g., Wang Labs and Continental Air from 1989
to 1999) of the distribution attest to the stabil-
ity inherent in the relative reputation scores over
time. This point is further evidenced in Table 5,
which estimates a baseline autoregressive model
using the relative reputation data. In the overall
sample, the persistence parameter is 0.89. Because
an estimate of one indicates that relatively high

5 According to Hall (1993), a ﬁrm’s full stock of intangibles
includes its intellectual property, trade secrets, contracts and
licenses, databases, information in the public domain, networks
and know-how, as well as its corporate culture and product and
corporate reputations. The fact that the relative MTB variable
is uncorrelated with the relative reputation score suggests that

the stock market’s assessment of a ﬁrm’s intangible resources
may overlook its reputation in favor of the other eight elements.
The low correlation might also reﬂect the fact that our variables
are measured relative to the corresponding industry averages,
whereas Hall’s (1993) demonstration presents only the raw
ﬁgures.

and low reputation scores persist indeﬁnitely, this
estimate indicates a very high degree of reputation
persistence over time. Similar parameter estimates
are obtained from the reduced sample using the
ﬁnancial reputation scores (0.92), and the residual
reputation scores (0.86).

Results from autoregressive proﬁt models

Models were estimated using four different sam-
ples: the overall sample (Models 1 and 2), the
reduced sample (Models 1a, 2a, and 3), a sample
comprised of observations in the reduced sam-
ple for which roait−1 is greater than zero (Model
4), and another using those observations in the
reduced sample for which roait−1 is less than, or
equal to zero (Model 5).6 The results are found in
Table 6. Model 1 estimates Equation 1 using the
overall sample. Here, the constant term (α0) is not
signiﬁcantly different from zero, while β0 (the per-
sistence parameter) is signiﬁcantly less than one.
These results are consistent with the ﬁndings of
previous persistent proﬁtability research, and sug-
gest that abnormal proﬁts do eventually converge
upon more normal long-run levels. Model 2 esti-
mates Equation 1a by incorporating the explana-
tory variables and their respective interactions with
the roait−1 variable. The signiﬁcant coefﬁcients on
the two reputation variables suggest that a good
reputation is associated with a greater persistence
parameter (β1 > 0) and a larger intercept
term
(α1 > 0). These ﬁndings support our reputation

6 In each of the following autoregressive proﬁts models, tests for
the presence of ﬁrst-order autocorrelation using Durbin’s M test
(Kmenta, 1986: 333) indicated no such problem.

hypothesis: ﬁrms with better reputations demon-
strate greater proﬁt persistence. The rate at which
their abnormal returns converge on long run lev-
els is slower, and that long-run rate of return is
itself larger. With respect to the controls, relative
market-to-book value has a positive and signiﬁcant
impact on the intercept term. This suggests that a
ﬁrm’s remaining stock of intangible assets is also
associated with the persistence of abnormal proﬁt
outcomes. Contrary to expectations, relative size
has no signiﬁcant effect on the intercept term, and
a negative impact on the persistence parameter.
To determine whether these results are sensitive
to the exclusion of the lagged observations in the
reduced sample, we reran Models 1 and 2 using
the reduced sample (see Models 1a and 2a). The
sign and signiﬁcance of the α1 and β1 parameter
estimates are unchanged.

Model 3 replaces the reputation variable with
its two (orthogonal) components: ﬁnancial and
residual reputation. An F -test suggests that the
explanatory power of the model is improved when
the reputation variable is decomposed (F = 12.92;
p = 0.00). The speciﬁc coefﬁcients suggest that
each component of reputation has a positive and
signiﬁcant effect on both the persistence parameter
(β1a and β1b > 0) and the intercept term (α1a and
α1b > 0). Although the impact of ﬁnancial reputa-
tion is found to be more pronounced, the nonﬁ-
nancial component of reputation also signiﬁcantly
improves proﬁt persistence.

Model 4 shows how the results change when
we focus on the persistence of superior proﬁts.
Once again, an F -test rejects the hypothesis of
identical coefﬁcients across the ﬁnancial and resid-
ual reputation effects (F = 4.72; p = 0.01). The
results suggest that ﬁrms with better reputations
(both ﬁnancial and residual) have greater persis-
tence parameters (β1a and β1b > 0). This again sup-
ports the reputation hypothesis. However, ﬁnan-
cial reputation has an insigniﬁcant impact on the
model’s intercept term, while the residual repu-
tation variable has a negative impact (α1b < 0).
This suggests that the effect of a good reputation is
found in the slower convergence of transitory supe-
rior proﬁt outcomes, and not in higher long-run
proﬁt levels. Figure 2 makes this point by com-
paring the paths of proﬁt convergence across three
(hypothetical) superior-performing ﬁrms, one with
average residual and ﬁnancial reputations, the sec-
ond with an above average residual reputation, and
the third with above average residual and ﬁnancial

mates from Model 4, we see that a relative ROA
of 10.0 in year one (which is one standard devia-
tion above the mean in the superior performance
sample) erodes more slowly if the ﬁrm in ques-
tion has the better residual reputation. That ﬁrm
demonstrates greater proﬁt persistence for the ﬁrst
6 years. If the ﬁrm also has an above average
ﬁnancial reputation, its superior proﬁt outcomes
demonstrate a much slower rate of convergence. It
is still outperforming the average reputation ﬁrm
in year eight.

The ﬁnal column of Table 6 shows the corre-
sponding results for those observations for which
roait−1 is less than zero, and provides information
about the persistence of below-average returns. In
Model 5, the intercept term is signiﬁcantly less
than zero, while the baseline persistence param-
eter is considerably lower than in the superior
proﬁts model.7 These results suggest that below-

and residual reputations do exert different effects
on proﬁt persistence (F = 3.91; p = 0.02),
the
model shows that a good reputation increases the
model’s intercept term (α1a and α1b > 0), but has
no signiﬁcant impact on the persistence parame-
ter (note that in the case of below-average per-
formance, a smaller persistence parameter would
be preferred). The lower panel of Figure 2 shows
the time path differences across the three (hypo-
thetical) below-average performing ﬁrms. Here,
an initial relative ROA of −8.81 (one standard
deviation below the mean in the below average
sample) erodes quickly to roughly −1.5 for the
is
average reputation ﬁrm. This long run level
higher (roughly −0.74) for the ﬁrm with a bet-
ter residual reputation, and higher still (roughly
0.05) for the ﬁrm that also has a better ﬁnan-
cial reputation.

Results from proportional hazards regression
models

We now use proportional hazards regression to
estimate the effects of relative reputation on the
probability of exiting either a superior, or a below-
average performance position. Models 6 and 7
focus on superior performance sustainability. In
the ﬁrst column of Table 7, the coefﬁcient on rep-
utation is negative and signiﬁcant, suggesting that
ﬁrms with better reputations are less likely to exit
a superior performance position at any point in

time. This again supports the reputation hypothe-
ses. Model 7 shows that the reputation ﬁndings
hold irrespective of whether one looks at ﬁnancial
or residual reputation. As noted, one concern about
using event history analysis is that the probability
of exiting a superior performance position should
be inversely related to the absolute size of the devi-
ation from normal. Consistent with this belief, the
estimated coefﬁcients on roait−1 are negative and
signiﬁcant. However, independent of the size of
the deviation from average, superior performance
positions are still protected in a dynamic sense
by relatively good reputations. The coefﬁcients on
the relative market-to-book value variable suggest
that a ﬁrm’s remaining stock of intangible assets
is not related to its ability to sustain superior proﬁt
outcomes over time. Similarly, the coefﬁcients on
relative size in both models are insigniﬁcant.

Deeper analysis of

the relative reputation
coefﬁcients in Model 7 indicates the practical
signiﬁcance of the results. Within the superior
performance subsample, a movement
in the
ﬁnancial
reputation score from one standard
deviation below the mean to one standard deviation
above corresponds to an increase from −0.14 to
0.56. Following Morita, Lee, and Mowday (1993),
we compute the relative likelihood of exiting a
superior performance position across these two
values of
reputation distribution.
Holding the values of the remaining variables
constant, the estimated likelihood of the higher

reputation ﬁrm exiting a superior performance
position is exp[(−0.98) * (0.56 + 0.14)], or 0.51
times that for the lower reputation ﬁrm. The same
calculation for the residual reputation variable
shows that the likelihood of the higher reputation
ﬁrm exiting a superior performance position is 0.70
times that for the lower reputation ﬁrm.

An additional insight provided by the event his-
tory approach derives from its ability to analyze
the factors affecting the establishment of superior
proﬁt positions. Models 8 and 9 demonstrate that
ﬁrms with relatively good reputations are signiﬁ-
cantly more likely to exit a below-average perfor-
mance position at any point in time. This suggests
that they tend to spend less time earning relatively
low returns. Once again, this result holds for both
the ﬁnancial and residual components of reputa-
tion. Repeating the above demonstration, we see
that (again holding the values of the other variables
constant), the estimated likelihood of the higher
ﬁnancial reputation ﬁrm exiting a below-average
performance position is 1.52 times that for the
lower reputation ﬁrm. The same calculation for the
residual reputation variable shows that the likeli-
hood of the higher reputation ﬁrm exiting is 1.59
times that for the lower reputation ﬁrm.

The results from Tables 6 and 7 consistently
support our reputation hypothesis. Firms with bet-
ter corporate reputations are better able to sus-
tain superior ﬁnancial performance outcomes over
time. Moreover, good reputations also help poor
performing ﬁrms in their efforts to return to prof-
itability. We close this section with a brief dis-
cussion of several analyses employed to determine
whether the observed ﬁndings generalize across
different industry contexts. In some industries, the
average reputation level is higher than in others.
For example, ﬁrms in the advertising/marketing
industry and pharmaceuticals industry typically
receive much higher reputation ratings than do
ﬁrms in the savings bank and toys/sporting goods
industry. At the same time, the intraindustry vari-
ance in reputation scores also varies across indus-
tries. To ascertain whether these industry charac-
teristics have a systematic impact on the results
reported, we reestimated Models 6 and 7 split-
ting the overall sample ﬁrst at the median of the
average industry reputation distribution, and then
at the median of the industry standard deviation
of reputation distribution. For all four subsamples,
the coefﬁcients on overall reputation fell within

Reputation and Persistent Proﬁtability
the −0.31 to −0.42 range and were highly sig-
niﬁcant. The parameter estimates for the ﬁnancial
reputation component fell consistently within the
−0.87 to −1.06 range and were also highly sig-
niﬁcant across the board. Finally, the coefﬁcients
on the residual reputation component were consis-
tently negative (all in the −0.13 to −0.37 range),
although not signiﬁcant at conventional levels in
the low average-reputation and high reputation-
dispersion subsamples.

Finally, our decision to use the Fortune repu-
tation data raises a potential issue relating to the
level at which reputation is measured. The rep-
utation data provided by Fortune are taken at
the corporate level of analysis, and many of the
ﬁrm’s surveyed compete across a number of differ-
ent product or service markets. Moreover, a num-
ber of them actively promote a range of speciﬁc
market-level reputations—or brands. For exam-
ple, between 1990 and 1998, Philip Morris had
13 brands among Advertising Age’s annual sur-
veys of the Top 200 Brands, while General Motors
was associated with nine brands.8 These examples
raise two issues. First, ﬁrms may invest in multiple
brands to suit different product or service mar-
kets. Second, ﬁrms may (as in the case of Philip
Morris) choose not to promote their corporate iden-
tities. In either case, one could query the speciﬁc
mechanism by which ﬁrms derive beneﬁts from
their reputations. The response to the ﬁrst issue is
quite straightforward. When ﬁrms develop market-
speciﬁc brands, they derive a direct beneﬁt when
those brands are associated with a positive overall
reputation. In respect of the second issue (where
consumers may not know the identity of the cor-
porate parent), the effects of reputation are subtler.
It would be difﬁcult to argue that a reputation can
have an impact on the economic activity of the
parties with which it transacts if those parties are
not aware of the identity of the ﬁrm possessing
that reputation.

With this in mind, note that some of the hypoth-
esized beneﬁts of a good reputation are found on
the cost side, and may therefore exist indepen-
dent of the diverse identities established within
speciﬁc product markets. In this respect, Philip
Morris may feel the effects of its reputation even

though individuals do not associate it with its spe-
ciﬁc offerings—all that is required is an aware-
ness of Philip Morris in labor markets, distribu-
tion channels (e.g., retail chains), or the various
input markets in which it participates. At the same
time, recent research on organizational status sug-
gests that there may be selection forces at work
that ensure that while ﬁrms do promote multiple
brand identities, the quality signals that ﬂow from
each are mutually reinforcing—ﬁrms may have a
strong incentive to deal only with similarly reputed
product brands (Podolny and Phillips, 1996). In
this respect, the multiple brand identities would be
expected to exude similar quality signals.

Given potential concerns, we conducted follow-
on analyses to test whether the hypothesized rela-
tionship between reputation and sustained superior
ﬁnancial performance holds for those ﬁrms with
brand identities that do not correspond to the iden-
tity of the corporate parent. Using annual surveys
from Advertising Age (1990–98), we identiﬁed the
ﬁrms in the sample that also had brands listed in
the Top 200 Brands surveys. These ﬁrms account
for 699 of the observations in the reduced data
ﬁle. The average normalized reputation score for
ﬁrms that are also very active advertisers (0.29)
is greater than that for ﬁrms not in the Top 200
Brands surveys (−0.02). This observation is con-
sistent with those made above regarding the self-
reinforcing effect of a good reputation—ﬁrms
with good reputations have a greater incentive
to engage in activities (e.g., brand advertising)
that further reinforces their positive reputations.
Moreover, the vast majority of this mean differ-
ence is found in the residual reputation differences
(0.29, as compared to −0.01), and not the ﬁnan-
cial reputation differences (0.12, vs. 0.11). This
supports our assumption that the residual reputa-
tions are driven by factors (e.g., brand advertising)
that may be orthogonal to short-term proﬁtability.
Finally, we isolated those ﬁrms that actively pro-
mote brands whose identity does not correspond
to that of the corporate parent. This yields an even
smaller sample of 351 ﬁrm–year observations in
the reduced data ﬁle.

We use these smaller samples to reestimate the
superior performance proportional hazards regres-
sion models (Models 6 and 7). Based on the sample
of all superior performance ﬁrms with branded
products (N = 351), the effect of reputation on the
superior performance hazard rate is negative and
signiﬁcant (−0.34). In the potentially problematic
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

case, wherein superior-performing ﬁrms promote
brands whose identity does not correspond to the
corporate reputation (N = 179), the effect of rep-
utation is again negative (−0.38) and, despite the
small sample, signiﬁcant at the 0.10 level. These
ﬁndings suggest that the effects of reputation are
not erased when all external stakeholders cannot
easily access information about reputation quality.

that

Conﬁdence in these results is heightened by the
fact
they hold for two orthogonal compo-
nents of reputation. A ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial reputation
has a consistently strong impact on proﬁt persis-
tence. This suggests an important self-reinforcing
dynamic. Some of the things that ﬁrms do to
improve proﬁtability also enhance their reputa-
tions. This reputation enhancement, in turn, makes
it easier for ﬁrms to sustain superior performance
outcomes over time. Having said this, roughly 85
percent of the variance in the relative reputation
measure is not accounted for by prior proﬁt results.
And this residual reputation is also linked to proﬁt
persistence. Instead of working through ﬁnancial
performance demonstrations and the signals that
they generate, some ﬁrm actions have direct effects
on reputation with ﬂow-through effects on proﬁt
persistence.

Another interesting insight emerges from a com-
parison of the superior and below-average models
in Table 6. It seems that the dynamic impact of rel-
ative reputation is different across these two sub-
samples (see Figure 2). For superior performance
outcomes, the reputation variable exerts its posi-
tive effect on the persistence parameter, but not the
intercept term. This suggests that good reputations
lead to increased temporal stability in the short

Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 1077–1093 (2002)


term, but may induce some rigidity that harms
superior-performing ﬁrms in the longer term. This
is similar to the effect uncovered by Sorensen
(2002) in his analysis of the relationship between
strong corporate cultures and performance stabil-
ity. He demonstrates that strong cultures may facil-
itate adaptation when the amount of environmental
volatility is modest, but may constrain ﬁrms when
the need for major adaptations is greater. In our
context, superior-performing ﬁrms with good rep-
utations ﬁnd themselves with an advantage that is
durable in the short run, when those reputations
are maximally relevant. However, those same rep-
utations may become less relevant over time, and
may even hurt superior-performing ﬁrms in the
long run. Note also how this interpretation is not
inconsistent with the results from the proportional
hazard regression models. Model 7 shows that the
year-to-year stability of superior ﬁrm performance
is affected in the predicted direction by both ﬁnan-
cial and residual reputation. However, the model
is not able to address the longer-term effects that
were uncovered in the autoregressive models. For
below-average performance outcomes, the reputa-
tion effect is most dramatic vis-`a-vis the model’s
intercept term. Taken together, these observations
suggest that reputation works in different ways,
depending on the initial performance position of
the ﬁrm. This difference in the speciﬁc manifesta-
tions of ﬁrm reputation across the two performance
samples is certainly worthy of further exploration.
The inclusion of the relative size variable was
intended to control for unobserved size-related
effects on proﬁt persistence. However, we are sur-
prised by the results that were obtained. While the
predominant belief with respect to sustainability is
that (if anything) bigger is better, this supposition
is not conﬁrmed by this research. Taken together,
the size and reputation ﬁndings are consistent with
arguments put forth by Dierickx and Cool (1989).
Reputation is cited as an example of a strategic
asset precisely because the development of a good
reputation takes considerable time, and depends on
a ﬁrm making stable and consistent investments
over time. On the other hand, it is easy to see
how larger size may be achieved virtually instan-
taneously. In this respect, ﬁrm size is not subject
to time compression diseconomies. This difference
between the two variables may explain why good
reputation enhances the sustainability of a supe-
rior performance outcome, while size does not

that contributes

We have demonstrated empirically that

a
corporate reputation is an important strategic
asset
to ﬁrm-level persistent
proﬁtability. However, there is still much to be
done. In respect of reputation, this research has
raised a number of important follow-on questions,
such as the need to understand and explain the
asymmetric time paths of high- and low-reputation
ﬁrms. Our ﬁnal recommendation relates to the
overall orientation of the individuals providing
the evaluations in the Fortune reputation surveys.
The reputation data come from ﬁrm managers
and directors, as well as from market analysts.
These are important stakeholder groups, whose
assessments are important
in an analysis that
focuses on the ﬁnancial performance of ﬁrms
within competitive markets (Zuckerman, 1999).
However, there are other groups of stakeholders
(e.g., customers, employees, and suppliers) whose
evaluations of the ﬁrm are also likely to have
implications for ﬁnancial performance dynamics.
As such, future iterations of this research should
examine the relationship between the reputations
of these other stakeholder groups and the ﬁrm’s
ﬁnancial performance dynamics.

APPENDIX: METHODOLOGY
EMPLOYED FOR COLLECTING
REPUTATION DATA

The companies in the America’s Most Admired
Corporations survey consist of the four to eleven
largest companies in each of the industries from
the Fortune 1000 lists for the year prior to the
year of the reputation survey. The companies so
surveyed, in turn, were based on the ﬁnancial data
rankings published in the previous year’s Fortune
500 magazine issue (which actually covers 1000
companies as service companies are also included).
Fortune 1000 companies are assigned to an indus-
try based upon the activity that contributed most
to their revenues.

The respondent

sample consists of

senior
executives and outside directors of Fortune 1000
companies and ﬁnancial analysts who cover those
companies. In particular, the following process was
used:

Also, questionnaires were sent to as many as
seven outside directors in each of these top
10 companies.

(2) Among companies that ranked 11 through 25
in their industry on the Fortune 500 lists, ques-
tionnaires were sent to the top ﬁve executives
beginning with the Chairman and CEO.

(3) Financial analysts, both buy-side and sell-
side, who covered each of the industries were
sent questionnaires. The deﬁnition of ‘cover-
age’ was determined according to whether the
analysts covered either this ‘industry’ or this
grouping of companies.

Approximately 12,000 senior executives, direc-
tors, and ﬁnancial analysts were surveyed in 1998.
Throughout
this survey has experi-
enced a response rate approaching 50 percent.
For each year, questionnaires were mailed early
in the fall. This initial mailing was followed up
by two subsequent mailings as well as phone
calls and faxes to many of the respondents. The
survey was organized so that each respondent
received a questionnaire with the same struc-
ture; however,
the actual companies that were
asked about were tailored to that respondent’s
own industry.

industry, 10 top executives, beginning with the
