The Relative Importance of Interﬁrm Relationships and Knowledge
Transfer for New Product Development Success

Mette Praest Knudsen

The relationship and network literature has primarily focused on particular partner
types, for example, buyer–supplier relationships or competitor interaction. This
article explores the nature and relative importance of different types of interﬁrm
relationships for new product development (NPD) success. The underlying premise
of the study is that not only the type of interﬁrm relationships but also the com-
bination of relationships are important for NPD performance. The interaction with
a specific type of partner is expected to inﬂuence innovative performance by means
of appropriate knowledge transfer. Varying needs for external knowledge, and thus
types of relationships, are observed depending on the particular stages in the NPD
process, the character of the knowledge base of the ﬁrm, and the industrial con-
ditions. The absorption of external knowledge is discussed using the degree of re-
dundancy in knowledge, which is deﬁned as the degree of overlap in the knowledge
base of the sender and the recipient of knowledge. Hence, the degree of redundancy
has direct implications for the ease and, hence, use of knowledge shared with an
external partner. The article is based on data from the Know for Innovation survey
on innovative activities among European ﬁrms, which was carried out in 2000 in
seven European countries covering ﬁve industries. The article explores the extent of
use of external relationships in collaborative product development and ﬁnds that
customers are involved more frequently in joint development efforts. Second, the
industry association of the most important relationship is studied, and the results
show that ﬁrms tend to partner with ﬁrms from their own industry. The danger in
this approach is that ﬁrms from their own industry tend to contribute similar
knowledge, which ultimately may endanger the creation of new knowledge and
therefore more radical product developments. The analyses combine the ﬁnding that
relationships with customers are used most frequently at both early and late stages
of the product development process, with a second and more contradictory ﬁnding
that at the same time customer relationships have a negative impact on innovative
success. Moreover, the combination of customers, with both universities and com-
petitors, has a significant negative effect on innovative performance. The potential
causes of this apparent paradox can be narrowed down to two: (1) the average
customer may be unable to articulate needs for advanced technology-based prod-
ucts; and (2) the average customer may be unable to conceptualize ideas beyond the

realm of his or her own experience. Based on this evidence the article cautions
product development managers to think explicitly about what certain customers can
contribute with and, more importantly, to match this contribution directly with their
own sense of what direction product development should go in the future. Finally,
the role of complementary as well as supplementary knowledge is investigated for
innovative success ﬁnding that sharing of supplementary knowledge with external
partners in NPD leads to a positive effect on innovative performance. The article is
concluded by a discussion of the implication of this ﬁnding for building knowledge
within the ﬁrm and for selecting external partners for NPD.

Setting the Scene

T he present article investigates how different

types of interorganizational relationships and
knowledge contribute to create new product
development (NPD) success and explores both of the
relationships ﬁrms are using and the type of knowl-
edge exchanged to achieve innovative performance.
The underlying premise of the study is that not only
the type of interﬁrm relationships but also the com-
bination of relationships are important for NPD per-
formance. Moreover, the degree of redundancy in
knowledge has important implications for the ease
and, hence, use of knowledge shared with an external
partner. The interaction with a specific type of partner
is expected to inﬂuence innovative performance by
means of appropriate knowledge transfer. Varying
needs for external knowledge, and thus types of rela-
tionships, are observed depending on the particular
stages in the NPD process, the character of the knowl-
edge base of the ﬁrm, and the industrial conditions.

The research questions guiding the article are as

follows:

R1: Which types of relationships are used most
frequently for new product development?

R2: From which industries do ﬁrms choose their
partners?

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

Dr. Mette Praest Knudsen is associate professor of international
market strategy in the Department of Marketing and Management
at the University of Southern Denmark. Her research is on new
product development, in particular focusing on the use of external
sources of knowledge to achieve competitive advantages and there-
by emphasizing the role of industrial relationships for product de-
velopment. Her research has been published in journals including
Industrial and Corporate Change and Journal of High Technology
Management Research.

R3: Which single relationships and combinations of
types of relationships contribute positively to innovative
performance?

R4: Is supplementary knowledge or complementary
knowledge the more fruitful for innovative performance?

The motivation for these research questions is to
advance a more general perspective on portfolios of
interorganizational relationships in NPD as opposed
to previous specific orientations toward particular
partner types like, for example, buyer–supplier rela-
tionships (Croom, 2001; Gadde and Ha˚ kansson, 1994;
Gadde and Snehota, 2000; Jap, 2001) or competitor
interactions (Dussauge, Garrette, and Mitchell, 2000;
Sarkar et al., 2001). The portfolios of relationships are
investigated as types of interorganizational relation-
ships and their importance for NPD performance. The
potential partner types are customers, competitors,
suppliers, universities and public and private research
institutes (PRIs), and consultants. For this reason, the
present article does not investigate all relationships
ﬁrms use but presents these as combinations of differ-
ent types of relationships. For example, a ﬁrm may use
several customers, one supplier, and one competitor,
which are summarized in a portfolio of customer,
supplier, and competitor relationships.

Furthermore, previous literature has focused inten-
sively on the problems for the ﬁrm transferring tacit
knowledge both internally and externally (see, e.g.,
Ancori, Bureth, and Cohendet, 2000; Cohendet and
Steinmueller, 2000; Osterloh and Frey, 2000). The
problems with the tacit–codiﬁed distinction with re-
spect to the present article relate to both the one-sided
focus on tacitness and the problems of pursuing this
theoretical dichotomy in empirical studies.

As an alternative, it is suggested that knowledge
may viewed along two dimensions: namely, the degree
of supplementarity and the degree of complementar-
ity. The degree of overlap in knowledge between

two partners—that is, redundancy—is described in
Rindﬂeisch and Moorman (2001, p. 3) as ‘‘the degree
of similarity in the new product-related information,
capabilities and skills among new product alliance
participants.’’ Focusing on the degree of similarity in
the knowledge base of the ﬁrm compared to a par-
ticular alliance partner allows us to search for a deep-
er understanding of supplementary knowledge—that
is, high degree of similarity—and complementary
knowledge. This approach seems more promising
for two reasons. First, the knowledge exchanged for
NPD is not one thing but a set of experiences and
possibly documents, which may both be tacit and co-
diﬁed in nature. And the problems with establishing
an acceptable definition of knowledge is exactly be-
cause of the nature of knowledge (see, e.g., Hunt,
2003; King and Zeithaml, 2003; Tsoukas and Vlad-
imirou, 2001). But with the distinction between sup-
plementary and complementary knowledge,
the
knowledge received by the ﬁrm is gained by explor-
ing the extent of similarity between the knowledge
bases of the ﬁrm and its partner. Second, because of
the attempt to gain the knowledge shared among the
partners, the respondent is only requested to make
one overall assessment that provides a more general
picture but probably is also a more precise estimate.
In the empirical analysis, the problems and oppor-
tunities in knowledge ﬂows from external partners are
carried directly to the knowledge base of the ﬁrm,
characterizing the knowledge as either supplementary
or complementary. The former refers to reception of
knowledge that matches the ﬁrm’s ﬁeld of expertise and
is equal to a higher degree of redundancy between the
ﬁrm and its partner. The latter refers to knowledge that
when received is perceived as being outside the ﬁrm’s
existing ﬁeld of expertise, leading to a lower degree
of redundancy. Finally, innovative performance refers
to the share a particular innovation contributes to total
turnover. Thus, differences in innovative performance
are expected to be an effect of different types of
relationships and knowledge ﬂows.

The article is organized in the following way. First,
an introduction to relationships and knowledge ﬂows
is provided, as well as a description of the importance
of these for NPD. Based on the descriptions, hypoth-
eses on knowledge ﬂows, types of relationships, and
innovative performance are outlined. The empirical
sections are preceded with a description of the data
source and the variables. The two empirical sections
analyze the research questions separately: The descrip-
tive section addresses the ﬁrst question regarding the

frequency of relationship utilization. The second
empirical section presents the results of a regression
analysis to the importance of interﬁrm relationships
and knowledge transfer for innovative performance
covering both research questions 2 and 3. Finally, the
results are discussed in a concluding section, followed
by a description of the implications for management
and future research.

Interﬁrm Relationships and Knowledge
Transfer

The recent upsurge of
industrial network and
relationship theories carry important questions like,
‘‘Why do ﬁrms engage in interorganizational cooper-
ation and when? With whom are ﬁrms likely to ally
and why? How do ﬁrms organize and control their
cooperation? What is exchanged between the partners
and how does it matter?’’
(Ebers, 1999, p. 32).
Particularly the form,
the content, and intensity
of interaction have been analyzed where the latter is
closely related to the strength of ties perspective (For
a theoretical account see, e.g., Granovetter, 1973;
Mathews et al., 1998; for empirical testing see, e.g.,
Hansen, 1999; McEvily and Zaheer, 1999). The
present article aims at contributing to the second
question by asking, With whom ﬁrms are likely to
ally, and, adding, what is the effect on innovative
performance? To the fourth question also is asked,
What is exchanged and how does it matter?

Why should ﬁrms engage in collaborations on new
product development? The motives for engaging in
interﬁrm relationships may be summarized under the
headings of external challenges or internal needs
(Child and Faulkner, 1998). One particular need,
which is most often stressed, is the need for renewing
the knowledge base through knowledge creation and
learning (Child and Faulkner, 1998; Sakakibara,
2001; Wognum, Fischer, and Weenink, 2002). These
challenges and needs may coincide, and therefore two
possible answers may be given to the preceding ques-
tion. First, the ﬁrm must protect its knowledge base
from inappropriate knowledge imitation by a partner,
for which reason any collaboration may knowingly
try to minimize the loss of property rights. Second, the
process of developing new products is long, cumber-
some, and potentially erroneous, hence the use of an
external partner that may save money and time by
splitting the research and development (R&D) cost
and time from shortening the development phase but

may also open up for developing unexplored, poten-
tial developments. Thus, the decision to engage in
interorganizational relationships should balance the
advantages of accessing new knowledge, new oppor-
tunities, and sharing of risk and cost against the po-
tential problems of loosing knowledge involuntarily.
The involvement of external partners in NPD is a
prototypical example (Sobrero and Roberts, 2002)
leading to maintained or increased competitiveness,
because of the frequent and rapid changes in resources
and products (Chakravarthy, 1997; Hitt, Ireland, and
Lee, 2000).

The theoretical understanding is therefore that to
enable the invention of new products the NPD proc-
ess requires creation and utilization of knowledge.
New knowledge enables both learning and creativity
leading to reproduction of the existing knowledge
base. As stressed already, new knowledge may be ac-
cessed through external sources like interorganiza-
tional collaborations, but different sources supply
different knowledge bits, so it is therefore evident
that all types of relationships and their separate con-
tributions to NPD performance must be examined.

The Hypotheses

The accumulation of relational experience (Dyer and
Singh, 1998; Kale, Dyer, and Singh, 2002; Kale,
Singh, and Perlmutter, 2000; Sivadas and Dwyer,
2000; S
rensen and Reve, 1998) within interorganiza-
tional relationships is an important factor leading to
the achievement of successful knowledge ﬂows. Alli-
ance formation, partner choice, management, and the
exchange of knowledge are building blocks that assist
the ﬁrm in creating relational experience. These elem-
ents may all smooth future collaborative ventures
through an increased ability to resolve conﬂicts by
building team synergies and achieving goals. Sivadas
and Dwyer (2000) examined the direct effect of co-
operative competency and NPD performance and
found that both cooperative competency among de-
partmental units and among the alliance partners
were positively associated with NPD performance.
For this reason, collaboration on product or process
innovation in general—that is, also within other pro-
jects—is expected to contribute to product develop-
ment performance.

H1: Collaboration on product innovation has a positive
effect on innovative performance.

The success of interorganizational knowledge ﬂows
is expected to be associated with the particular type of
partner. For instance, universities and public and pri-
vate research institutes (PRIs) focus on fundamental
and basic research projects with extended duration of
the development projects that are less likely to lead to
immediate economic payoffs. However, the basic sci-
ence insights achieved through these relationships are
more likely to have significant positive effects on in-
novative performance in the long run. The ﬁrst reason
for assuming a slow payoff period is the nature of the
exchanged knowledge. Spencer (2001) stated that
there is little doubt that university research contrib-
utes substantially to the basic stock of scientific
knowledge. The appropriation of basic science for in-
dustrial innovative activities is, however, a long proc-
ess of conversion of knowledge to industrial purposes
that involves extensive investments, time, and risk
(Johnson and Johnston, 2004). Second, problems of
culture clashes, bureaucratic inﬂexibility, poorly de-
signed reward systems, and ineffective management of
technology transfer ofﬁces are just some of the barri-
ers that may hinder the transfer of knowledge to in-
dustrial ﬁrms (Siegel et al., 2003). Therefore, two
factors support the delay in appropriating knowledge
from universities and PRIs for innovative perform-
ance: (1) the scientific nature of knowledge; and (2)
the barriers to knowledge sharing between two differ-
ent organizational governance structures. The long-
term nature of utilization of scientific knowledge is a
particular characteristic in the case of universities and
PRIs. It is therefore hypothesized that knowledge
from universities and PRIs contribute positively to
innovative performance.

H2: Relationships with universities and PRIs have a
positive effect on innovative performance.

Customer involvement and NPD performance are
typically associated with positive interactions (Brock-
hoff, 2003; Salomo, Steinhoff, and Tromsdorff, 2003)
However, two opposite effects may therefore be asso-
ciated with customer involvement. First, customer in-
volvement should lead to more application-oriented
development projects with shorter time horizons, less
risk, and lower investments compared to, for example,
university involvement. The application orientation
may, however, be too focused on the needs of single
customer groups (Bonner and Walker, 2004), an effect
that may lead to negative innovative performance. Sec-
ond, and with the opposite effect, the involvement of

customers may lead to highly successful products if the
product characteristics satisfy the needs of a broad
range of customer groups. This second condition is ex-
pected to be prevalent especially in homogenous mar-
kets with limited variance in customer wants. However,
with the frequently cited high speed of technological
change combined with the increased competitive pres-
sure stemming from the globalization processes, the
markets are expected to experience increased variance
and heterogeneity in customer needs. Hence, collabor-
ation with customers in product development projects
is expected to be frequent, but with a negative effect on
overall innovative performance.

H3: Customer involvement has a negative effect on in-
novative performance.

Wynstra and Pierick (2000) directly relate supplier
involvement and innovative performance by arguing
that the extent of responsibility delegation to the sup-
plier and the development risk associated with the
project increase effectiveness and efﬁciency of product
development efforts. Supplier involvement early in the
development process combined with intense patterns
of communication ﬂows is viewed as driving forces for
faster releases of new products and responses to com-
petitor moves (Sobrero and Roberts, 2002). Suppliers
deliver insights into the integration of product devel-
opment and production by, for example, testing pro-
cedures of
the components integration into the
innovation and by developing prototypes. As a con-
sequence, supplier involvement may rest not only in
ideas based on the supplier’s own component features
and characteristics but also in ensuring that the com-
ponent is ﬁtted in the best possible manner to the in-
novation. However, supplier involvement may be
viewed as a preliminary step toward outsourcing of
the development efforts (Wognum, Fischer, Weenink,
2002), which may in itself be an argument for in-
creased supplier involvement already at early stages.
Therefore, suppliers may contribute positively to
product development performance by learning the
features of the replaced component, subsequently us-
ing the achieved knowledge as a generator for new
development projects.

H4: Supplier involvement has positive effect on innova-
tive performance.

Competitors may possess relevant supplementary
knowledge that can lead to immediate success, but

why should they be interested in joint develop-
ment efforts? If the ﬁrms are direct competitors,
many opportunities for learning may arise, which
may result in learning races for market shares that
result in major competitive consequences (Dussauge,
Garrette, and Mitchell, 2000). Sivadas and Dwyer
(2000) formulated the hypothesis that noncompetitor
alliances would foster higher cooperative competence
than competitor alliances, indicating that noncom-
petitors are more likely to foster collaboration and
that competitors are more likely to foster competition.
Perks and Easton (2000) supported this dilemma
and argued that the only defendable reason to inter-
act with competitors is to compete better against
third-party competitors. Based on this assumption,
the present article argues that knowledge ﬂows
between competitors,
insofar as they in fact take
place,
lead to positive effects on performance by
shortening the development periods and by providing
quick and easy access to knowledge. Joint research
and development (R&D) projects between competi-
tors are even less likely to take place because transfer
of knowledge such as for idea generation can turn
out to cannibalize one’s own efforts. An important
managerial challenge is therefore not to avoid allying
with competitors but to safeguard the knowledge
base from unintended appropriation and imitation.
Thus, collaboration with competitors is expected to be
infrequent but to have positive effects on innovative
performance.

H5: Competitor involvement has a positive effect on
innovative performance.

are

Finally, the role of consultants is less clear and has
only been researched to a very limited degree. Ama-
bile et al. (2001) examined the cross-profession col-
laborations within management and found that only
4% of the publications in the Academy of Manage-
ment Journal and less than 1% of articles in Admin-
istrative Science Quarterly
coauthored by
academics and consultants. For product development,
consultants can either provide technical knowledge
for tailored projects and act as an additional work
force or can act as an advisor to the ﬁrm on the prod-
uct development process in general. From this, a posi-
tive effect of consultant
involvement should be
expected on innovative performance, but such an
effect is dependent on the general labor availability
in the industry and is therefore more likely to be
significant in industries characterized by technical

bottlenecks. Thus, an explorative hypothesis on the
consultant involvement is advanced:

H6: Consultant involvement has a positive effect on
innovative performance.

An important motivation for establishing interor-
ganizational relationships is the transfer and receipt of
knowledge for learning purposes (Child and Faulkner,
1998; Sakakibara, 2001). Processes of knowledge trans-
fer as well as mediators and barriers to knowledge
ﬂows have attracted increasing interest in recent years.
A key factor in the discussion of knowledge transfer
is the characteristics of the knowledge to be trans-
ferred. The characteristics or dimensions of knowledge
have been described using multiple dichotomies where
the most prominent one without doubt is the distinc-
tion between tacit and codiﬁed knowledge (See, e.g.,
Ancori, Bureth, and Cohendet, 2000; Cohendet and
Steinmueller, 2000; Nonaka, 1994; Nonaka and Takeu-
chi, 1995; Zack, 1999 for in-depth discussions on the
problems of codiﬁcation and transfer of tacit knowl-
edge). Knowledge transfer of complex and tacit knowl-
edge requires as a minimum face-to-face interaction,
which is, however, problematic and costly (Rocha,
1999). Hence, tacitness is associated with multiple com-
plexities and therefore hinders technological knowl-
edge transfer. On the other hand, codiﬁed knowledge,
like prototypes, can more easily be transferred and
likely at lower cost. Finally, the distinction between
tacit and codiﬁed knowledge has often been viewed as
two extremes on an absolute scale. An alternative ap-
proach is to subsume the knowledge characteristic and
the ﬂow of knowledge in the relative overlap of the
knowledge bases of the partners. This distinction is
known as the supplementary–complementary knowl-
edge dichotomy.

Supplementary things are deﬁned as ‘‘things that
are added to something in order to improve it’’
(Cobuild, 1997, p. 1678). Supplementary knowledge
may therefore be deﬁned as high degrees of redun-
dancy in the form of similar product development
knowledge and skills (Rindﬂeisch and Moorman,
2001, p. 2). Since redundancy equals overlap in
knowledge as stated already, supplementary knowl-
edge is easier to transfer given prior knowledge and
mutual understanding between the receiving and the
transmitting ﬁrm. Therefore, supplementary knowl-
edge is easier to transfer because of the overlap in
knowledge by the receiving and the transmitting ﬁrm.
Exchange of supplementary knowledge allows the

partners to achieve scale economies and to reduce
excess capacity but is therefore also associated with
the dangers of double jeopardy through (1) the lack
of learning potential and (2) the threat of potential
competition caused by the decrease in knowledge gaps
between the partners.

Complementarity things are deﬁned as ‘‘things that
are different from each other but make a good com-
bination’’ (Cobuild, 1997, p. 327). Complementary
knowledge may therefore be deﬁned as low degrees of
redundancy in the form of dissimilar product devel-
opment knowledge and skills. Complementary knowl-
edge comprises a larger potential for learning through
the combination of different and complementary
skills and resources viewed as a lower overlap (Duss-
auge, Garrette, and Mitchell, 2000; Rothaermel, 2001;
Sarkar et al., 2001). Thus, supplementary knowledge
can be expected to provide quicker and more success-
ful product development in the short term, whereas
complementary knowledge may take longer to use
depending on the level of absorptive capacity but car-
ries a higher learning potential.

The expected success of knowledge transfer pro-
cesses depends on the needs in the innovation process.
Early on in the process, supplementary knowledge
may ﬁt better with the existing knowledge, especially
if customers are involved who requests well-known
changes to products. Complementary knowledge is
more likely to trigger new ideas that challenge existing
knowledge and understanding. Successful reception of
complementary knowledge may therefore lead to
learning, creation of new projects, and use of the
knowledge for different purposes. Hence, in the short
run complementary knowledge leads to longer devel-
opment times and higher costs and risks, which may
ultimately affect innovative performance negatively.
Consequently, complementary knowledge is more
likely to lead to radical product development efforts
but also to higher performance in the long term. Sup-
plementary and complementary knowledge both
therefore add to the quality of the existing knowl-
edge, whereas the latter serve different needs as the
form broadens the scope of the present invention and
provide valuable insights for other potentially unre-
lated projects.

H7: Supplementary knowledge has a positive effect on
innovative performance.

H8: Complementary knowledge has a positive effect on
innovative performance.

The NPD Process

So far, the effects of relationships and knowledge
ﬂows on innovative performance have been discussed.
To vary these perspectives, a stage model is applied to
the NPD process (Grupp, 1993; Rosenberg, 1982).
The underlying logic is to couple time with product
development phases. One of the early models was Jo-
seph Schumpeter’s distinction among invention, in-
novation, and diffusion of innovations. Later the so-
called pipeline models (Schmidt-Tiedeman, 1982)
were developed, which assume a simple sequence of
the phases (1) research, (2) development, (3) produc-
tion, and (4) marketing, with only limited overlap be-
tween the phases. The sequential models were
criticized for their simplistic view of product develop-
ment and were opposed to more processual models
that claimed the importance of feedback processes
and larger overlap between the phases to ensure prod-
uct development performance (Dosi, 1988). To sim-
plify the matter, although recognizing the processual
nature of NPD the NPD process is divided into the
stage of the original idea and the completion of the
innovation, which may be compared to the research
phase and the development phase in the aforemen-
tioned sequential model. Obviously, a more reﬁned
stage model—for example, Brockhoff (2003)—or a
process-based model would improve understanding of
partner involvement.

The question then emerges as to what types of re-
lationship can contribute with relevant knowledge at
what stages of NPD. The underlying premise is that
the type of knowledge a customer contributes may be
more important to generate new ideas rather than to
contribute to the ﬁnalization of the product. A dif-
ferent view is that a high degree of market orientation
would lead to the conclusion that customers should be
involved every step of the way (Brockhoff, 2003). The
external knowledge resources may therefore play dif-
ferent roles at different stages in the R&D process.
However, as the literature on these effects is limited,
the present study does not further subdivide the hy-
potheses but subsequently comments on the results.

The Data Set

The survey of European manufacturing and service
industries on innovation-related knowledge ﬂows
(Know) was carried out in the year 2000. The sample
covered seven European countries: Denmark, France,

Germany, Greece, Holland, Italy, and the United
Kingdom. It spanned ﬁve industrial sectors: food
and beverages, paint and varnishes, telecom equip-
ment, telecom services, and computer services—Clas-
siﬁcation of Economic Activities in the European
Community (NACE) codes 15, 24 (  24.4), 32, 64,
and 72, respectively. The size of ﬁrms in the sample
were between 10 and 999 employees. The survey was
concerned with both general innovation-related activ-
ity and the most important innovation of the ﬁrm de-
veloped within the preceding three years. The present
article is based on the interorganizational relation-
ships that were involved and used for the development
of the most important innovation.

Table 1 reveals great differences among the coun-
tries participating in the response rates; especially the
sampling data for the United Kingdom must be care-
fully interpreted. The sample is limited to innovators;
although some material was gathered on non-innova-
tors, these are not used in the present article. The data
set comprised 632 ﬁrms, some of which afterward
proved to be outside the targeted sectors and some of
which passed the size limits from the day of sampling
to actual response by more than 25% (i.e., inclusion
of ﬁrms up to 1,250 employees was allowed). The re-
spondent addressed was the R&D manager of the
ﬁrm, but in some cases the ﬁrm was active in two
product lines (e.g., telecom equipment based on op-
tical networks and photocopiers). These are divided
into two different NACE sectors at the two-digit lev-
els. If separate R&D managers existed for each of
these two product lines, the study asked for the R&D
manager of telecom equipment because this product
line is included in the list of industries examined. In
case a ﬁrm was active in more than two product lines
and there were separate R&D managers for each of

these product lines, the R&D manager responsible for
the ﬁrm’s main product line was requested.

In total, the data set contains 557 ﬁrms. Due to the
particularities of NPD, sector differences might also
be considered of importance. Table 2 highlights the
distribution by country and sector of the sample. Here
it can be seen that particular telecom services are
underrepresented compared to the other sectors.

The relationship types are competitors, suppliers,
customers, universities or PRIs (which does not include
the employment of graduate students for the purpose
of, e.g., writing master’s theses, although this is
considered an important source of knowledge), and
consultants. These are identiﬁed by asking the respon-
dents with whom they collaborated during two differ-
ent stages in the product development process, namely,
at the stage of the original idea and at the completion
of the innovation stage. In deﬁning the idea stage,
the respondent was instructed that ideas are general
concepts of what might be technically or economically
feasible and that by completion of the innovation they
should consider the time period during which the
innovation was developed until ﬁnalization.

For each stage, the respondent was asked to mark
the types that were actively involved in NPD. These
variables are therefore dichotomous (i.e., yes or no).
All or none of these could be chosen. It should be
noted the ﬁrm may have had several different ﬁrms as
partners that would all qualify as, for example, cus-
tomers, but they would only be marked once. This
means that densities and frequencies of interaction
cannot be established but merely allow for statements
about the prevalence of relationships. If a process
model should have been applied as it was argued the-
oretically, then it would imply that the respondent

should respond to a series of questions about the re-
lationships at each stage and for each type of rela-
tionship. Surely that would have led to serious data
problems as the respondent would not repeat the same
questions too many times. The advantage of the se-
lected stages is that they are at two different places in
the process, which enables the respondent to clearly
distinguish them and to raise the reliability and the
validity of the data accordingly.

The knowledge characteristics—supplementary and
complementary—were assessed for
the knowledge
received in developing the most important innovation,
but it is unknown whether this knowledge was received
from the most important partner. The options to mark
were whether they received knowledge in areas where
they had expertise already or in areas where they lacked
expertise (i.e., yes or no). A high degree of supplemen-
tary knowledge was deﬁned as high degrees of redun-
dancy in the form of similar product development
knowledge and skills. The choice was therefore to
operationalize supplementary knowledge as knowledge
areas where they already had expertise underlining the
overlap in product development knowledge. Similarly,
complementary knowledge was deﬁned as low degrees
of knowledge, and therefore it is argued that comple-
mentary knowledge is associated with areas where the
ﬁrm is lacking expertise.

The dependent variable, innovative performance,
was measured in percent as the share of turnover
coming from the most important innovation of total
turnover in the last completed year of accounting.
The criteria for the identiﬁcation of the most impor-
tant innovation was the economically most important,
which could be the innovation with the highest real-
ized or expected profit or turnover. The dependent

variable had a missing value rate of 41%, which
appears to be quite high. A t-test of the split sam-
ple—the ﬁrst group contained all cases with the ques-
tion missing, and the second group contained all cases
that had in fact answered the question—was conduct-
ed on key variables, and only in the case of ﬁrm size
the relationship could not be rejected at 95% signif-
icance level. This means that for all other variables,
the use of the dependent variable is statistically un-
problematic, and, thus, the variable is accepted as the
dependent variable. There are several problems asso-
ciated with this measure, and obviously other meas-
ures of innovative performance can be suggested—for
example, number of innovations coming from prod-
uct development or time to market. First, the innova-
tive performance measure relates to sales within the
last year of accounting, but it is well known from the
literature that relationships are costly and time con-
suming to build and are very resource intensive to
maintain and manage. Therefore, the measure may
not be closely related to the types of relationship as
these may refer to a longer time horizon than the per-
formance measure can account
the
breakthrough period of innovations to full accept-
ance on the market may be longer than three years,
leading again to lower shares of turnover that may
affect the levels of significance negatively. The de-
pendent variable—pertaining to what percentage of
the ﬁrm’s total sales in the previous accounting year
could be attributed to the most important innov-
ation—represents a short-term outcome, especially
because the innovation may just have been introduced
on the market last year and no longer than three years
ago. Thus, a renewed demand for the share after ﬁve
or even seven years may expectedly result in higher
shares and thus more positive effects stemming from
the relationships.

for. Second,

Collaboration on product innovation was meas-
ured by asking, ‘‘Did your company within the last
three years introduce new or improved products de-
veloped in collaboration with external partners?’’ In
the same way, collaboration on process innovation
was assessed and included as a control variable in the
analysis. A key variable, stressed in the literature, is
general alliance experience—and not specifically as-
sociated with NPD—which is expected to increase the
absorptive capacity of the receiver as well as to con-
tribute to conﬂict resolution and smoothening of the
alliance evolution and process in itself (Dyer and
Singh, 1998; Gulati, 1995). The variable was origin-
ally included in the regression analysis, but due to a

poor response rate the variable disturbed the regres-
sion and was subsequently deleted. Instead, collabor-
ation on product and process innovation was included
to capture the specific alliance experience effect.

Dummies are used for industries with food and
beverages as the reference category, and ﬁnally, a size
dummy is employed using small ﬁrms as the reference
category. Country dummies are not included, because
a test including both dummies and a test without the
dummies gave resulted in similar key parameters.

Results

Frequency of Relationship Interaction

In this section R1 and R2 are addressed. First of all,
the average number of relationship types included at
the stage of the original idea was 1.50, and for the
completion of the innovation the average was 1.22,
which is significantly different at the 5% level (t-test).
Thus, on average more relationships are explored and
used at the early stages of the NPD processes com-
pared to the completion of the innovation. However,
from a company perspective the difference between
1.5 and 1.22 may not seem high. If, however, it is as-
sumed that small ﬁrms, because of fewer resources
and lack of time, on average interact with fewer ﬁrms,
then the fact that 62.2% of the ﬁrms are small may
raise the perception of the number of relationship
types. In total, the ﬁrms have between 0.94 relation-
ships to 1.17 per ﬁrm depending on the industry. For
the ﬁve industries the average number of relationships
per ﬁrm for the most important innovation are (1)
food and beverages (1.12); (2) paint and varnishes
(1.17); (3) computer services (1.17); (4) telecom equip-
ment (0.94); and telecom services (1.06).

Industry differences. Table 3 presents the interin-
dustry differences based on the sample. As for all sec-
tors, customers are more frequently involved in NPD
than any other type of relationship. Furthermore, com-
petitors are relatively more important in paint and
varnishes (44.7%) than in any other sector. Suppliers
are more important in the food industry but are high
for all industries. Universities and PRIs and consult-
ants are used much less frequently (used by 12 to 29%
of the ﬁrms) than the other types of relationships.

One of the arguments for the use of consultants
stressed previously is the problem of getting enough
highly skilled employees. This particular labor market
problem has been prevalent, especially in telecom

software. Moreover, the division of labor and assign-
ment of tasks is easy to carry out in this industry as
well. Thus, it is not surprising that consultants are
used more frequently in this industry compared to the
others.

This result can be coupled with the relative high
growth rates in the information technology sectors,
where the use of external consultants is viewed as one
way to respond to the increasing demand and explo-
sion in the technological development. Hence, con-
sultants may be used as a labor market buffer where
they are hired to do specific jobs such as software de-
velopment of a limited duration (Knudsen, 2005).

A further investigation of the industry differences is
carried out on the coupling between the industry as-
sociation of the respondent and the industry associa-
tion of the most important relationship. In the data
collection process respondents were asked to name the
most important type of relationship (e.g., a customer)
and then subsequently to name the industry of this

particular partner. After the data collection was
completed, the industries were grouped according to
the NACE classiﬁcation. Table 4 illustrates the asso-
ciation of the most important relationship at the
stage of the original idea—labeled either a customer,
a supplier, or a competitor. Similarly, Table 5 illus-
trates the same ﬁgures for the stage of completion of
the innovation.

It appears from Tables 4 and 5 that in only one case
the most frequent industry choice is different from the
industry of the ﬁrm. That is, the ﬁrms tend to partner
with ﬁrms with which they share the same industry
conditions. The exception is telecom equipment—
the completion of innovation stage—where the most
frequent industry choice is telecom and computer ser-
vices. But since these are also closely aligned in terms
of knowledge requirements, this is not surprising
when the original idea stage is investigated.

Another interesting observation is that neither
telecom equipment, telecom services, nor computer

services has competitors as the most important exter-
nal partners, whereas in both the food industry and
paint and varnishes this is prevalent. The observation
is interesting, because it highlights the problems of
having competitors assist in ﬁnalizing the product in-
novations, since they may act opportunistically and
try to capture the core insights from the product de-
velopment process.

In general, the problem of choosing partners from
one’s own industry is the lack of cross-disciplinarity,
which might spark radical new innovations. Even
though the ﬁrms partner many different external
types, as illustrated by the average number of rela-
tionships, these are not necessarily exploiting the full
potential because of the limited range of industries
that the ﬁrms partner.

Differences in use of relationships across the NPD
stages. A second approach is to view the differences
in use of
the types of relationship for each of
the two stages of the NPD process. These differ-
ences are reﬂected in Table 6 for all ﬁve different
relationship types, but only within the particular
type itself: Chi-square tests reveal highly significant
differences in the use of the types of relationship
(1% level).

A large share of ﬁrms use suppliers for NPD; at the
original idea stage 35% used suppliers and at the
completion of innovation stage the share rose to
43.6%. The literature review reveals an argument
for suppliers more frequently being involved in the

completion of innovation as compared to the original
idea which is supported here in this empirical ﬁnding.
It now remains to be tested whether this observation is
positively related to innovative performance, which
follows in the section below.

Not very surprisingly, customers represent the most
preferred external source for NPD with 54.6% using
customers for development of the original idea and
39.2% for the completion of innovation. More sur-
prisingly though, almost the same share of ﬁrms either
did not use customers at all or used customers in both
stages of NPD (37.9% and 31.7%, respectively). The
ﬁrms that did not use customers at all (37.9%) may
then be less customer or market oriented or at least
integrate these to a lesser extent. In support of the
theoretical view these ﬁrms may prove to be more
successful than ﬁrms using customers.

For competitors 36.4% of the respondents indicate
that collaboration with competitors has taken place,
whereas only 9.4% relate to the completion of the in-
novation; in only nine cases these were not continu-
ations
indicating that
competitors are used more often at the stage of the
original idea and only rarely at the stage of comple-
tion alone. These results comply with the theoretical
discussion provided in this article, where it was argued
that it was rather unlikely that competitors would be
included in product development because of the com-
petitive nature of the relationship.

the stage of the original idea and 13.5% at the stage
of completion. A total of 82.5% of the ﬁrms did
not use universities or PRIs at any level of product
development.

In conclusion, it is also interesting to investigate the
combinations of relationships. These interaction ef-
fects are not explored descriptively but solely analyt-
ically in the following section.

Interﬁrm Relationships, Knowledge Flows, and In-
novative Performance. This ﬁnal empirical section
analyzes R3 and R4. Table 7 presents the results
of a stepwise backward regression analysis
for
each of the stages in the product development proc-
ess. The purpose of the stepwise regression is to
select from a large number of independent variables
a subset of variables under some prespeciﬁed criteria
that explains a larger part of the variance in the
dependent variable. The cut-off points were set
at 0.10 for inclusion into the model and 0.15 for
exclusion from the model. The dummy variables—
industry and ﬁrm size—were entered into the model
and were kept in the model
irrespective of their
explanatory power.

A correlation analysis to test for multicollinearity
among all the independent variables at each stage of
the innovation process is reported in Appendix B and
based on Spearman’s rho for nonmetric variables. As
the two largest correlations are 0.44 and 0.36 and the
remaining correlations are significantly lower indi-
cates that multicollinearity is not a significant prob-
lem in the analysis either at the original idea stage or
at the completion of innovation stage.

The results of the regression highlight ﬁrst the
difference in number of relationship types that have
an impact on innovative performance. At the original
idea stage, three relationship types—customers (  ),
suppliers (þ ), and universities and PRIs (þ )—are
significant whereas only customers (  ) have a signi-
ficant but negative effect on innovative performance
at the stage of completion. As the variables primarily
are binary the level of significance may be raised
compared to the commonly accepted level of po.05.
This analysis therefore uses po.1 as the limit for
statistical significance.

Tests on the completion of innovation stage. For the
completion of the innovation, customer involvement

also results in a negative and significant effect on
innovative performance, which is in favor of H3. H2
was rejected since universities and PRIs did not have
any impact on performance. H4 and H5 on, respec-
tively, supplier and competitor involvement found no
support. H6, which states that consultants played a
positive role for innovative performance, was not sup-
ported in the regression analysis, and the results could
therefore not lead to further clariﬁcation of the role
played by this particular external knowledge source.
Finally, H7 is supported and strongly significant,
whereas no support is given to H8 on complementary
knowledge ﬂows.

The industry dummies reveal that only telecom ser-
vices is significantly different from food and beverag-
es. Finally, the size dummy indicates that the new
innovations of larger ﬁrms tend to contribute with
smaller shares of total sales, leading to a negative ef-
fect on innovative performance. This also indicates
that smaller ﬁrms have fewer products that contribute
to innovative performance.

found support

Tests on the original idea stage. H1, on the impact
of collaboration on product innovation to innovative
performance, was not supported in the empirical
model. H5, on the impact of involving competitors
in NPD, did not have any significant effect on
innovative performance for either of
the stages.
Also, H8, on the transfer of complementary knowl-
edge, was not supported. H2, on the positive impact
of universities and PRIs,
in the
empirical analysis—although only tentatively. More-
over, customer involvement had a negative impact
on innovative performance, as was suggested in
H3. Previously it was found that customers was the
most often used type of relationship in NPD, and
combined with the negative effect the data suggest
that the inclusion of customers for the stage of idea
generation has important consequences for alliance
management, which is discussed further
in the
conclusion. Supplier
involvement has a positive
effect, though only tentatively significant (7.1%),
which is in support of the expected effect posed in
H4. This may indicate that suppliers may be involved
to a higher degree, as discussed in the theoretical
review. The reason for this positive effect of supplier
involvement may indicate that the suggested problems
related to supplier input into the development process
are less important than suspected. Finally, supple-
mentary knowledge is positive and highly significant,
as expected from H7.

Interaction effects. Having established the impor-
tance of single relationships, the article now turns to
the combinations of the relationship types. To explore
the potential interaction effects between the relation-
ship types, all possible combinations of the ﬁve rela-
tionship types were tested for each of the stages in the
regression model. The interaction effects are explora-
tively studied, indicating that even though it is possi-
ble
about particular
interactions, this article tested all of the combinations.
The interactions are calculated as the product of the
two single variables. Because the interaction effect will
introduce multicollinearity into the model, a hierarch-
ical regression model setup was applied in which each
interaction effect was introduced sequentially into the
model.

to formulate hypotheses

Table 8 presents the results for the original idea,
whereas for the completion of the innovation neither
of the interaction effects made a significant contribu-
tion to the overall model—interaction terms are in-
cluded when the partiel F is significant (po.05)—and
are therefore not reported.

The ﬁrst test statistics for assessing the model with
interaction effects are the increment to R2 and the
partiel F test. These are calculated in the following
way:

Increment R2 ¼Adjusted R2ðbasic modelÞ

  AdjustedR2
ðmodel with interaction effectÞ

The partiel F test is calculated in the following way:

Fpart ¼ ðððSSQðnewÞ=SSQðbasicÞÞ=1ÞÞ
ððresidual SSQðbasicÞ= df ðbasicÞ :

The partiel F illustrates the increment to the overall
model by including the particular interaction effect
and is used as criterion for inclusion in the ﬁnal
model.

The data in Table 8 (model 1) show that the basic
model, as illustrated in Table 7 as well, explains
22.3% of the variance, and adding the interaction
term between customers and universities increases R2
by 0.2%. Similarly, by adding the interaction term
between suppliers and competitors adds 0.5% to the
basic model (model 3) and 0.5% by adding the com-
bination between universities and competitors (model
4). All three interaction terms are only tentatively sig-
nificant, but the contribution to the overall model is
highly significant (partiel Fo0.05). The article there-
fore proceeds to interpret the single interaction terms.

The combination of suppliers and competitors has a
positive and tentatively significant effect on innova-
tive performance (model 3). Since it was expected that
both suppliers and competitors are familiar with mar-
ket needs, the positive effect is intuitively correct. The
combination of customers and universities (model 2)
seems intuitively sensible since it was expected that the
customer contributes with highly market-oriented
knowledge, whereas the universities supply basic
technical or scientific knowledge. Hence, new prod-
ucts based on both knowledge types would appear to
have the right mix of supply push and demand pull
(Riesz, 1980).

However, the results from Table 8 show that the
combination of customers and universities has a nega-
tive and tentatively significant effect on innovative
performance. Similarly, the combination of universi-
ties and competitors (model 4) is expected to provide
the same synergetic combination of technical knowl-
edge and knowledge related to the market—as pro-
vided by the competitor. But again, the effect is
negative and tentatively significant. To illustrate these
ﬁndings further, the correlation between exchange of
technical or scientific knowledge and knowledge re-
lated to market introduction for customers is exam-
ined (Table 9).

THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF INTERFIRM RELATIONSHIPS

The most interesting observation from Table 9 is
the negative correlation between customers and tech-
nical and scientific knowledge and the positive corre-
lation between customers
and market-oriented
knowledge—irrespective of the stage—which is sup-
ported by the negative and significant correlation be-
tween technical and scientific and the market-oriented
knowledge. Furthermore,
the correlation between
supplementary knowledge and customers is positive
and significant. The fact that supplementary and com-
plementary knowledge are both significantly correlat-
ed with technical and market-oriented knowledge
only underline that both technical and market knowl-
edge may be both supplementary or complementary.
that
customers supply market-oriented knowledge to the
ﬁrm, and this knowledge has a significant and nega-
tive relationship with innovative performance. More-
over,
the combination of external partners with
divergent perspectives—namely technical and scien-
tific or market orientation—induces a wedge in the
product development project that does not, as expect-
ed, provide synergies but instead carries negative im-
plications for the product development performance.

Discussion and Conclusions

This article has demonstrated that external relation-
ships are in fact important for product development
performance. An apparent paradoxical relation was
revealed by the analyses, namely that on the one hand
customer relationships are used more often than other
types of relationships but on the other hand that in
both the original idea and the completion of the in-
novation stages, customer involvement had a negative
impact on innovative performance. The term customer
is most often used as if customers constitute a coher-
ent whole with similar needs, wants, and preferences,
but customers represent a very diverse set of relation-
ships that should be managed as such.

Development of new products that satisfy special-
ized customer needs may only represent the needs of
one particular and narrowly deﬁned customer group
like, for example, lead users as discussed in detail by
von Hippel (1988) and accordingly may not be rele-
vant or interesting to other customer groups. Riesz
(1980) argued that if the market is allowed to choose
the products via input from customers (i.e., market
pull), then a profit- and short-term-oriented perspec-
tive is invoked. This stands in opposition to science

push, where the ﬁrm seeks to produce new products
for new markets with potentially longer-term effects
and subsequent creation of sustained competitive ad-
vantages (Abetti, 1996). Riesz (1980) continued by
arguing that reliance on the market for product de-
velopment input has several weaknesses: (1) The av-
erage customer is unable to articulate needs and wants
for advanced technology based products; (2) the av-
erage customer is unable to conceptualize ideas or
improvements beyond the realm of their own experi-
ence; and (3) the ﬁrm’s may increasingly loose touch
with the technological frontier through a diminishing
awareness of important new technological develop-
ments. This last point is closely associated with the
not-invented-here syndrome (Katz and Allen, 1982).
An important point here is the primarily short-term
orientation of the study, where the article investigates
product innovations within the last three years. Ob-
viously, customer orientation may balance the view of
the ﬁrms in the longer term. Similarly, too much focus
on science can lead the ﬁrm away from the market,
which may also have serious detrimental effects.

If the customers are lead users, Bonner and Walker
(2004) argued that these users will resist new technol-
ogy and products and will insist on incremental im-
provements to existing products, which are unlikely to
create large shares of turnover—the dependent meas-
ure in this study. The implication of this involvement
is that customers get what they need, but this is closely
related to what they already have. Hence, customers
are expected to be more loyal toward the products,
but this does not automatically lead to overall in-
novative performance. To illustrate this point, many
ﬁrms divide their customers according to importance
in alpha and beta groups. If the set of alpha customers
cannot outweigh the beta customers in terms of sales
volume, then the service of this group may lead to the
observed negative effects.

This can to some extent ﬁnd support in the analysis
that revealed a positive and highly significant effect on
innovative performance from patenting. The variable
was based on the application or granting of patents
for the most important innovation, which may be in-
terpreted as the degree of newness of the innovation
(Brockhoff, 2003). Only new technical inventions can
be granted patents, and since no ﬁrm will apply for a
patent unless it ﬁnds it likely that the patent will be
granted (due to the high fees of application) (Archib-
ugi and Pianta, 1996) the article can interpret this
particular patenting variable as the importance of
newness. Therefore newness of the invention has a


134

significant effect on innovative performance, which is
a pointer in direction of the science-based rather than
market-based product development, as the customer
typically represents present-day demand (Brockhoff,
2003). Furthermore, patents may be viewed as means
to protect the knowledge base, which can assist in
safeguarding the projects carried out in collaboration
with existing partners.

One way to manage different customer groups is by
introducing modularity (Sanchez, 1999) into the prod-
uct structure, thereby allowing different dimensions
or product criteria to serve particular needs for par-
ticular product elements or modules. Obviously, the
possibility of developing modules for several diverse
needs raises the question of how much the ﬁrm is
willing to invest. Hence, a ﬁrm needs to decide on the
degree of asset specific investments it is willing to in-
vest in an external partner, which again needs to be
matched with the buyer’s interest in risk-making idio-
syncratic investments (Bensaou and Anderson, 1999).
These observations can be further nuanced through
the negative contribution from two of the interaction
terms on innovative performance. The expectation
was that the combination of customers and also com-
petitors with universities would be a strategically
sound solution because universities contribute with
technical or scientific knowledge whereas customers
and competitors contribute with more market-orient-
ed knowledge. This combination would potentially
make the products better, while keeping the customer
happy and satisﬁed. However, the results showed a
negative effect on innovative performance.

On the other hand, universities supply a scientific
basis to the product development process (i.e., science
push), which contradicts the market-oriented ap-
proach from the customers. Hence, the divergence in
knowledge exchange and the perspective of the exter-
nal partners counteracts instead of adding comple-
mentary and potentially synergy creating resources.
Therefore, when ﬁrms look for external partners for
product development, the single partner type as well
as the combination of partners is vital for product
development performance. However, the present ﬁnd-
ings are in some instances only indicative and there-
fore need further grounding in future research.

Besides customers, the article found that suppliers
and universities and PRIs are important external
sources of knowledge for innovative performance.
Moreover, the combination of suppliers and competi-
tors had a positive, but only tentatively significant,
effect on innovative performance. Combined with the

previous discussion, these ﬁndings support the view
that selection of partners is nontrivial and requires
careful attention to the expected contribution next to
considering the well-known characteristics of trust
and mutuality in building the relationships (Arin˜ o,
Torre, and Ring, 2001). Furthermore, the descriptive
analyses revealed that ﬁrms primarily partner with
ﬁrms from their own industry; for example, paint and
varnishes ﬁrms chose a partner from their own indus-
try in 77% of the cases. In all cases but telecom equip-
ment and telecom services, the most frequent industry
choice is the ﬁrm’s own industry. These ﬁndings com-
bined with the previous discussion can be interpreted
as the ﬁrm’s way of dealing with the complexity of
ﬁnding appropriate partners. Partners from the same
industry share the same conditions and environmental
constraints and are therefore less complicated with
which to identify and outline product development
projects. These results are closely combined with the
ﬁndings on supplementary knowledge, since to some
degree supplementary knowledge can be argued to be
most often exchanged with partners from one’s own
industry.

Supplementary knowledge was positively associat-
ed with innovative performance. Since continued ex-
change of supplementary knowledge may lead to
increasing specialization and decreasing knowledge
gaps between the partners, the ﬁrm may over time
be less able to serve diverse needs of customers and
thus may eventually lead to loss of customers and re-
newed negative effects on performance. The previous
results support the theoretical expectation that sup-
plementary knowledge is easier to apply and use in the
short run, whereas complementary knowledge was
shown to be insigniﬁcant for innovative performance.
Knowing that ﬁrms primarily partner with ﬁrms with-
in their own industry boundaries, it is not surprising
that they primarily exchange supplementary knowl-
edge—that is, knowledge in their area of expertise. If
the theoretical expectation is correct, that comple-
mentary knowledge is a source of success in the long
term, then the challenge for managers will be to in-
clude knowledge compatibility as a decision variable
and accordingly to balance the exchange of supple-
mentary and complementary knowledge requiring a
balance of short- and long-term payoffs. This balance
is closely related to the discussion of exploration and
exploitation (March, 1991).

Through the importance of supplementary knowl-
edge, the issue of double jeopardy becomes a manager-
ial challenge. First, supplementary knowledge leads to

135

innovative performance very quickly but carries only a
limited potential for learning. Second, the exchange of
compatible knowledge sources may lead the partner to
become a competitor later on. This debate has ap-
peared within the last years as a new research topic,
known as coopetition (Bengtsson and Kock, 2000; Tsai,
2002). The challenge for managers is therefore again to
balance the partners according to an appropriate mix
of supplementary and complementary knowledge to
ensure the continuous renewal of the knowledge base
and to avoid that the partners become competitors.
Too much complementarity may, on the other hand,
lead to a dispersed knowledge base and thus highly
fragmented development efforts associated with high
risk, but there are no tendencies in the analysis pointing
to this as a relevant problem. Rather, the ﬁrms need to
focus more on exchange of complementary knowledge
strategically. Hence, both for partner choice and
knowledge exchange, managers need to balance the
long- and short-term goals by managing the external
relationships directly.

Methodological Problems

Some methodological problems in this study need to
be stressed. First, NPD is not accurately described in
a stage model and especially not one as simple as ap-
plied in this article. Product development represents
processes of continuous trial and error combined with
communication and exchange with external partners.
These elements of learning, in both the R&D depart-
ment as well as interdependent departments, must
play a vital role in the use of external relationships.
Second, uncertainties about the data set relate to the
respondent and the definition of the stages. First, the
addressed respondent was the R&D manager of the
ﬁrm, but in some instances the ﬁrm was active in more
than one product line, for example, telecom equip-
ment based on optical networks and photocopiers
with separate R&D managers. If there were separate
R&D managers for each of these two product lines the
study asked for the R&D manager of telecom equip-
ment because this product line is included in the list of
industries that were examined. However, even though
the study team made strong efforts to identify the
correct respondent, it is still unclear whether the re-
spondent was in fact the one who was initially sought.
However, since the study was carried out using tele-
phone interviews, there is some certainty that the ac-
tual respondent is the R&D manager. Second, the

perception of the stages as they are deﬁned in the
questionnaire may still vary across the respondents. In
deﬁning the idea stage, the respondent was instructed
that ideas are general concepts on what might be
technically or economically feasible and that by com-
pletion of the innovation, they should consider the
time period during which the innovation was devel-
oped until ﬁnalization and market introduction. Fi-
nally, as mentioned earlier the performance construct
is a very simplistic one and as discussed already rep-
resents only short-term performance. Obviously,
measures applicable to assess long-term performance
and evolution would be preferred, but also here fur-
ther research must be called for.

Future Research Opportunities

The presented results highlight the need for further
research, especially on four aspects. First, the mix of
relationship types and their contribution to the
knowledge base must be investigated further. This
article has presented some preliminary evidence but
also has highlighted some of the problems in the pres-
ent approach. Do particular relationship types con-
tribute with, for example, complementary knowledge,
and does it have an effect in longer term? The analysis
also pointed to the problems of balancing the knowl-
edge input, and future research could contribute by
examining what appropriate antecedents and mecha-
nisms can make ﬁrms focus to a higher extent on
complementary knowledge. Following on that, how
can the performance measure be associated with the
length of the relationships and longer-term measure-
ments to allow for empirical testing of the remaining
hypotheses? Third, the strength-of-ties perspective
could prove valuable to the assessment of the rela-
tionship between knowledge ﬂows and innovative per-
formance based on the stage of relationship evolution
and content. Finally, does the type of ﬁrm matter—
for example, ﬁrst mover compared to being a follow-
er—and what about the innovation type? Do radical
innovations appear in more closed settings and incre-
mental innovations in close collaboration with exter-
nal partners? What is the role of the degree of
embeddedness of the partner for innovative perform-
ance; that is, is embeddedness a moderating or medi-
ating variable? These are all questions that would
further understanding of new product development in
a network perspective and should be strongly encour-
aged for future research.
