Using data collected in 2004 from 132 Victorian (Australia) public healthcare
providers, comprising metropolitan and regional hospital networks, rural hospitals
and community health centres, we investigated the perceptions of HRM from the
experiences of chief executive officers, HR directors and other senior managers. We
found some evidence that managers in healthcare organisations reported different
perceptions of strategic HRM and a limited focus on collection and linking of HR
performance data with organisational performance management processes. Using
multiple moderator regression and multivariate analysis of variance, signiﬁcant
differences were found in perceptions of strategic HRM and HR priorities between
chief executive officers, HR directors and other senior managers in the large
organisations. This suggested that the strategic human management paradigm
is ‘lost in translation’, particularly in large organisations, and consequently
opportunities to understand and develop the link between people management
practices and improved organisational outcomes may be missed. There is some
support for the relationship between strategic HRM and improved organisational
outcomes. Implications of these ﬁndings are drawn for managerial practice.

Internationally there is a growing body of research that explores the critical role

of strategic HRM in improving organisational outcomes with some evidence of a
measurable and positive impact on organisational performance (Delaney and
Huselid, 1996; Huselid et al., 1997; Godard, 2004). While much of this research has
been carried out in manufacturing where performance in terms of output or share
price is perhaps easy to measure, more recently attention has been given to the
healthcare sector, where studies from the US and the UK have demonstrated some
links between people management practices and improved organisational outcomes
(Aiken et al., 2000; West et al., 2002).

In this article we report on evidence from public healthcare organisations in
Victoria, Australia. Using survey data collected in 2004 from 132 Victorian public
health facilities, we investigated the adoption of strategic HRM from the reported
experiences of chief executive officers (CEOs), HR directors (HRDs) and other senior
managers (SMs). In this article, ﬁrst, we investigate links between HRM and

performance in healthcare settings and the extent to which healthcare organisations
are monitoring HRM. Second, we explore differences and similarities in perspectives
of strategic HRM from the respondent groups. Finally, we provide insights into some
of the factors associated with these similarities and differences.

STRATEGIC HRM AND ORGANISATIONAL PERFORMANCE

Strategic HR theory suggests that the HR functions should consistently inﬂuence
employee and management behaviour so as to enable and achieve the strategic
plans of the organisation (Boxall and Purcell, 2003). Recent research has identiﬁed
a link between strategic HR practices and organisational outcomes suggesting
the importance of a set of internally consistent policies and practices that ensure a
ﬁrm’s human capital contributes to the achievement of its business objectives –
through compensation systems, team-based job designs, ﬂexible workforces, quality
improvement practices and employee empowerment
(Lado and Wilson, 1994;
Huselid et al., 1997).

In theory, a labour-intensive, highly motivated, highly skilled professional
workforce, as in the healthcare sector, should be an ideal context for the successful
implementation of strategic HR practices. Despite empirical studies identifying the
difficulties of practising HRM in the largely government funded health sector (Bach,
2000; Stanton et al., 2004), recent writers have highlighted the need for better people
management practices in healthcare that directly support other goals such as
providing a quality and safe service and hence improving healthcare performance
and patient outcome (Stanton, 2002; Leggat and Dwyer, 2005).

MEASUREMENT AND MONITORING HRM

A central tenet of high performance organisations is the measurement of the impact
of HR practices and policies on organisational performance (Godard, 2004). A major
problem in the healthcare sector is the contentious nature of the measurement of
performance, with international studies attempting to link people management
practices to patient mortality in acute hospitals. Studies of the ‘magnet’ hospitals in
the US focused on those hospitals that attracted and retained good nurses through
their people management practices. These studies explored the relationship between
good nursing care and mortality rates arguing that ‘magnet’ hospitals had lower
patient mortality rates (Aiken et al., 2000; Upenieks, 2003). Kramer and Schmalenberg
(2004) suggested that nurses employed at magnet hospitals experienced higher levels
of empowerment and job satisfaction due to greater accessibility of magnet nurse
leaders, better support of clinical nurse autonomous decision-making by these
leaders and greater access to work empowerment structures (e.g. information and
resources). West et al. (2002) also focused on patient mortality in the UK but included
a range of people management practices including appraisal, teamwork and training,
suggesting a link between these speciﬁc practices and lower patient mortality.

However, there are limitations with these studies: ﬁrst, direct causal links between
speciﬁc HR practices and patient outcome are difficult to prove due to the presence
of so many other potential variables, and second, patient mortality alone is an
unreliable measure of performance. With increased consumer expectations of better

treatment, coupled with the pressure from government funders to ensure high
quality safe healthcare with ﬁnancial sustainability, healthcare organisations are
increasingly required to identify more extensive performance measures. The strong
positive link between monitoring performance and improving organisational
performance has been well documented (Scanlon et al., 2001;
Julian, 2002).
Performance information is important
to improve organisational effectiveness,
ensure accountability, monitor management and foster collaboration within the
sector (Leggat et al., 1998). The experience of health service organisations in
monitoring performance has suggested the need to consider a range of performance
indicators including ﬁnancial indicators; service indicators that focus on satisfaction
with service delivery; and clinical indicators that evaluate the processes of care
and/or the resulting patient outcomes (Ballard, 2003). However, in this debate the
measurement of HR outcomes and the link with organisational performance is
hardly recognised (Leggat et al., 2005).

Organisations
and
understanding the linking mechanisms through which the organisation, groups
and individuals interact is essential if the components of organisational performance
and the links with HRM are to be identiﬁed. The HR–performance relationship and
the systems and strategic perspectives ‘help stage’ how HR practices and their
inﬂuences on employee attributes can lead to desired outcomes (Bowen and Ostroff,
2004: 204) and assume implicit, multi-level relationships among HR practices,
individual employee attributes and organisational performance (Huselid, 1995). The
HR system and processes can send signals to employees that allow them to
understand the desired and appropriate individual and collective responses (Bowen
and Ostroff, 2004). Bowen and Ostroff (2004) argue that if the HR system is perceived
as high in distinctiveness, consistency and consensus it will create a ‘strong situation’
and consistent
organisational
performance. They suggest that distinctiveness of the HR system is dependent on
four characteristics of HRM: visibility, understandability, legitimacy of authority and
relevance. Consistency of HRM is dependent on instrumentality, validity and
consistent HR messages. Consensus is dependent on agreement among principal HR
decision-makers and fairness of HR practices (see Bowen and Ostroff, 2004, for a
more in-depth discussion of these concepts). The authors propose that a ‘strong
HRM system can enhance organisational performance owing to shared meanings in
promotion of collective responses that are consistent with the organisational strategic
goals’ (Bowen and Ostroff, 2004: 213). If HR systems are weak, HR practices will
send messages that are ambiguous and subject to individual interpretation leading
to inconsistency of practice that can impact on employee performance.

and thereby

The role of key organisational decision-makers such as the senior management
team in developing consensus and agreement among principal HR messages
is critical
to developing a strong HR system and subsequent organisational
performance (Fiske and Taylor, 1991; Klein et al., 2001). Moreover, agreement among
message senders helps to promote consensus among line managers and employees
(Fiske and Taylor, 1991). The strategic HR paradigm indicates that the senior

management team sets the strategic goals and designs the system of HR practices
for achieving those goals (Schuler and Jackson, 1987; Godard, 2004). When
individual message senders are in strong agreement among themselves concerning
the message, they are more likely to form consensus of the HR message (Bowen and
Ostroff, 2004).

Conﬁrmation of

the exchange of

tacit knowledge that enables

the factors related to within-group agreement of senior
management teams is an evolving area of research. According to Lado and Wilson
(1994) integration and close interactions among HR managers, SMs and the CEO
foster
the formulation and
implementation of HR practices that ensure the achievement of the strategic goals of
the organisation. Klein et al. (2001) hypothesised that the greater dispersion of
within-group demographic variables such as age, education, pay, tenure and gender,
the greater the variability in group members’ perception of the work environment.
Moreover, studies have increasingly documented that within-group dispersion of
demographic variables, skills, attitudes, perceptions or values is positively related to
group creativity, but negatively related to social
integration within the group,
cohesion, speed of decision-making and ease of decision implementation (Hambrick,
1994; Bliese and Halverson, 1998).

A large body of organisational theory and research suggests that interaction
among members of a group fosters similarity among group members’ beliefs and
perceptions (Klein et al., 2001). Hambrick (1994) argued that high behavioural
integration among the members of a senior management team enhances perceptual
agreement. Rentsch (1990) using network analysis found that people involved in the
same interaction groups attached similar meanings to organisational practices,
whereas people attached to different groups attached different meanings to these
events. In line with this, it can be argued that greater social interaction between the
management team in smaller organisations relative to larger organisations results in
greater local ownership and participation (Wilkin et al., 2003). This can be explained
by size causing structural complexity (horizontal structural differentiation multiplied
by vertical structural differentiation) and thereby creating more bureaucratic
organisational layers (Donaldson, 2001). Further compacting this relationship are the
ﬁndings that small organisations generally have fewer formalised HR practices than
their larger counterparts (Guest and Conway, 1999; Bartram, 2005).

Hence, in this study, we pose four key questions. First, is there a link between
HRM and performance in the healthcare settings? Second, to what extent are
Australian healthcare organisations monitoring HRM and linking it to organisational
performance? Third, what are the differences and similarities in perspectives of
strategic HRM from the respondent groups? Finally, what are some of the factors
associated with these similarities and differences?

METHODOLOGY

Between December 2003 and April 2004, we conducted a survey of 132 public
healthcare facilities in Victoria, Australia, including metropolitan health services
which are large city-based hospital networks, large regional base hospitals, smaller
district and rural hospitals and community health services. Five hundred and
thirty-six questionnaires were distributed to the CEO, HRD and two other SMs in

each organisation. A total of 184 questionnaires (34 per cent response rate overall)
were returned, including 64 from CEOs, 35 from HRDs and 85 from SMs (almost 50
per cent response from CEOs and an estimated 90 per cent response rate from HRDs
as all organisations do not have a designated HRD). The HRDs’ questionnaire
contained a series of questions relating to HR outcomes. After considerable
consultation with CEOs and HRDs from the industry the researchers were informed
that only HRDs would keep HR outcome information. We only received 35
completed questionnaires related to HR outcomes. Therefore,
the exploratory
correlation analysis is undertaken with a sample size of 35 organisations. The
performance monitoring analysis was undertaken with a sample of 64 CEOs.

Participant hospitals, CEO and HRD names and contact details were provided by
the Victorian Hospitals’ Industrial Association (VHIA, employer association) from
their membership database. Three questionnaires were mailed to the CEO, one for
the CEO to complete and the other two questionnaires to be passed on to SMs. This
method of recruitment was used as the VHIA does not keep names and contact
details of SMs (e.g. directors of nursing, team leaders, assistant directors of nursing
or chief ﬁnancial officers). One questionnaire was mailed to the HRDs in the sample.
All of the questionnaires were returned by mail and were coded using SPSS.

Measures

The questionnaires were developed through collaboration between academics and
HRDs. All Cronbach alpha estimates of internal reliability exceeded the 0.7 level
recommended by Nunnally (1978).

Strategic HRM The strategic HRM index, a 13-item modiﬁed measure (Huselid,
1995), was used to assess the extent to which management strategically integrated
HR strategic planning (see Appendix 1). Example items included ‘human resource
strategies are effectively integrated with this organisation’s strategy’ and ‘human
resource practices are integrated to be consistent with each other’, rated on a
ﬁve-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
As a result of a principal components analysis 10 items were summed to form an
index of strategic HRM for the investigation of HRM and its impact on HR outcomes
(mean = 34.82, SD = 5.69, alpha = 0.82). See below for a discussion of the principal
components analysis.

HR priorities The 13-item measure was adapted from West et al. (2002) (see
Appendix 2). Respondents were asked ‘The human resource management strategy of
this organisation places a very high priority on’ 13 different facets of hospital
operation, such as ‘reducing labour costs’ and ‘effective healthcare teams’. As a result
of a principal components analysis 11 items were summed to form an index of HR
priorities (mean = 42.76, SD = 5.89, alpha = 0.87). See below for discussion of the
principal components analysis.

HR functions These measures were adapted from the EQUIP Guide: A Framework to
Improve Quality and Safety of Health Care, developed by the Australian Council on
Health Care Standards (ACHS). ACHS is an independent, not-for-proﬁt organisation
dedicated to improving the quality and safety of healthcare in Australia through

continual review of performance, assessment and accreditation (ACHS, 2003). The
Council is responsible for assigning accreditation status to healthcare providers and
achievement of this accreditation is a requirement of the Victorian government.

‘Recruitment,

All HR functional areas were rated on a ﬁve-point Likert-type scale ranging from
1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). HR planning comprised a ﬁve-item
measure. An example item includes ‘the workforce plan is clearly linked to the
organisation’s strategic direction’. The items were summed to form a composite
measure (mean = 16.02, SD = 3.46, alpha = 0.80). Recruitment and selection comprised
an eight-item measure. An example item includes
selection,
appointment, credentialing and continuing employment processes are transparent
and equitable’. The items were summed to form a composite measure (mean = 34.48,
SD = 3.29, alpha = 0.79). Training and development was a 12-item measure. An
example item includes ‘Staff contribute to the planning of
the learning and
development system’. The items were summed to form a composite measure
(mean = 43.60, SD = 7.17, alpha = 0.90). Performance management used a 17-item
measure. An example item is ‘The performance management criteria reﬂect the
strategic goals of the organisation’. The items were summed to form a composite
measure (mean = 67.09, SD = 7.42, alpha = 0.86). Equal employment opportunity
(EEO) was also a 17-item measure, with ’Information sessions are carried out to
explain EEO policy’ an example. The items were summed to form a composite
measure (mean = 58.81, SD = 12.30, alpha = 0.91). The employee participation
measure comprised a measure of nine items. An example item is ‘This organisation
joint
has a formal
consultation committee of management and employee
representatives’. The
summed to form a composite measure
items were
(mean = 34.45, SD = 4.81, alpha = 0.78).

HR outcomes These measures were also adapted from the EQUIP Guide (ACHS,
2003). While there is no requirement that an organisation must monitor speciﬁc
indicators or quantitative measures, the accreditation guidelines place a strong
emphasis on monitoring and benchmarking performance. In the development of
measurement of HR outcomes, organisations need to consider indicators and
activities that relate to the health services they provide and for the size and type of
the organisation. In developing these questions the researchers undertook extensive
discussions with HRDs and CEOs within the industry, and the ﬁnal list of HR
outcome questions (see Appendix 3) was agreed upon by the researchers and SMs to
be the most valuable and widely collected outcome data.

The HRDs were asked to provide organisational data (last ﬁnancial year
2002–2003) for HR outcomes for their organisations. The outcomes were recorded in
absolute numbers for each organisation. Organisation size was controlled for by
taking a ratio of absolute outcome and the number of equivalent full-time staff for
each organisation. HR outcomes included number of staff leaving voluntarily;
number of reported complaints pertaining to lack of training and development
opportunities; number of grievances lodged; number of complaints due to
organisational change; number of disciplinary actions; number of stress-related leave
episodes; number of incident reports lodged; number of hours lost through injury;
and the number of WorkCover (sickness and accidents insurance) complaints
exceeding 20 days.

Organisational size, tenure of the manager and time in industry of the
manager All of these variables were treated as continuous variables.

Gender Gender was coded as a dichotomous variable.

Organisational performance monitoring

A combination of open-ended and structured questions were used to explore how
the CEOs monitored performance, including HR outcomes, within their organisation,
as well as how they judged the performance of peer organisations. In the structured
questions the researchers asked about
the use of indicators that would most
commonly monitor the ﬁnancial (such as ﬁnancial results and service volumes),
service (such as waiting lists and staff and patient satisfaction ratings) and clinical
(such as adverse events, clinical outcomes, functional status) perspectives.

PROCEDURE AND RESULTS

Strategic HRM and its impact on HR outcomes

First, given the limitations of the data, exploratory analyses using zero-order
correlations were initially performed between the summed components of the
strategic HRM index, the summed components of measures of HR functions and the
HR outcomes listed previously. Theoretically, we would assume that organisational
strategy (strategic HRM index) would be positively associated with the HR functions
(i.e. organisational ﬁt) (Huselid et al., 1997). Moreover, we would also assume that the
HR functions would also be positively associated with one another (i.e. HR ﬁt)
(Schuler and Jackson, 1987). It can also be surmised that the HR functions would
exhibit stronger associations with HR outcomes than the strategic HRM index, as the
HR functions are the techniques that shape and inﬂuence employee behaviours (e.g.
HR outcomes) (Schuler and Jackson, 1987).

Strategic HRM index

From Table 1 we see that the strategic HRM index was positively correlated with
only one HR outcome – the number of incident reports lodged (r = 0.43, p < 0.05).
This may be interpreted as improvements in systematic record keeping and a culture
of reporting incidents. In relation to HR functions the strategic HRM index was
positively correlated with performance management (r = 0.55, p < 0.01), HR planning
(r = 0.78, p < 0.01), recruitment and selection (r = 0.33, p < 0.05) and HR development
(r = 0.41, p < 0.05).

HR functions

The HR planning measure was negatively correlated with the number of complaints
about training and development (r = -0.41, p < 0.05) and organisational change
(r = -0.50, p < 0.01). The performance management measure was negatively
correlated with the number of hours lost through injury (r = -0.46, p < 0.05). The HR
development measure was negatively correlated with the number of staff leaving
voluntarily (r = -0.51, p < 0.05), the number of hours lost through injury (r = -0.47,
p < 0.05), the total number of WorkCover (accident and sickness insurance) claims

exceeding 20 days (r = -0.68, p < 0.01) and the number of disciplinary actions
(r = -0.39, p < 0.1). The EEO measure was negatively correlated with the number of
disciplinary actions (r = -0.45, p < 0.05) and the number of hours lost through injury
(r = -0.68, p < 0.01). The recruitment and selection measure was positively correlated
with the number of stress-related leave episodes (r = 0.44, p < 0.05). The employee
participation measure was negatively associated with the number of disciplinary
actions (r = -0.44, p < 0.05) and hours lost due to injury (r = -0.54, p < 0.05). Overall,
the ﬁndings show that the HR functions were associated with various positive HR
outcomes.

Organisational performance: use of performance indicators

The respondents completed a table that outlined possible performance indicators and
identiﬁed how these indicators were used in monitoring performance in the
organisation. The use options included:

(cid:129) discussion regularly at senior/executive management meetings
(cid:129) report to the Board
(cid:129) report to funding agencies
(cid:129) publicly available community report
(cid:129) benchmark with other organisations
(cid:129) visible link to staff performance management.

It should also be noted that the CEOs were given the opportunity to mention other
indicators that they used to track their organisation’s (or service’s/department’s)
operational performance (e.g. any HR indicators they monitored). HR indicators were
scarcely mentioned. For example, 3 per cent reported the use of performance
appraisal. This may indicate that many of the respondents may not use HR
indicators.

Table 2 presents the indicators and how they are used as reported by the CEOs.
Overall, the CEOs reported a strong focus on ﬁnancial, volume and patient/client
satisfaction indicators and indicators related to accreditation. Receiving much less
attention were indicators related to the outcomes of healthcare processes, such
as adverse events, clinical outcomes,
functional status of patients/clients and
community reintegration of patients/clients.

As shown in Table 2, for the most part the performance indicators were discussed
at senior/executive management meetings and were reported to the Board of
Directors. There was substantial variation in the reporting to funding agencies,
probably as a result of the varying reporting requirements of the government
funder of most of these agencies. Despite the focus in the accreditation process
on benchmarking,
they
benchmarked their performance on any of these indicators with other organisations.
With regard to strategic HRM few organisations
linked staff performance
management processes with these performance indicators. Notably, despite the
importance of achieving ﬁnancial and volume targets in the Victorian system, less
than half of the CEO respondents indicated that they linked these indicators with the
internal performance management processes.

the CEO respondents reported that

Linking performance indicators to staff performance management

As shown in Table 3, the CEOs were less likely to report that the performance measures
had a visible link with the organisational staff performance management. On average
just over 40 per cent of the metropolitan hospital CEOs reported linking of the
identiﬁed performance indicators to the staff performance management processes, and
fewer than 30 per cent of the CEOs of the other organisational categories reported
linking. The metropolitan hospital CEOs reported linking the ﬁnancial results to the
greatest extent (88 per cent), with some linking of the service indicators but less
emphasis on linking clinical indicators. In contrast, the regional (71 per cent) and
district (100 per cent) hospitals and community health centres (71 per cent) reported
the greatest focus on linking patient satisfaction measures, compared with only 38 per
cent of the metropolitan hospital CEOs (Leggat et al., 2005).

These data suggest that despite the large HR components of the budgets of these
service providers,
the public health sector CEOs do not have strategic HR
mechanisms in place that enable them to link outcomes with performance
expectations.

Perceptions of strategic HRM

Principal components analysis

Strategic HRM

To check the unidimensionality of the strategic HRM index (Huselid, 1995), a
principal components analysis was conducted on the 13 items of the strategic HRM
scale. This analysis revealed that three of the items (i.e. items 3, 4 and 5) did not
load satisfactorily on the principal component. These three items were therefore
removed and the results of
the ensuing principal components analysis are
presented in Table 4, which shows that the remaining 10 items loaded satisfactorily
according to the 0.5 criterion of Hair et al.
the internal

reliability coefficient of the 10-item strategic HRM scale was 0.82, which indicates
that the 10-item scale has satisfactory internal reliability according to Nunnally’s
(1978) 0.7 criterion. The scores for these 10 items were averaged to obtain an
overall strategic HRM score.

HR priorities

To check the unidimensionality of the HR priorities scale (West et al., 2002), a
principal components analysis was conducted on the 13 items of the scale. This
analysis revealed that two of the items (i.e. items 1 and 4) did not load satisfactorily
on the principal component. These two items were therefore removed and the results
of the ensuing principal components analysis are presented in Table 5, which shows
that the remaining 11 items loaded satisfactorily according to the 0.5 criterion of Hair
et al. (1998). Furthermore, the internal reliability coefficient of the 11-item strategic
HRM scale was 0.90, which indicates that the 11-item scale has satisfactory internal

reliability according to Nunnally’s (1978) 0.7 criterion. The scores for these 11 items
were averaged to obtain an overall HR priorities score.

One-way MANOVA

It should be noted that it was not possible to match the respondents within the
organisational units because of inadequate responses matching the three types of
managers (e.g. CEO, HRD and SM) within organisations (only 26 complete matches).
The analysis of the different managers is based on their perceptions of strategic
HRM. This may not reﬂect organisational reality, but perception may guide day-
to-day behaviour. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was
conducted with managerial role (e.g. CEO, HRD and SM) as the independent
variable and strategic HRM and HR priorities as the dependent variables. A one-way
MANOVA is a dependence technique that measures the differences for two or more
metric dependent variables based on a set of non-metric variables acting as
independent variables (Hair et al., 1998). It should also be noted that SMs in this
article were treated as a homogeneous group as there were no statistically signiﬁcant
differences between mean responses of SMs in relation to the strategic HRM and HR
priorities scales. The assumption of homogeneity of variance was supported for both
strategic HRM (F = 1.05, p > 0.05) and HR priorities (F = 0.80, p > 0.05) according to
Levene’s test. Table 6 contains the means and standard deviations for strategic HRM
and HR priorities for the three groups of respondents.

The MANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant multivariate effect that was consistent across
several criteria: Pillai’s trace (0.07, p < 0.05), Wilks’s lambda (0.94, p < 0.05),
Hotelling’s trace (0.07, p < 0.05) and Roy’s largest root (0.04, p < 0.05). Fisher’s least
signiﬁcant difference post hoc tests revealed that CEOs reported higher levels of
strategic HRM than did managers whilst no other signiﬁcant differences in strategic
HRM were found. No signiﬁcant differences in HR priorities were found between the
three groups.

Size ¥ managerial role interaction

A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted using the product term to examine
the moderating effects of managerial role on the relationship between size and
strategic HRM. The size variable was standardised and the product term was created
by multiplying the standardised size variable with managerial role. This procedure
reduces problems of collinearity that are associated with the product term. This
analysis revealed a signiﬁcant interaction effect (b = -0.10, p < 0.05, DR2 = 0.02).

To more closely examine the interaction effect, size was split into three groups (i.e.
small, which comprised organisations with less than 146 employees, n = 61; medium,
which comprised organisations with more than 146 employees but less than 430
employees, n = 65; and large, which comprised organisations with more than 430
employees, n = 58) using the 33rd and 67th percentiles as cut-off points (Cohen et al.,
2003).

A MANOVA was conducted for each of the three groups of size using role as the
independent variable and strategic HRM and HR priorities as dependent variables
(Hair et al., 1998). For the small and medium groups, the assumption of homogeneity
of variance was supported for both strategic HRM and HR priorities according to
Levene’s test. However, for the large group, Levene’s test indicated that although the
assumption of homogeneity of variance was supported for strategic HRM it was not
supported for HR priorities (F = 4.79, p < 0.05).

The MANOVA revealed no signiﬁcant differences in perceptions of strategic HRM
and HR priorities between CEOs (n = 23), HRDs (n = 11) and SMs (n = 27) in the
small group. Similarly,
the MANOVA revealed no signiﬁcant differences in
perceptions of strategic HRM and HR priorities between CEOs (n = 22), HRDs (n = 9)
and SMs (n = 34) in the medium group. In contrast, the MANOVA found a signiﬁcant
multivariate effect for the large group (i.e. Pillai’s trace 0.29, p < 0.01). Speciﬁcally,
signiﬁcant differences were found in perceptions of strategic HRM (F = 5.75, p < 0.05)
and HR priorities (F = 4.37, p < 0.05) between CEOs (n = 18), HRDs (n = 16) and SMs
(n = 24) in the large group. According to Fisher’s least signiﬁcant difference post hoc
test, which assumes homogeneity of variance, managers in large organisations
reported lower levels of strategic HRM than did their CEOs and HRDs whilst there
was a non-signiﬁcant difference in strategic HRM between CEOs and HRDs.
Furthermore, according to Tamhane’s post hoc test, which does not assume
homogeneity of variance, managers in large organisations reported lower levels of
HR priorities than did their HRDs whilst there was a non-signiﬁcant difference in
strategic HRM between CEOs and HRDs. Table 7 provides the means and standard
deviations of strategic HRM and HR priorities for the CEOs, HRDs and SMs
according to the size of the ﬁrm.

Furthermore, Appendix 4 shows the means and frequencies for CEOs, HRDs and
SMs in terms of time in industry of manager, tenure of manager and gender of
manager. No statistically signiﬁcant differences are found between CEOs, HRDs and
SMs in terms of tenure or gender. Chief executive officers have longer time in the
industry relative to the other managers.

Stepwise regression

An exploratory stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using
role, size, tenure, gender and time in industry as independent variables to examine
which of these were the best predictors of strategic HRM. A stepwise regression
analysis retains only signiﬁcant predictors of the dependent variable in the model
(Cohen et al., 2003).

As shown in Table 8, the ﬁnal model contained only time in industry, role and
gender. More speciﬁcally, time in industry was correlated positively with perceptions
of strategic HRM, role was correlated negatively with strategic HRM indicating that
CEOs reported higher levels of strategic HRM than did SMs, and gender was
correlated negatively with strategic HRM indicating that females reported higher
levels of strategic HRM than did males.

A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using role, size,
tenure, gender and time in industry as independent variables to examine which of
these were the best predictors of strategic HRM. As shown in Table 9, the ﬁnal model
contained only size, which was correlated negatively with perceptions of HR
priorities indicating that perceived levels of HR priorities decreased as the size of the
ﬁrm increased.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

This study investigated the perceptions, monitoring and impact of strategic HRM in
the Victorian public healthcare sector. The ﬁndings are interesting and worthy of

further investigation. First, the study showed positive associations between the HR
functions and HR outcomes suggesting that emphasis on sophisticated people
management practices may be associated with cost-effective outcomes.

Second, results of the organisational size ¥ managerial role interaction found that
organisational size moderated the relationship between role and strategic HRM.
Further analysis using MANOVA revealed that SMs in large organisations had lower
strategic HRM and HR priorities scores relative to both CEOs and HRDs. It appears
that, in the large hospitals (e.g. metropolitan hospitals), SMs may not share the same
positive perceptions of the practice of strategic HRM and rate HR priorities lower in
their organisations relative to the CEOs and HRDs. The ﬁndings indicate that
organisational size is an important factor in explaining differences in perceptions of
strategic HRM and HR priorities among the different groups of managers. These
ﬁndings may be due to larger ﬁrms being more bureaucratic and having greater
structural complexity, which may,

in turn, create less social

The stepwise regression analysis revealed other factors that predict strategic HRM
and HR priorities. Time in industry was correlated positively with perceptions of
strategic HRM, role was correlated negatively with strategic HRM indicating that
CEOs reported higher levels of strategic HRM than did SMs, and gender was
correlated negatively with strategic HRM indicating that females reported higher
levels of strategic HRM than did males. Organisational size, which was correlated
negatively with perceptions of HR priorities, indicated that perceived levels of HR
priorities decreased as the size of the ﬁrm increased. These results again conﬁrm the
importance of organisational size and managerial role in explaining perceptions of
strategic HRM and HR priorities. They also provided some additional information in
that
female CEOs with considerable experience in the industry have higher
perceptions of strategic HRM independent of their tenure or the size of their
organisations.

Moreover, other organisational factors such as history, mandate and clarity of
strategic goals may have an impact. Using moderator regression modelling we were
able to discount some of the characteristics of the managers (such as gender and
tenure) as having an impact on the differences among groups of managers. It is also
possible that other characteristics that we were not able to test, such as clinical/
administrative background and training, may make a contribution to the observed

differences (Leggat and Dwyer, 2005). These ﬁndings are a concern as they suggest
that the senior management team in large organisations may not be ‘singing the
same song’ in relation to HR systems, practices and processes. This in turn can
undermine the distinctiveness and the consistency that Bowen and Ostroff (2004)
identify as key components in the HRM–performance link. Somehow even within
the senior management team the key HR messages may be ‘lost in translation’ and
there is some evidence to suggest that the larger the organisation the more likely the
message is to be lost.

It

Finally, the study also demonstrated limited performance monitoring throughout
the Victorian public health sector. The sector reported a strong focus on ﬁnancial,
activity and patient satisfaction measures, with limited reporting on HR measures
(Leggat et al., 2005).
is acknowledged that effective management requires
appropriate performance measurement and the mechanisms to translate data into
knowledgeable actions – neither of which were strongly demonstrated in this
study. Despite the importance of HRM, this study found limited collecting and
reporting of performance measures related to people management, suggesting that
opportunities to improve people management practice in healthcare organisations
may be missed.

In conclusion, this investigation raises a number of interesting questions for
further exploration at a case study level. The results of this study lend support to the
potential beneﬁts of strategic HRM. However, we see the varying perceptions of
strategic HR-related roles among the three groups of managers in large organisations
and limitations in monitoring HRM as barriers to the development of strategic HRM.
We argue that, until the facilitating and enabling role of HRM is understood and
express
links are made between HRM and the performance management
expectations of staff in relation to achieving patient outcomes, HRM will continue to
be seen as an administrative function vulnerable to ﬁnancial restraint in difficult
times. Despite the evidence that positive practices with positive outcomes are taking
place, much of this experience is being lost in translation within the organisational
environment. These outcomes are not being captured, recognised and then translated
into greater support for and understanding of the potential of strategic HRM.
