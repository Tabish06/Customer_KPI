ABSTRACT. Research
assignment experience enhances awareness of
societal
stakeholders, influences personal values, and provides rare
and valuable resources. Based on these arguments, we
hypothesize that CEO international assignment experi-
ence will lead to increased corporate social performance
(CSP) and will be moderated by the CEO’s functional
background. Using a sample of 393 CEOs of S&P 500
companies and three independent data sources, we find
that CEO international assignment experience is posi-
tively related to CSP and is significantly moderated by the
CEO’s functional background. Specifically, CEOs with
international assignment experience and an output func-
tional background (e.g., marketing and sales) are posi-
tively associated with greater CSP.

Corporate social performance (CSP) represents a
ﬁrm’s ‘‘conﬁguration of principles of social responsi-
bility, processes of social responsiveness, and policies,
programs, and observable outcomes as they relate
to the ﬁrm’s societal relationships’’ (Wood, 1991,
p. 693). Essentially, CSP requires ﬁrms to meet the
performance expectations of
stakeholders
(McGuire et al., 2003). Examples of societal stake-
holders affected by ﬁrms’ strategic decisions and
actions
communities, minorities,
employees, customers, and the natural environment
(Berman et al., 1999; Coombs and Gilley, 2005). As a
result of
increasing stakeholder pressure, general
societal trends, and institutional forces (e.g., Kyoto
Protocol, ‘‘best of’’ rankings) the demands on ﬁrms to
manage both proﬁts and social responsibility have
increased (Waddock and Graves, 1997).

However, societal stakeholders are not the sole
beneﬁciaries of CSP – ﬁrms themselves may reap
beneﬁts from engaging in CSP initiatives. Firms able
to meet or exceed societal expectations may develop
strong positive reputations (Turban and Greening,
1996), enhance ﬁrm legitimacy (Handelman and
Arnold, 1999), strengthen ﬁrm image (Brown and
Dacin, 1997), reduce risk (Husted, 2005), develop
valuable organizational capabilities
(Sharma and
Vredenburg, 1998), and are more likely to be
viewed as ethical (Valentine and Fleischman, 2008).
With potentially beneﬁcial outcomes for both
society and ﬁrms themselves, it is becoming increas-
ingly important to understand the antecedents of CSP
(Waldman et al., 2006). Previous research has noted
the importance of investigation on relevant manage-
rial variables (Thomas and Simerly, 1994; Wood,
1991). Speciﬁcally, the role of the CEO has been
recognized due to its signiﬁcant inﬂuence on CSP
initiatives (Agle et al., 1999). As the leader of the ﬁrm,
the CEO plays a primary role in strategic decision
making and resource allocation (Hosmer, 1982;
Mintzberg, 1978). Therefore, we would expect the
CEO to play a signiﬁcant role in decisions involving
CSP strategies and the amount of resources devoted
to such pursuits. Previous research has supported the
relationship between the CEO and CSP (Hemingway
and Maclagan, 2004; Simerly, 2000; Thomas and
Simerly, 1994; Wood, 1991). Much of this previous
research is grounded in the upper echelons perspec-
tive. Upper echelons research suggests that execu-
tives’ experiences, values, and personalities will affect
their ﬁeld of vision, selective perception, interpreta-
tion, strategic choices, and ultimately ﬁrm perfor-
mance (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1996; Hambrick
and Mason, 1984;
Jackson, 1992). As a result,

organizations become, at least in part, a reﬂection of
their CEO (Hambrick and Mason, 1984).

Upper echelons researchers have extended their
empirical examination beyond the relationships
between conventional demographic variables (e.g.,
age, tenure, education) and ﬁrm ﬁnancial perfor-
mance to a broader set of executive characteristics
and organizational outcomes (Carpenter et al., 2004;
Hambrick, 2007). One of these ‘‘broader’’ executive
characteristics receiving attention by organizational
researchers is international assignment experience –
that is the experience of
living and working in
a foreign country (e.g., Carpenter et al., 2003;
Gregersen et al., 1998). CEO international assign-
ment experience has been related to higher salaries
(Carpenter et al., 2001), greater ﬁrm internationali-
zation (Athanassiou and Nigh, 2000), and increased
ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance (Daily et al., 2000). In
addition, research ﬁndings suggest that international
experience inﬂuences personal values (Suutari and
Makela, 2007) and provides the CEO with rare and
valuable resources (Carpenter et al., 2001). These
ﬁndings prompted the primary question addressed
by the current research – is there a relationship
between CEO international assignment experience
and CSP?

Our

secondary question addresses a potential
moderator to this relationship. A consistent ﬁnding in
upper echelons research is that
functional back-
ground has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on how executives
think and act. Speciﬁcally, functional background has
been shown to directly inﬂuence goal orientations,
time frames, the way problems are deﬁned, infor-
mation processing, and strategic choices (Lawrence
and Lorsch, 1967; Walsh, 1988). As such, we might
expect international assignment experience to have
differential inﬂuences on the CEO based on their
functional background. Thus, we also address a sec-
ondary question – does
functional background
moderate the relationship between CEO interna-
tional assignment experience and CSP?

By addressing these questions, our study will
contribute to existing knowledge in three areas.
First, we will explore an important and previously
unidentiﬁed antecedent of CSP. Second, we will
contribute to our understanding of CEO interna-
tional assignment experience by examining a new
ﬁrm and societal level outcome. Finally, we will seek

The remainder of the paper will unfold as follows.
First, the following section discusses CSP in greater
detail. Second, hypotheses will be developed on
CEO international experience and CSP as well as
the main and moderating effects of CEO functional
background. Third, research methodology, analysis,
and results are presented. Finally, the paper con-
cludes with a discussion of the results, implications,

As previously stated, CSP requires ﬁrms to meet the

the
expectations of these stakeholders, ﬁrms may invest
in social objectives in which returns are uncertain.
But by focusing on long-term objectives and
meeting or exceeding societal expectations, these
ﬁrms expect to be proﬁtable in the long term (Kane,
2002). Adding to this challenge, the demands of
multiple stakeholders may conﬂict. For example, a
ﬁrm may allocate scarce ﬁnancial resources to local
charities satisfying community stakeholders while
neglecting employee expectations for use of those
funds toward enhanced retirement beneﬁts. Thus,
meeting the demands of multiple stakeholders
requires complex strategies in order to achieve a
constant balance.

Many previous investigations have conceptualized
CSP along a single continuum from weak to strong
(Agle et al., 1999; Hillman and Keim, 2001; Turban
and Greening, 1996; Waddock and Graves, 1997).
In such approaches, a ﬁrm’s
inﬂuence on each
stakeholder group is either weak or strong and these
weaknesses and strengths are viewed in aggregate to
represent the CSP construct. As such, ﬁrms may
exhibit weak or strong CSP depending on whether
weaknesses outweigh strengths or vice versa.

More recent

studies have proposed that CSP
strengths and weaknesses may not necessarily repre-
sent opposite ends of a single continuum, but rather

they are less orthogonal and should be considered
separately (Mahoney and Thorn, 2006; McGuire
et al., 2003; Strike et al., 2006). McGuire et al. (2003)
suggests that CSP strengths represent more pro-
active positions and initiatives toward stakeholders
(e.g., development of
innovative products with
environmental beneﬁts), whereas CSP weaknesses
are indicative of socially risky strategies or avoidance
approaches (e.g., poor health and safety standards for
employees). Conceptualized along separate contin-
uums, ﬁrms may exhibit CSP strength and CSP
weakness simultaneously (Strike et al., 2006). In
addition, single continuum approaches do not rec-
ognize the potential for socially irresponsible actions
for which there is no socially responsible counterpart.
For example, Strike et al. (2006) note that violence
against employees would be considered by most to
be socially irresponsible. However, the absence of
violence is not necessarily responsible, but rather a
legal and societal norm.

ignore

Although CSP strengths and weaknesses may not
be orthogonal, a more holistic consideration requires
an examination of CSP strengths countered by CSP
weaknesses. In other words, while single continuum
conceptualizations may

expression, allowing weaknesses to offset strengths
appears necessary in order to obtain a single snapshot
picture of a ﬁrm’s total or net CSP. Therefore, fol-
lowing Mahoney and Thorn (2006), we will con-
ceptualize (and will
subsequently operationalize)
CSP using both approaches – CSP strengths and
weaknesses separately, and total CSP. Thus, we are
able to explore the potentially differential outcomes
for strengths and weaknesses while also examining
the larger picture of total CSP.

CEO international assignment experience
and CSP

The growing body of research on executive inter-
national experience and organizational-level out-
comes has largely examined the positive relationship
between the international experience of top man-
agers and the degree of ﬁrm internationalization
(e.g., Athanassiou and Nigh, 2000; Carpenter et al.,
2003; Carpenter and Fredrickson, 2001). Additional
studies have expanded the focus to suggest a rela-
tionship between CEO international experience,

ﬁrm internationalization, and higher ﬁrm ﬁnancial
performance (Carpenter et al., 2001; Daily et al.,
2000; Roth, 1995; Sambharya, 1996). Interestingly,
outside CEO successors with international experi-
ence are signiﬁcantly and positively related with all
three traditional ﬁrm performance measures (ROI,
ROA, and market-to-book ratio; Daily et al., 2000).
Similarly, international assignment experience was
found to have a positive relationship with both
accounting and market measures of ﬁrm perfor-
mance for multinational corporations
(Carpenter
et al., 2001). One of the mechanisms suggested for
this relationship is the additional cognitive and social
resources gained by the CEO through international
assignment experience (Carpenter et al., 2001).

Rare and valuable resources

et

(Carpenter

al., 2001).

CEOs with international assignment experience
represent a rare and valuable resource (Carpenter
et al., 2001). In fact, many ﬁrms recognize this
valuable resource and are willing to pay higher sal-
aries to CEOs with international assignment expe-
rience, indicating some level of enhanced human
capital
International
assignments often involve a much greater breadth of
responsibilities than typical of domestic activities
(Suutari and Makela, 2007). Through exposure to
new and foreign value systems,
languages, and
institutional environments executives must develop
new solutions as issues arise instead of falling back on
proven strategies in more familiar territory (Ricks
et al., 1990). International assignment also affords the
executive high levels of autonomy which instills
conﬁdence in personal decisions as successful solu-
tions are found (Suutari and Makela, 2007). Com-
bining the breadth of
responsibilities, need for
innovative solutions, and autonomy executives with
international assignment experience become much
more adept at processing complex and dynamic
information (Carpenter et al., 2001).

This increased ability to process complex infor-
mation not only enhances international competen-
cies, such as predicting the needs of foreign customers,
it also enhances general managerial competencies such
as leadership and change management (Suutari and
Makela, 2007). We suggest that this enhanced ability
to process complex and dynamic information may also

translate to CSP. This enhanced ability could prove
invaluable when attempting to meet the conﬂicting
demands of multiple stakeholders. Pursuit of satisfying
the expectations of multiple societal stakeholders –
while also remaining mindful of ﬁrm ﬁnancial stability
– will require innovative solutions in constantly
changing competitive environments. These innova-
tive solutions will likely draw on the ability of the
ﬁrm’s chief decision maker to process this complex
information.

In addition to enhanced ability to process com-
plex information, international assignment experi-
ence also increases
the CEOs global network
(Edstrom and Galbraith, 1977; Suutari and Makela,
2007). As new and difﬁcult societal demands arise,
the CEO has a novel and valuable network on
which to draw for advice or assistance in develop-
ment of a social initiative (e.g., recruitment of a
more diverse workforce). Therefore, with enhanced
ability to process complex information and a unique
global network, international assignment experience
provides the CEO with rare and valuable resources
which may be used to inﬂuence their ﬁrm’s CSP.

The experience of living and working in a foreign
country may also inﬂuence the cognitive orientation
of executives (Hermann and Datta, 2005; Ricks
et al., 1990). Executives often report
their

lasting
impacts on their worldviews and how they manage
their ﬁrms (Carpenter et al., 2000; Gregersen et al.,
1998; Kohonen, 2004). In fact, executives with

their careers
(Gregersen et al., 1998). In-depth interviews of
managers following international assignments indi-
cate a transformational impact on identity (Kohonen,
2004). Research also suggests that when top man-
agers have international experience, their perceptions
and personality take on a more international orien-
tation resulting in a global mindset as a result of
exposure to different value systems and institutional
environments (Gunz and Jalland, 1996; Ricks et al.,
1990; Sambharya, 1996). Thus, CEOs with inter-
national assignment experience may be aware of a
broader set of stakeholders.

This notion is also supported by research on study
abroad experiences of students.1 International expe-
rience has been shown to inﬂuence students’ inter-
national perspectives (Kauffmann et al., 1992; Zorn,
1996), awareness, and appreciation (Carlson and
Widaman, 1988; Dwyer, 2004; Wallace, 1999). This
inﬂuence has also been shown to have a long-term
effect on shaping and inﬂuencing evaluation of world
issues (Dwyer, 2004; Zorn, 1996). Speciﬁcally, indi-
viduals who studied abroad experienced a greater
awareness of global interconnectedness (Chieffo and
Grifﬁths, 2004). Thus, international experience may
enhance the CEOs ability to meet societal expecta-
tions by increasing their awareness of a broader set of
stakeholder demands.

Personal values

Personal values represent individual beliefs about
desirable behaviors
(Schwartz and Bilski, 1987).
These values often have a strong motivational com-
ponent and guide individual actions, behaviors, and
attitudes (Rokeach, 1973). Exposure to a different
culture often leads executives to rethink their own
behavior and value structures (Suutari and Makela,
2007). This ﬁnding is also supported by research on
student international experience. Studying abroad
may lead to an increased interest in world political
and social issues, increased interest in world eco-
nomic conditions, greater open-mindedness and
tolerance of differences, increased empathy (Black
and Duhon, 2006; Thomlison, 1991), and increased
sense of responsibility and respect for others (Chieffo
and Grifﬁths, 2004). Many of these personal out-
comes may inﬂuence a CEOs motivation toward
pursuing CSP. For example, a CEO with a greater
sense of responsibility toward others may be more
likely to encourage charitable contributions toward
local housing and education initiatives. Likewise, a
CEO who empathizes with frustrated customers may
be more likely to pursue quality improvements in
their product.

There are also reasons to suspect that the moti-
vating inﬂuence of international experience remains
in effect long after the experience itself. A large-scale
longitudinal survey of alumni who participated in
study abroad programs between 1950 and 1999
reported that 98% of respondents indicated that their

by
Hemingway and Maclagan (2004) that the personal
values of individual managers is one of the drivers of
CSP. Through international experience, values may
be changed or strengthened (e.g., enhanced empathy
and respect for others) in such a way to motivate the
CEO toward pursuing increased CSP – leading the
ﬁrm to become, at least in part, a reﬂection of its
CEO (Hambrick and Mason, 1984).

Up to this point, we have argued that interna-
tional assignment experience provides the CEO with
rare and valuable resources (e.g., enhanced ability to
process complex information and global networks),
increased awareness of societal expectations (e.g.,
global
stakeholders and interconnectedness), and
changed or strengthened personal values (e.g., open-
mindedness). With potentially
societal
awareness, motivation to act (through personal val-
ues), and unique resources, combined with the dis-
cretion and power afforded by their position, we
suggest
that CEOs with international assignment
experience are willing and able to enhance their
ﬁrms’ CSP. Thus, we hypothesize:

will be positively associated with corporate

CEO functional background

Functional background is a common executive
characteristic studied in upper echelons research due

to its inﬂuence on strategic choice (Hambrick and
Mason, 1984) and the association with a variety of
ﬁrm outcomes (e.g., Gupta and Govindarajan, 1984;
Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Song 1982; Thomas
et al., 1991). An executive’s functional background
has been shown to directly inﬂuence goal orienta-
tions, time frames, the way problems are deﬁned,

Hambrick and Mason (1984) ﬁrst identiﬁed the
more internally oriented functional backgrounds
such as production, process R&D, accounting, and
ﬁnance as ‘throughput’ backgrounds, and the more
externally oriented backgrounds such as marketing,
sales, merchandizing, product R&D, and entrepre-
neurship as ‘output’ backgrounds. Researchers have
previously argued that managers with output-
oriented backgrounds will be better able to recog-
nize the demands of their stakeholders (Simerly,
2000; Thomas and Simerly, 1994). Conversely,
managers with more internally oriented backgrounds
will be more task-oriented and not as sensitive to the
needs of stakeholders (Simerly, 2000). The rela-
tionship between functional background and CSP
has been examined in prior studies which provide
support
that output-oriented
functional background does lead to higher levels of
CSP (Simerly, 2003; Thomas and Simerly, 1994).
Consistent with previous research, we hypothesize:

positively associated with corporate social
performance strengths.

H2b: CEO output functional background will be
negatively associated with corporate social
performance weaknesses.

H2c: CEO output functional background will be

performance.

Beyond the main effect of functional background,
the greater concern for the present study is the
potential moderating effect of functional background
on the relationship between CEO international
assignment experience and CSP. Speciﬁcally, we
suggest that the positive beneﬁts of
international
experience will have the greatest impact on CEOs
with output functional backgrounds, thus leading to
even higher levels of CSP.

Daniel J. Slater and Heather R. Dixon-Fowler

Functional background has been argued to shape
executives’ perceptions and cognitions (e.g., Beyer
et al., 1997; Hambrick and Mason, 1984). There-
fore, the enhanced awareness, personal values, and
resources resulting from international assignment
experience are ﬁltered through different perceptions
and cognitions based on the functional background
of
the CEO. Because they were already more
attuned to stakeholder demands, CEOs with output
backgrounds are more likely to utilize their increased
empathy, greater tolerance, and enhanced ability to
process complex information toward pursuit of CSP
initiatives. Conversely, CEOs with throughput
functional backgrounds may be less likely to fully
capitalize on the beneﬁts of international assignment
experience because their functional background does
not generally consider the demands of external
stakeholders. Thus, we hypothesize:

H3a: CEO functional background will moderate
the relationship between CEO international
experience and CSP strengths, such that the
positive relationship between CEO interna-
tional experience and CSP strengths will be
stronger for CEOs with output functional
backgrounds.

H3b: CEO functional background will moderate
the relationship between CEO international
experience and CSP weaknesses, such that the
negative relationship between CEO interna-
tional experience and CSP weaknesses will be
more negative for CEOs with output func-
tional backgrounds.

H3c: CEO functional background will moderate the
relationship
between CEO international
experience and total CSP, such that the positive
relationship
between CEO international
experience and total CSP will be stronger for
CEOs with output functional backgrounds.

with a large and growing body of CSP research
(Agle et al., 1999; Berman et al., 1999; Coombs and
Gilley, 2005; Graves and Waddock, 1994; Hillman
and Keim, 2001;

McWilliams and Siegel, 2000; Sharfman, 1996;
Turban and Greening, 1996; Waddock and Graves,

social performance data from KLD Research and
Analytics Inc., an independent investment research
ﬁrm specializing in ﬁrm ratings of environment,
social, and governance performance for use in
investment decisions. KLD provides multiple CSP
indicators across multiple dimensions of CSP to be
discussed further below. The data from these three
independent sources were merged and analyzed for
tests of this study’s hypotheses.

Sample

Our initial sample comprised U.S. CEOs from the
S&P 500 in 2004 – totaling 502 CEOs (two com-
panies were lead by dual CEOs). The CSP measures
for this study are based on annual data from 2004 so
we excluded cases where the CEO was not in ofﬁce
as of January 1st, 2004 (76 CEOs). Therefore, all
CEOs evaluated had tenure as CEO for at least one
year and were thus in a position to inﬂuence the
CSP of their ﬁrm in the target year. Thirty-three
cases were also eliminated from the study due to
missing data leaving a ﬁnal sample size of 393. The
ﬁnal
sample mean age = 56 (SD = 6.8), mean
company tenure = 18.7 (SD = 11.5), and mean

spent

Output functional background
As introduced by Hambrick and Mason (1984),
executive functional backgrounds have often been
categorized as output (e.g., marketing, sales, product
research, and development) and throughput (e.g.,
production, process engineering, and ﬁnance). Prior
research has often used this classiﬁcation to measure
executives’ functional background (Herman, 2002;
Hermann and Datta, 2005; Thomas and Simerly,
1994). Similarly, we categorized CEO functional
background as either output (1) or throughput (0).3

Corporate social performance
We measured corporate social performance using the
dimensions of community, diversity, employee
relations, environmental impact, and product safety
and quality4 because these categories best reﬂect the
stakeholder orientation of CSP (Agle et al., 1999). In
addition, these categories are most common in extant
CSP research (Berman et al., 1999; Coombs and
Gilley, 2005), thus providing a bases for comparison.
Consistent with Mahoney and Thorn (2006), we
strengths,
operationalized CSP in three forms,
rated
weaknesses, and total CSP. Each ﬁrm is
between 0 and 2 on strength and on weakness in each
of the ﬁve dimensions referenced above.5 A score of
2 indicates a major strength or weakness, a score of 1
indicates a notable strength or weakness and a score
of 0 indicates neutral strength or weakness. Strength
and weakness scores are then separately summed
across all ﬁve dimensions to provide indices for

strengths and weaknesses, respectively. This calcula-
tion of CSP strengths and weaknesses is consistent
with previous operationalizations of CSP (Mahoney
and Thorn, 2006;6 McGuire et al., 2003).

The total CSP measure was also created following
prior use of the KLD index (Agle et al., 1999;
Hillman and Keim, 2001; Turban and Greening,
1996; Waddock and Graves, 1997). The total CSP
measure represents net CSP by subtracting the
weakness score from the strength score. Thus, scores
within each stakeholder group can range from -2 to
2. A score of -2 represents a major weakness, -1
represents a notable weakness, 0 represents neutrality
within the category, 1 represents a notable strength,
and 2 represents a major strength. The net or total
CSP scores for each stakeholder group are then
summed to create the total CSP measure.

Control measures

Industry
Industry has been shown to have signiﬁcant effects on
ratings of corporate social performance (Waddock
and Graves, 1997). We controlled for industry by
adjusting all three forms of the dependent variable
(strengths, weaknesses and total CSP) based on
industry averages at the 2 digit level SIC code.
Consistent with Waldman et al. (2006) the industry
average was subtracted from the ﬁrm score to rep-
resent an industry adjusted value.7

Firm size
Firm size has been found to be related to CSP (Graves
and Waddock, 1994). Therefore, we controlled for
ﬁrm size using the natural log of sales for each ﬁrm.

Firm performance
Prior ﬁrm performance has been found to predict CSP
(Waddock and Graves, 1997). We controlled for prior
ﬁrm performance using a 3-year lagged (2001–2003)
average of return on assets for each ﬁrm.

Firm R&D intensity
Prior research has also shown that ﬁrm investment
in R&D is
related to CSP (McWilliams and
Siegel, 2000; Waldman et al., 2006). Therefore, we
controlled for R&D intensity consistent with prior
research using the ratio of R&D expenses to sales.

Firm internationalization
Firm internationalization reﬂects the degree to which
a company engages in international business activity
such as foreign sales and reliance on foreign produc-
tion. Carpenter et al. (2001) found ﬁrm internation-
alization to be related to CEO international
experience which presents a potential confound for
the present study. We controlled for ﬁrm interna-
tionalization using a variation of the Carpenter et al.
(2001) measure – the sum of two ratios, foreign sales to
total sales and foreign assets to total assets.

Age and CEO tenure
Due to their potential inﬂuence on ﬁrm outcomes
(Hambrick and Mason, 1984), CEO age and tenure
(as CEO) were used as control variables in all analyses.

Results

Descriptive statistics and correlations are reported in
Table I.8 Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical
regression analysis. Each of the three CSP indices was
regressed on three hierarchical models. Model 1 in
Tables II, III, and IV contains coefﬁcients and model
results for all control variables. Model 2 adds CEO
international assignment experience and output func-
tional background to assess their incremental effects on
CSP, thus testing hypotheses 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, and 2c.
Model 3 adds the interaction between CEO interna-
tional assignment experience and CEO output func-
tional background as a test of hypotheses 3a, 3b, and 3c.9

Corporate social performance strengths

The results of our hierarchical regression analysis using
the CSP strengths measure are presented in Table II.
Among the control variables included in model 1, we
ﬁnd that ﬁrm size (p < 0.01), ﬁrm R&D intensity
(p < 0.01), and CEO age (p < 0.01) are signiﬁcant
positive predictors of CSP strength. In total, the
control variables account for 26.6% of the variance in
the strengths measure (F = 24.698; p < 0.01). Model
2 shows that CEO international assignment experi-
ence is a signiﬁcant positive predictor of CSP strengths
(p < 0.01), supporting hypothesis 1a. CEO output
functional background was not a signiﬁcant predictor
of CSP strengths (p > 0.05), thus we ﬁnd no support
for hypothesis 2a. Model 3 indicates that the interac-

tion between CEO international assignment experi-
ence and CEO output functional background is a
signiﬁcant positive predictor of CSP strengths
(p < 0.01) supporting hypothesis 3a.

Corporate social performance weaknesses

The results of our hierarchical regression analysis using
the CSP weaknesses measure are presented in
Table III. Among the control variables included in
model 1, we ﬁnd that ﬁrm size (p < 0.01) is a signif-
icant positive predictor, while ﬁrm performance
(p < 0.01) and CEO tenure (p < 0.01) are signiﬁcant
negative predictors of CSP weaknesses. In total, the
control variables account for 30% of the variance in
the weaknesses measure (F = 29.008; p < 0.01).
Models 2 and 3 show that neither CEO international
experience (p > 0.05), CEO output
functional
background (p > 0.05), nor the interaction between
CEO international assignment experience and CEO
output functional background (p > 0.05) are signiﬁ-
cant predictors of CSP weaknesses. Thus, hypothesis
1b, 2b, and 3b are not supported.

Total corporate social performance

The results of our hierarchical regression analysis using
the total CSP measure are presented in Table IV.10
Among the control variables included in model 1, we
ﬁnd that ﬁrm performance (p < 0.01) and ﬁrm R&D
intensity (p < 0.01) are signiﬁcant positive predictors
of total CSP. The control variables account for 6.4% of
the variance in the total CSP measure (F = 5.496;
p < 0.01). Model 2 shows that CEO international
assignment experience is a signiﬁcant positive pre-
dictor of total CSP (p < 0.05), supporting hypothesis
1c. CEO output functional background is a signiﬁcant
positive predictor of total CSP (p < 0.05), supporting
hypothesis 2c. Model 3 indicates that the interaction
between CEO international assignment experience
and CEO output functional background is also a sig-
niﬁcant positive predictor of total CSP (p < 0.05)
supporting hypothesis 3c.

The lack of any signiﬁcant

for our
hypothesized relationships with CSP weaknesses
may reﬂect what previous research has already noted.
McGuire et al. (2003) suggested that the variables
that encourage strong CSP may differ from those
that discourage weak CSP. That is, perhaps CEO
international experience is able to inﬂuence positive
proactive CSP initiatives, but has no effect on the
risky or avoidance approaches to CSP. An alterna-
tive perspective is offered by Maignan and Ralston
(2002) who suggest that CSP represents a ﬁrm’s
attempts to maximize their positive impacts and
minimize their negative impacts on stakeholders.
Thus, our
for CEO

strengths and lack of results for weaknesses may
indicate that CEO international experience is able to
help a ﬁrm maximize their positive impacts, but
unable to help minimize the negative impacts on
stakeholders. If so, these results may also point to an

the CEO’s
inﬂuence is limited to what we conceptualize as CSP

examine where the power lies in inﬂuencing CSP
weaknesses (e.g., top management team, board of
directors, etc.).

Implications

Our study has implications for both management
research and practice. In contributing to manage-
ment theory, our results highlight the importance of
including CEO characteristics in models predicting
CSP. Our examination of two such characteristics,
international assignment experience and functional
background, is a positive step toward answering the
call
for research on speciﬁc managerial variables
relevant to CSP (Thomas and Simerly, 1994; Wood,
1991). In the future, CSP researchers may seek to
explore additional CEO and executive characteris-
tics related to CSP. In addition, we add to the
growing body of
literature examining executive
international assignment experience and provide an

additional outcome variable at both the ﬁrm and
societal levels.

The results of this research also carry implications
for management practice. Given the potential repu-
tational and resource-based beneﬁts of CSP (i.e.,
Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998; Turban and Green-
ing, 1996; Valentine and Fleischman, 2008), along
with the ever increasing pressure to manage both
proﬁts and broader social responsibilities, (Waddock
and Graves, 1997), ﬁrms may recognize the impor-
tance of increasing CSP. In regards to CEO succes-
sion planning, our results suggest that ﬁrms seeking to
positively inﬂuence CSP may use international
assignment experience as one (of many) selection
criteria. Likewise, when grooming a potential inside
successor, ﬁrms may consider sending the executive
on an international assignment as part of their pro-
fessional development. This experience may prove
especially beneﬁcial when a future CEO has an
output functional background. Interestingly, results
of post hoc analysis examining the location of the
CEO’s international experience revealed no signiﬁ-
cant difference in terms of outcomes on CSP. In
other words, it appears that it is the experience of
living and working abroad itself, and not the speciﬁc
location, that matters.

Limitations and future research

Our study is not without limitations. Drawing from
theoretical and empirical work on upper echelons and
international experience outcomes, we have sug-
gested that CEO international assignment experience
will inﬂuence ﬁrm CSP. However, our approach was
cross-sectional in nature. Thus, the question of causal
direction should be further explored. Beyond causal
direction, the possibility exists that a third variable
could account for the discovered relationship. For
example, perhaps CEOs who are willing to accept
international assignments also possess some individual
trait which predisposes them toward CSP initiatives.
In our own arguments we suggest that international
assignment experience will
inﬂuence the CEOs
awareness of societal expectations, motivation toward
societal action, and unique abilities. However, we
were unable to directly test these implied micro-
processes.

regarding international assignment
inﬂuences and
shed additional light on our ﬁndings. In spite of this
limitation, upper echelons research supports the use of
demographic characteristics (i.e., unobtrusive mea-
sures) as proxies for underlying individual differences,
values, and cognitive frameworks (Hambrick, 2007;
Hambrick and Mason, 1984).

Future research may also address the potential for
other avenues of international exposure that may
inﬂuence CSP. Perhaps being born in another
country or having signiﬁcant exposure to another
culture would have many of the same effects as
international assignments. In undertaking this study,
we had considered the possible inﬂuence of other
cultural experiences, yet, less than 3% of the CEOs
sample were foreign-born.11 Although
in our
increasing in numbers, the CEOs of large ﬁrms in
the U.S. are still relatively homogeneous in terms of
racial background, ethnicity, and gender. As the
demographic diversity of U.S. executives becomes
more heterogeneous, future research may be able to
explore the possible inﬂuences of demographic dif-
ferences such as foreign-born executives.

This research was also limited to evaluation of the
CEO. Upper echelons researchers have noted that
more research considering the entire top manage-
ment team is needed (Hambrick, 2007). Even be-
yond the top management team, future research may
also seek to evaluate the inﬂuence of international
experience for the board of directors, middle man-
agement, or other organizational members.

Conclusion

The ﬁndings of this study make contributions to
existing knowledge in three areas. First, consistent
with upper echelons research, the results of this study
further indicate the ability of executives to inﬂuence
important ﬁrm outcomes. Second, this research also
extends previous understanding of
international
experience. Previous research indicates that inter-
national assignment experience provides individual
level outcomes
salaries; Carpenter
et al., 2001) and ﬁrm level outcomes (e.g., increased
ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance; Daily et al., 2000). The
ﬁndings presented in this research introduce a soci-
etal
level outcome – enhanced CSP. Finally, as
indicated at the outset of this study, understanding

(e.g., greater

the antecedents to CSP has important outcomes for
both ﬁrms and society at large. The ﬁndings of this
study contribute to our growing understanding of
CSP by indicating that a CEO who has spent time
on international assignments may be more motivated
and better equipped to meet the expectations of
societal stakeholders.

Notes

1 Many of the experiences of studying abroad over-
lap with international assignment experience including,
uprooting of an existing life, separation from the famil-
iar, and exposure to a different culture. In addition, the
outcomes of study abroad experience and international
assignment experience are very similar, including long-
lasting impact (Carpenter et al., 2000; Dwyer, 2004),
greater
(Kauffman
et al., 1992; Ricks et al., 1990), and an inﬂuence on
personal values (Chieffo and Grifﬁths, 2004; Suutari and
Makela, 2007). Based on these ﬁndings, we use study
abroad experience to support our arguments on the
inﬂuence of international assignment experience.

marketing, product R&D, ﬁnance, etc.). In order to
measure output and throughput functional backgrounds
consistent with prior conceptualizations (Herman, 2002;
Hermann and Datta, 2005; Thomas and Simerly, 1994),
the authors independently categorized each executive in
our sample as either an output functional background (1)
or a throughput functional background (0). Inter-rater
reliability was a = 0.91. The leading cause of the few
discrepancies between ratings was due to some CEOs
having multiple cross-categorical functional backgrounds.
In such cases, the CEO was categorized based on their
most recent functional experience.

for Canadian ﬁrms as their measure for CSP. However,
their scoring of strengths and weakness for each dimen-
sion (0–2) is consistent with that used in this study.

7

Industry averages were calculated using all ﬁrms

rated by KLD in 2004 (3034 ﬁrms).

8

Small means for CSP measures are the result of the
method used to control for industry. Industry averages
were subtracted from each ﬁrm score resulting in an
industry adjusted value.

9 The interaction term was created using mean cen-
tered CEO international experience and CEO output
functional background.
10 As prior research suggests, CSP strengths and weak-
nesses may not be orthogonal (Mahoney and Thorn,
2006; McGuire et al., 2003; Strike et al., 2006). Note the
signiﬁcant positive correlation (0.27; p < 0.01) between
CSP strengths and weaknesses reported in Table I. The
nature of
the association between the strengths and
weaknesses is also evidenced by the reduced adjusted
R2 s for the total CSP measure (0.064–0.092) compared
to those of CSP strengths (0.266–0.296) and weaknesses
(0.300–0.303). Further
the association
between strengths and weaknesses can be seen by exam-
ining the signiﬁcant positive correlations between ﬁrm
size and CSP strengths (0.42; p < 0.01) and CSP weak-
nesses (0.50; p < 0.01). In addition, ﬁrm size is a signiﬁ-
cant positive predictor
for both CSP strengths and
weaknesses in all models in Tables II and III (p < 0.01).
This ﬁnding could be interpreted that large ﬁrms are
more scrutinized by CSP raters and thus receive more
positive and negative ratings. Taken together, this data
would support the notion that ﬁrms may exhibit CSP

indications of

strengths and weaknesses simultaneously and by aggregat-
ing strengths and weaknesses
(subtracting weaknesses
from strengths) variance is reduced.
11 We removed these 11 CEOs from our sample and
re-ran our hierarchical regression analysis on all three
forms of
the dependent variable. The results were
unchanged in each case.
