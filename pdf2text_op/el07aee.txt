ABSTRACT
This study analyzes the effect of pollution control on corporate ﬁnancial performance
in a transition economy. In particular, it assesses whether better pollution control, as
measured  by  lower  air  pollutant  emissions,  improves  or  undermines  ﬁnancial
success,  as  captured  by  accounting-based  measures  of  ﬁnancial  performance,  e.g.
proﬁtability. For this assessment, this study analyzes the effect of air pollution control
using a panel of Czech ﬁrms for the years 1996–1998. The analytical results indicate
that  better  pollution  control  neither  improves  nor  undermines  ﬁnancial  success.
These  results  provide  no  support  for  the  hypothesis  that  pollution  prevention, 
generated by improved production processes, led to lower costs, and thus, greater
proﬁtability. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Introduction

THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE ENDURED HEAVILY DEGRADED ENVIRONMENTS

during the latter years of their communist regimes. Even though current pollution levels in these
countries remain above levels in the countries of Western Europe, the reduction in pollution,
especially air pollutant emissions, is remarkable. In general, current air pollution levels repre-
sent only a small fraction of the their peak levels under communist rule; for example, sulfur dioxide
(SO2) emissions and particulate matter emissions have fallen to levels that are 10 and 5%, respectively,
of their peak levels. In the transition economy of the Czech Republic, during the years between 1991
and 1998, tighter air protection policies on firm-level air pollutant emissions represent the most likely
cause of this country’s dramatic decline in air pollutant levels. Our study does not attempt to confirm
this  conjecture.  Instead,  we  rely  upon  the  findings  of  Earnhart  and  Lizal  (2006b),  who  provide

sufficient evidence of the connection from tighter air protection policies in the Czech Republic to lower
air pollutant emissions during the early years of its economic transition: 1993–1998.

Certainly,  the  extent  of  the  increased  stringency  of  air  pollution  control  policies  seems  readily  ap-
parent. In anticipation of the Czech Republic’s entrance into the European Union (EU), between 1991
and 1998, the country’s government was tightening air protection with a new Clean Air Act and its sub-
sequent clarifying decrees. In particular, the Czech government was requiring new stationary emission
sources  to  meet  stringent  performance-based  emission  limits  (levels  of  which  were  identified  by  the
installation and operation of state-of-the-art treatment technologies) and forcing existing stationary emis-
sion sources initially to meet ‘currently attainable’ emission limits and eventually to meet new source
limits (by the end of 1998), all while steadily increasing emission charge rates on all stationary emis-
sion  sources.  Consistent  with  these  escalating  policies,  investment  in  environmental  protection  as  a
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) rose dramatically after 1991, peaking in 1997, and declined
substantially after 1998, returning to pre-transition levels by 2000. Throughout this same period, aggre-
gate air pollutant emissions declined dramatically.

Based  on  the  reasonable  assumption  that  tighter  air  pollution  control  policies  at  least  partially
prompted firms to reduce dramatically their air pollutant emissions, our study assesses whether better
firm-level air pollution control, as measured by lower air pollutant emissions, affects corporate finan-
cial performance. In essence, our study asks whether tighter air protection policies hamper or help a
firm’s financial performance or possibly have no effect on performance. To answer this question, we
consider  measures  of  accounting-based  financial  performance,  e.g.  profitability.  For  this  assessment,
our  study  analyzes  the  effect  of  air  pollution  control  using  a  panel  of  Czech  firms  for  the  years
1996–1998.

Of course, the context of the Czech transition economy is also highly interesting for an assessment
of financial performance. Firms in this transition economy were struggling to restructure themselves
within a new market-based system. De novo private firms struggled to establish themselves as the eco-
nomic system evolved. State-owned firms struggled to compete against potentially more nimble private
competitors.  Privatized  firms  faced  the  extra  challenge  of  reformulating  their  corporate  management
practices to fit an entirely new economic paradigm. The importance of corporate restructuring and finan-
cial management was even greater in the Czech Republic, given its potential and eventual accession into
the EU, as was true for several of the transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe during the
period 1996–1998.

Consequently,  Czech  firms  simultaneously  struggled  to  control  their  air  pollutant  emissions  and
restructure  their  financial  matters.  Did  better  pollution  control  management  seem  to  help  or  hinder
Czech firms’ efforts to restructure their financial matters? Our study attempts to answer this question.
While the Czech Republic serves as an excellent study site for the reasons expressed above, (1) tighter
air  protection  policies,  (2)  air  pollution  reductions  and  (3)  financial  restructuring,  this  country  is  cer-
tainly not unique. Other transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe also tightened their air pro-
tection policies and experienced substantial reductions in air pollutant emissions prior to their ascension
into the European Union. Similarly, firms in other Central and Eastern European countries also strug-
gled to restructure their financial matters. Therefore, our study of the Czech Republic may be viewed
as representative of several countries in the Central and Eastern European region during its transition
period towards EU accession. Of course, the transitional experiences of other Central and Eastern Euro-
pean countries definitely differ from the Czech transitional experience in meaningful ways, so our study
may reflect only the single country’s experience.1

and Eastern Europe.

Related Literature and Theoretical Insight

Literature of the Link from Environmental Performance to Financial Success

To  guide  our  analysis  on  the  effect  of  firm-level  air  pollution  control  efforts  on  corporate  financial 
performance, we draw upon previous studies that explore the link from corporate environmental per-
formance  to  financial  performance.  Fortunately,  much  recent  analysis,  including  empirical  studies,
examines the effect of corporate environmental performance on financial performance (e.g. Konar and
Cohen, 2001; Filbeck and Gorman, 2004). Theoretical insight on this topic posits either a positive rela-
tionship  or  a  negative  relationship.  The  traditional  perspective  views  environmental  expenditures,
whether on end-of-pipe treatment or pollution prevention efforts, as a drain on firms’ resources (see,
e.g., Palmer et al., 1995). Certainly, firms spend much money when applying for environmental permits,
installing mandatory technologies or at least technologies necessary to achieve compliance with pollu-
tion limits, and reporting their environmental impacts (Portney and Stavins, 2000). On the other hand,
more recent theoretical insight posits that firms are able to adopt riskier proactive environmental man-
agement  practices  that  attempt  to  modify  existing  production  processes  or  install  new  productions
processes in order to prevent pollution rather than treat it. While riskier, these pollution prevention pro-
grams may effectively reduce pollution, while also lowering costs (Filbeck and Gorman, 2004). Simi-
larly, the reduction of pollution through pollution prevention or end-of-pipe treatment may allow firms
to increase their sales base by marketing ‘green’ products (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996). Consistent
with this perspective, firms in various countries are moving beyond compliance by voluntarily reducing
their pollution to levels below legal limits (Konar and Cohen, 2001). In some cases, this overcompliance
is associated with a government-sponsored voluntary program. For example, many European firms par-
ticipate  in  the  Eco-Management  and  Audit  Scheme  (EMAS)  program,  which  represents  an  environ-
mental management systems standard provided by the European Union. Even government mandatory
programs that impose more stringent requirements may prompt firms to innovate, which translates into
a  competitive  advantage  for  firms  (Porter  and  van  der  Linde,  1995).  Whether  representing  voluntary
overcompliance  or  compliance  with  more  stringent  government  requirements,  lower  pollution  levels
may  reduce  financing  costs  because  lenders  and  investors  associate  lower  financial  risk  with  better 
environmental  management  (McGuire  et  al.,  1988).  Similarly,  it  may  lower  the  costs  associated  with 
possible future third-party lawsuits (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996).

While various reasons may exist for explaining any possible link from pollution control to financial
performance, we are able to identify a single defensible hypothesis. We posit that the modification of
existing  production  processes  or  introduction  of  new  production  processes  may  have  allowed  Czech
firms to lower both emissions and costs, leading to a positive link from better air pollution control to
stronger financial performance. These opportunities were prevalent in the Czech Republic during its
transition period. In many cases, Czech firms were able to invest in more efficient production processes
that  were  also  environmentally  friendly,  i.e.,  the  new  production  processes  required  less  energy, 
generated less waste, demanded fewer toxic inputs etc.

The other possible reasons for a positive link between pollution control and financial performance
seem insufficiently relevant for the Czech transition period. Specifically, Czech firms were probably not
well situated during the sample period to deliver ‘green’ products.2 Similarly, the conjecture that better

2 According to Czech Ministry of Environment (2004), while the Czech Ministry of the Environment established the National Eco-Labeling
Program in 1994, this program operated at a low level prior to 2000. Starting in 2000, the Czech government began to support the sale of
eco-labeled products by granting them preference in the purchasing orders from the state administration. In the same year, the national program
entered  the  Global  Eco-Labeling  Network.  By  2004,  the  program  had  awarded  the  eco-label  to  310  products,  involving  169  licenses  for  82 
companies; moreover, the Czech government had integrated its national program into the multinational programs of the OECD and EU.

pollution control lowers financing costs is not plausible for the Czech Republic during the sample period
given the lack of any corroborating evidence. Last, the threat of third-party lawsuits was trivial in the
Czech Republic during this period (Earnhart, 1998).

Consistent  with  this  assessment,  we  wish  to  test  empirically  the  hypothesis  that  better  production
technologies led to pollution prevention, which establishes a positive link from better pollution control
to stronger financial performance. This hypothesis is especially relevant for a transition economy. Given
the  legacy  of  the  preceding  central  planned  systems  in  place  before  1990,  many  firms  were  in  a 
position  to  prevent  pollution  by  modifying  or  replacing  their  production  processes.  This  transition
context  contrasts  with  a  mature  market  economy,  where  most  firms  may  only  marginally  modify 
their  environmental  management  practices  with  only  limited  effects  on  their  financial  performance. 
(Of  course,  many  prominent  cases  of  substantial  change  to  environmental  management  do  exist  in
mature  market  economies;  however,  these  cases  need  not  represent  a  substantial  portion  of  the 
overall economy.)

To place our empirical analysis in context, we briefly summarize recent empirical studies that explore

the link from corporate environmental performance to financial performance.

Some previous studies employ multivariate regression analysis to explore the link from environmen-
tal performance to financial performance. First, Konar and Cohen (2001) find a significantly positive
effect of environmental performance, as measured by toxic emissions, on firms’ intangible asset values.
Hart  and  Ahuja  (1996)  estimate  the  effect  of  emission  reductions  on  accounting-based  measures  of
financial  performance.  They  conclude  that  emission  reductions  prompt  better  financial  performance
within  a  two-year  window.  As  additional  studies,  Russo  and  Fouts  (1997)  examine  the  effect  of  envi-
ronmental ratings on a firm’s return on assets, Khanna and Damon (1999) evaluate the connection from
environmental to financial performance for participants in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s
33/50 program, and Arora and Cason (1996) evaluate the financial performance of 33/50 participants
and show that participation slightly increases profits.

In addition, four studies use sample means tests to examine the effect of environmental performance
on  financial  performance  in  standard  market  economies.  First,  Cohen  et  al. (1997)  examine  both
accounting-based measures of financial performance (e.g. return on assets) and market-based measures
of financial performance (e.g. risk-adjusted shareholder total return). Their study divides a sample of
US firms into two ‘portfolios’ according to whether each firm is above or below its industry median for
one of nine environmental performance measures. Then they test the differences in financial perfor-
mance  mean  values  across  the  two  sub-samples.  Second,  Gottsman  and  Kessler  (1998)  compare  the
financial returns to the S&P 500 against three sub-samples based on four measures of environmental
performance. In particular, they divide firms into the top 75%, top 50% and top 25% of environmental
performers. Third, Austin et al. (1999) divide firms into ‘green’ and ‘brown’ categories according to their
environmental performance, similar to Cohen et al. (1997). Fourth, Filbeck and Gorman (2004) divide
their sample of electric company firms into two portions – a ‘less compliant’ portfolio and a ‘more com-
pliant’ portfolio – based on the magnitudes of imposed environmental penalties, and then test whether
monthly total stockholder returns differ between these two portfolios.

Our  study  draws  upon  this  empirical  literature  to  guide  our  analysis.  Since  all  of  the  noted 
studies  examine  mature  market  economies,  our  study  contributes  to  the  literature  by  examining 
the  link  from  corporate  environmental  performance  to  financial  performance  in  a  transition 
economy.3

3 The  only  previous  study  of  environmental  and  financial  performance  in  a  transition  economy  –  Earnhart  and  Lizal  (2006a)  –  examines 
the effect of preceding financial performance on current environmental performance. In contrast, the current study examines the effect of 
preceding environmental performance on current financial performance.

Literature on Financial Performance in Central and Eastern Europe

We  also  draw  upon  recent  economic  studies  of  corporate  financial  performance  in  the  transition
economies of Central and Eastern Europe. None of these studies consider environmental performance
as an explanatory variable. Moreover, the prominent economic studies use a surprisingly narrow set of
measures to capture corporate financial performance. In particular, they consider only accounting-based
measures of financial performance. In contrast to studies of financial performance in mature market
economies, few studies of the Central and Eastern European region consider market-based measures
for examining corporate-level financial performance across a variety of firms; this limited use is not sur-
prising given the weakly developed state of most of the stock markets in this region during the 1990s.
This focus on accounting-based measures of financial performance is not limiting since these measures
serve as the most important predictors of market-based financial performance.

The recent studies of the transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe use a variety of mea-
sures for capturing corporate financial performance. Frydman et al. (1999) use sales revenues and labor
and material costs (relative to revenues). Claessens and Djankov (1999) use profitability, based on oper-
ating profits divided by the sum of fixed assets and inventory, in which this sum represents an alterna-
tive  to  total  assets.  Weiss  and  Nikitin  (2002)  use  operating  profit  and  value  added  on  either  a  per 
worker  basis  or  a  per  capital  unit  basis;  in  these  calculations,  they  use  depreciation  as  a  proxy  for 
the  number  of  capital  units.  Hanousek  et  al. (2005)  use  sales,  labor  costs  and  profitability,  based  on
operating  profits  relative  to  either  sales  or  total  assets.  Pohl  et  al. (1997)  use  profitability.  We  utilize 
these studies to identify meaningful measures of corporate financial performance in the context of a
transition economy.

We also utilize these studies to identify control factors in the context of a transition economy. All of
these cited studies include only three types of control factor: ownership structure, year indicators and
industrial sector indicators. Multi-country studies also include country-specific indicators (e.g. Frydman
et al., 1999). We include the same relevant control factors as these cited studies, in addition to other
factors; we describe below the included control factors.

Data on Financial and Environmental Performance

Czech Republic as Study Site

To examine the effect of air pollution control on corporate financial performance, we exploit data on
firms in the Czech Republic between 1996 and 1998, which is an excellent site and time period for our
study. First, the Czech Republic had a substantially degraded environment; in particular, poor ambient
air quality and air pollution were large environmental problems of public concern in the Czech Repub-
lic  (World  Bank,  1992).  In  response  to  public  concern,  the  Czech  Republic’s  government  authorities
took substantial and effective steps to decrease air emissions dramatically during the period 1991–1998
(Czech Ministry of Environment, 1998). Figure 1 displays the trend of economy-wide air emissions over
this period. Perhaps the post-communist decline in economic activity partially explains the drop in the
early 1990s. This output decline notwithstanding, firms’ pollution control efforts, such as the installa-
tion of electrostatic precipitators (‘scrubbers’) and fuel switching, may also explain much of the reduc-
tion  in  air  pollutant  emissions  (World  Bank,  1999).  Second,  consistent  with  this  focus  on  pollution
control efforts, investment in environmental protection was most important during the period between
1992 and 1998, as shown in Figure 2. As a percentage of Czech gross domestic product (GDP), invest-
ment rose dramatically after 1991 from a level of 1.3% to a peak of 2.5% in 1997 and tailed off after 1998
back to a pre-transition level of 1.1% by 2000; in 1990, investment was 1.1% of GDP. Third, the Czech

Republic  was  attempting  to  enter  the  European  Union  (EU)  during  this  period  and  was  required  to
reduce its industrial emissions in order to qualify for membership.4

Panel Data from Financial Statements and Emissions Register

To  examine  accounting-based  financial  performance  at  Czech  enterprises,  we  gather  data  from  three
segments of a database provided by the private data vendor Aspekt. One segment provides information
drawn from firms’ balance sheets, such as assets, and another segment provides information taken from
firms’ income statements, such as profits. (Since the analysis incorporates year indicators into the regres-
sion analysis, these financial data are not adjusted for inflation. This approach avoids the need to utilize
a potentially biased inflation deflator, especially in the years of fast economic adjustment, as discussed
by Filer and Hanousek (2004a, 2004b).) The third segment provides information on ownership struc-
ture, which we use as a control variable in our multivariate regression analysis. We gather balance sheet,
income statement and ownership data for the years 1996–1998. The Aspekt database includes all firms
traded on the primary market – Prague Stock Exchange – or secondary market, and a majority of the
remaining large Czech firms (plus their key trading partners). This comprehensive database has been
used by previous studies of financial performance in the Czech Republic (e.g., Claessens and Djankov,

1999; Weiss and Nikitin, 2002; Kocenda and Svejnar, 2002; Djankov, 1999). Last, we acknowledge that
accounting data are potentially biased and distorted due to accounting techniques; however, we claim
that the potential for bias and distortion is not serious in this case.

To measure firm-level pollution control management, we gather information on air pollutants emitted
by facilities located in the Czech Republic during the years 1995 and 1998. (We gather information on
air pollutant emissions for the additional year of 1995 because our regression analysis lags the measure
of  air  pollution  by  one  year,  as  explained  below)  The  included  pollutants  are  carbon  monoxide  (CO),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter and nitrous oxides (NOx), which represent the main and most
heavily regulated pollutants in the Czech Republic, similar to other industrialized nations. The Czech
Hydrometeorological Institute maintains the REZZO-1 database, which records emissions for large, sta-
tionary sources. While the REZZO-1 database records emissions at individual units of individual facili-
ties, the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute aggregated the air emissions to the level of each facility
before release of the data. We further aggregate air emissions across all facilities associated with a single
firm since the other data are available only at the firm level. Thus, the analysis links emission data aggre-
gated  to  the  firm  level  with  other  firm-level  data,  consistent  with  previous  studies  of  firm-level  envi-
ronmental performance (Konar and Cohen, 1997, 2001; Earnhart and Lizal, 2006a; Khanna and Damon,
1999; Khanna et al., 1998; Arora and Cason, 1995). Finally, we add the four pollutants into one com-
posite measure of air emissions, similar to previous studies of environmental performance (Konar and
Cohen, 1997, 2001; Khanna and Damon, 1999; Khanna et al., 1998; Arora and Cason, 1995, 1996).

To examine the effect of air pollutant emissions on financial performance, we merge the financial, own-
ership and emission data sets. In order to generate the largest sample possible and to avoid a sample selec-
tion bias due to attrition, we create an unbalanced panel of firm-year observations for the time period
1996–1998. In this merger and creation, we screen for meaningful financial data by applying the fol-
lowing criteria: positive production (measured in Czech Crowns), positive total assets and positive fixed
assets. Other important financial measures, such as profits, are difficult to screen because they can truth-
fully take zero or negative values. We also restrict our sample to those observations with non-missing data
for the financial, ownership and emission variables used in our analysis. We consider two financial per-
formance measures: profits and operating profits; each retained observation must possess non-missing
data for both measures. We choose not to examine two different samples based on the availability of data
for each financial performance measure; by considering a single sample, we avoid sample compositional
biases when comparing results across the two financial performance measures. The same concern applies
to our use of various measures of firm size: total assets, equity and sales; again, we avoid compositional
biases by considering a single sample. This merger, screening and set of restrictions generates a com-
bined unbalanced panel of 436 firms with 1063 observations for the years 1996–1998. (In this process,
missing values, not inconsistent values, cause most of the reduction in sample size.)5

Descriptive Statistics

Tables  1–6  present  a  statistical  summary  of  the  relevant  firm  data.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  our  data 
are sufficiently spread across the three years of our time frame. Table 2 summarizes our data on air
emissions. Our data set contains much variation for emissions, which facilitates our analysis.

5 The restriction of non-missing data binds strongly for ownership data because we lack these data for many firm–year observations. (Owner-
ship data for years prior to 1996 are especially scarce and practically absent prior to 1995, which explains our focus on the period 1996–1998.
In addition, data on ownership prior to 1996 mostly exist for firms that were privatized under the Czech citizen voucher program; thus, use
of these data most likely would introduce sample selection bias.) The incomplete recording of ownership data during the chosen sample period
raises a concern about selection bias. We address this concern by implementing a Heckman two-step sample selection procedure (Heckman,
1979).  Based  on  the  first  stage  of  this  procedure,  we  generate  an  inverse  Mills  ratio  for  each  firm  in  each  time  period.  By  including  this 
variable as a regressor in the estimation of financial performance, we control for any potential sample selection bias. (Complete details are
available upon request.)

sent absolute measures of financial performance. The distinction between these two performance mea-
sures is useful. Each measure begins with sales. Gross profits represents the difference between sales
and  costs  of  goods  sold;  we  do  not  study  gross  profits.  Operating  profits  represents  the  difference

gains and taxes. Based on these definitions, no unambiguous ranking exists. Yet, profits most likely are
less than operating income. Table 2 confirms this expected ranking.

Generally, these absolute accounting-based performance measures are transformed into financial rate
of  return  measures  by  scaling  the  absolute  values  with  respect  to  measures  of  firm  size:  total  assets,
equity and sales. Unlike the absolute financial performance measures, the various firm size measures
are difficult to relate since total assets, equity and sales capture distinctively different aspects of a firm’s
financial structure.

By construction, each financial rate of return measure is composed as a ratio between an absolute
measure of financial success, such as profits, and a measure of firm size, such as equity. For example,
the  ratio  of  profits  and  equity  represents  the  return  on  equity,  generally  abbreviated  as  ROE.  These
accounting-based  rate  of  return  measures  are  useful  for  understanding  financial  performance.  For
example, return on assets is a good measure of financial performance because it indicates the efficiency
with which assets are utilized to generate profits (Cohen et al., 1997). Similarly, return on equity indi-
cates the efficiency with which capitalization is utilized to generate profits. Return on sales is a good
measure of financial performance since it indicates how effectively firms are able to translate sales into
profits  (Rassier,  2005).  (Using  rates  of  return  also  mitigates  any  concern  over  the  measurement  of 
inflation.)

Table 3 presents a summary of the financial return measures used in our study, which stem from
either  profits  or  operating  profits.  For  example,  the  following  list  describes  the  profits-based  rates  of
return:

(1) profits relative to assets – return on assets (ROA),
(2) profits relative to equity – return on equity (ROE) – and
(3) profits relative to sales – return on sales (ROS).

Again, our data set contains much variation in the financial return measures.

As an alternative way of summarizing the data on financial performance, Tables 4 and 5 examine the
correlations between the pair of absolute financial performance measures and correlations between pairs
of firm size measures; for both sets, we examine each year of the sample separately. Table 4 tabulates
the first set of correlations. Profits and operating profits are strongly correlated but not overly so, given
a  correlation  coefficient  (ρ)  that  ranges  between  0.68  and  0.85.  Based  on  these  correlations,  these
absolute measures may convey somewhat different information about the financial performance of the
firms in our sample. Consequently, it seems prudent to examine both absolute performance measures.
Table 5 considers the set of correlations involving firm size. Total assets are very strongly correlated
with each of the other two firm size measures, with ρ ≥ 0.92 in all cases. To a lesser extent, equity and
sales are strongly correlated, with ρ ≥ 0.84 in all cases. Based on an overall assessment of these corre-
lations, it does not appear critical that our analysis consider all three measures of firm size. Most likely,
all three measures are capturing similar information about a firm’s size.

Last, Table 6 tabulates the sectoral classifications of the firms included in our sample.

Statistical Analysis of Environmental Performance

Econometric Structure

In this section, we use the described data to explore the link from air pollution control to financial per-
formance, as measured by accounting-based rates of return, at Czech firms in 1996–1998. Similar to
previous  studies  by  Konar  and  Cohen  (2001),  Hart  and  Ahuja  (1996),  Russo  and  Fouts  (1997),  and
Khanna  and  Damon  (1999),  we  employ  multivariate  regression  analysis  to  estimate  this  link.  When
attempting to identify this link, we avoid using the current level of air pollutant emissions, since con-
temporaneous  financial  performance  and  air  pollutant  emissions  are  most  likely  jointly  determined.
Instead,  we  use  lagged  air  pollutant  emissions,  which  are  considered  as  predetermined.  Generally,
lagging  environmental  performance  avoids  any  endogeneity  problem  (Konar  and  Cohen,  2001; 
Cohen  et  al.,  1997;  Austin  et  al.,  1999).  Moreover,  the  lagging  of  environmental  performance  seems
proper since one would expect a lag between any reduction in emissions and any alteration to revenues
and/or costs. In essence, the analysis examines the link from air pollutant emissions to future financial
performance.

To estimate the influence of environmental performance on financial performance, we regress each
type of financial performance on lagged air pollutant emissions plus other control factors. To construct
the econometric models associated with financial performance, we define the following notation. We
consider two sets of dependent variables. As the first set of dependent variables, π
it denotes the profits-
based rate of return – ROA, ROE or ROS – generated by firm i in time period t. As the second set of
dependent variables, oit denotes the operating-profits-based rate of return generated by firm i in time
period t.

We  incorporate  various  explanatory  variables  into  our  estimation  of  profits-  and  operating-profits-
based rates of return. As the primary explanatory variable, pi,t − 1 denotes the amount of pollution emitted
by firm i in the preceding time period t − 1 (i.e. lagged emissions). We also include financially related
factors as explanatory variables. Rates of return may depend on firm size, denoted as ait. In general, firm
size is captured by total assets; however, to estimate rates of return on equity, we instead use equity to
capture firm size. Similarly, rates of return may also depend on total liabilities, denoted as Lit. To esti-
mate rates of return on equity, we replace total liabilities with total debt. (Our results are fully robust to
this replacement.) As two additional financial factors, we incorporate the ratio of sales to total assets,
which measures asset turnover, and the ratio of fixed assets to total assets, which reflects the impor-
tance of physical capital. Collectively, we denote these additional factors as Zit.

Our analysis incorporates additional regressors. Specifically, we include two regressors that capture
ownership structure, consistent with most studies of transition economies. These regressors separately
measure  the  ownership  share  held  by  two  key  investors:  foreign  private  investors  and  the  state.  The
omitted ownership share category includes domestic private investors. Collectively, we denote these own-
ership variables as Wit. To control for variation over time with respect to economy-wide trends and the
legal framework controlling air emissions, we also include individual year indicators, collectively denoted
as vector Tt. To control for sector-specific variation, we also include industry indicator variables, collec-
tively denoted as vector Xi. (The particular sectors are listed in Table 6; the omitted sector is ‘Education,
health  and  veterinary  services;  other  public  and  social  services’.)  The  fixed  effects  model,  described
below, subsumes these sectoral effects into its firm-specific fixed effects since sector does not vary over
time for a specific firm.

Given this notation, we formulate the following regression equations:

separately;  joint  estimation  of  the  two  equations  within  a  seemingly  unrelated  regression  framework
generates identical results since the two regressor sets are the same.

To assess the robustness of our regression results, we estimate Equations (1) and (2) based on various
subsets of the noted regressors.6 One subset includes only the lagged air pollutant emissions factor along
with the year indicators and sectoral indicators: model 1. Another subset additionally incorporates the
two ownership shares and the sales-to-assets ratio: model 2. The full regressor set includes also firm
size, total liabilities or equity and the fixed-to-total assets ratio: model 3. (Our primary conclusion is fully
robust to the use of other regressor subsets.)

To control properly for firm-specific effects, we estimate Equations (1) and (2) using standard panel
methods: pooled OLS, fixed effects method and random effects method. We use standard tests to assess
these methods. When the F-test indicates significant firm-specific effects, the fixed effect estimator dom-
inates  the  pooled  OLS  estimator.  This  dominance  always  holds  for  returns  on  assets  and  returns  on
sales. For these two sets of dependent variables, we only report the F-test statistics (as shown in Tables
7–10) rather than reporting the biased pooled OLS estimates. In the case of returns on equity, the F-test
statistics indicate that the fixed effect estimator does not dominate. Nevertheless, we do not report the
pooled OLS estimates, focusing instead on the random effect estimates, since they appear consistent in
most of the models (see below), and fixed effect estimates, for comparability across the other two depen-
dent variable sets. We use the Hausman test of random effects to evaluate whether the random effect
estimates are consistent. If consistent, the random effect estimator is preferable to the fixed effect esti-
mator. If not consistent, the fixed effect estimator is preferable since it is consistent by assumption. In
general, the random effect estimates are inconsistent based on the Hausman test statistics, as reported
in Tables 7–10. Rather than compare across two different estimators, we primarily focus on the fixed
effect estimates. For returns on equity, we additionally report the random effect estimates, since some
sets of these estimates appear consistent. Fortunately, an assessment of these few random effect esti-
mates reveals the same primary conclusion regarding the link from (lagged) air pollutant emissions to
financial performance as that revealed by the assessment of the fixed effect estimates.

Estimation Results

We estimate two sets of accounting-based return rates: profits based and operating profits based. We
first examine the set of regression results based on profit-based rates of return. These results for ROA,
ROE and ROS are shown in Tables 7, 8 and 9, and 10, respectively. Each table displays the regression
results for models 1, 2 and 3.

We consider initially the profit-based return on assets (ROA). As shown in Table 7, the effect of lagged
pollutant emissions on financial performance is fully robust to the choice of regressor set. Regardless
of the model, the effect of lagged pollutant emissions is highly insignificant. These insignificant results
do  not  appear  to  stem  from  regressions  without  explanatory  power.  As  the  best  example,  model  3 
generates  an  adjusted  R2 of  0.58  and  generates  significant  coefficients  for  the  sales-to-assets  ratio, 
fixed-to-total assets ratio, total assets and total liabilities, along with the two year indicators.

6 Each subset also includes the inverse Mills ratio, as dictated by the Heckman sample selection correction procedure; see footnote 5.

We consider next the profit-based return on sales (ROS). Similar to its effect on ROA, the effect of
lagged pollutant emissions on ROS is fully robust to the choice of regressor set, as shown in Table 10.
Regardless of the model, the effect of lagged pollutant emissions is highly insignificant. Again, these
insignificant  results  do  not  appear  to  stem  from  regressions  without  explanatory  power.  As  the  best
example, model 3 generates an adjusted R2 of 0.64 and generates significant coefficients for the sales-
to-assets ratio, total assets and total liabilities, along with one year indicator.

Last, we consider the profit-based return on equity (ROE). Similar to its effects on ROA and ROS, the
effect of lagged pollutant emissions on ROE is fully robust to the choice of regressor set, as shown in
Tables 8 and 9. Regardless of the model, the effect of lagged pollutant emissions is highly insignificant.
Moreover, the effect on ROE is fully robust to the choice of estimator. Table 8 reports the fixed effect
estimates; Table 9 reports the random effect estimates, including estimates for model 3, which appear
inconsistent based on the Hausman test statistic. Regardless of the estimator, the effect of lagged pol-
lutant emissions is highly insignificant. In contrast to the estimation of ROA and ROS, some of these
insignificant results may stem from regressions with limited explanatory power. The fixed effect esti-
mator certainly displays meaningful explanatory power, as evidenced in model 3, which contains sig-
nificant coefficients for key factors (state ownership, equity and the fixed-to-total assets ratio). However,

the random effect estimator displays minimal explanatory power. As shown in Table 9, the adjusted R2
is 0.02 for each model and none of the displayed coefficients are significant. (Assessment of the pooled
OLS estimates also reveals very low adjusted R2 values and an absence of significant coefficients with
one exception.)

Regardless of the profits-based rate of return estimated and the regressor set or estimator used to esti-
mate the dependent variables, our results indicate that better air pollution control neither improves nor
undermines financial performance. Thus, our estimation results provide no support for the hypothesis
that  pollution  prevention,  generated  by  improved  production  processes,  led  to  lower  costs  and  thus,
greater profitability.

An  assessment  of  the  estimation  results  for  operating  profit-based  return  rates  leads  to  the  same 
conclusions. As a matter of fact, estimation of operating profit-based return rates generates results that
are highly similar, in general, to those based on the estimation of profit-based return rates in terms of
coefficient signs and statistical significance for all the explanatory factors and in terms of adjusted R2
values, F-test statistics and Hausman test statistics. (In particular, only one coefficient changes its sign
if it is initially statistically significant, no coefficient loses its statistical significance and no coefficient
gains  statistical  significance.)  Most  important,  the  effect  of  lagged  pollutant  emissions  on  operating

profit-based return rates is highly insignificant in all cases. Regardless of the operating-profits-based rate
of return being estimated and the regressor set or estimator used to estimate the dependent variables,
our results indicate that better air pollution control neither improves nor undermines operating-profits-
based financial performance. Thus, our previous conclusion is robust to the choice of absolute finan-
cial performance measure between profits and operating profits. Given this robustness, we do not display
the estimation results for operating-profits-based rates of return.

Last, we assess whether the effect of lagged pollutant emissions varies over time. In particular, we re-
estimate  Equations  (1)  and  (2),  while  allowing  for  year-specific  effects  of  lagged  pollutant  emissions.
Across all of the various rates of return – profits or operating profits relative to total assets, equity or
sales – and across all of the regressor sets, the estimation results indicate that each of the three year-
specific effects of lagged pollutant emissions are highly insignificant. Moreover, the estimation results
uniformly reveal that the effect does not significantly vary over time, i.e. the effect in one year does not
differ from either of the effects in the other two years; e.g., the effect in 1996 does not differ from the
effect  in  1997.  Since  these  additional  estimation  results  merely  support  the  general  conclusion,  we 
do  not  display  the  results  for  the  estimation  that  allows  for  year-specific  effects  of  lagged  pollutant 
emissions.

Summary

In sum, this paper examines the link from corporate environmental performance to financial perfor-
mance. In particular, it assesses whether better pollution control, as measured by lower air pollutant
emissions,  improves  or  undermines  financial  success,  as  captured  by  various  accounting-based  mea-
sures of financial performance. For this assessment, this study analyzes the effect of air pollution control
using a panel of Czech firms for the years 1996–1998. The analytical results indicate that better pollu-
tion control neither improves nor undermines financial success. These results provide no support for
the hypothesis that pollution prevention, generated by improved production processes, led to lower costs,
and thus, greater profitability.

Future research may wish to expand the time period of analysis in order to assess whether the evo-
lution  of  the  Czech  transition  economy  alters  the  link  from  air  pollution  control  to  financial  perfor-
mance. Perhaps, as the Czech economy matures, firms are better able to translate better environmental
management into a profitable venture.

Pollution Control in a Transition Economy

Appendix: Comparison with Other Countries in Central and Eastern Europe

The  Czech  experience  with  poor  ambient  air  quality,  initially  high  air  pollutant  emission  levels,  sub-
stantial  emission  reductions,  tightening  air  protection  policies  and  pending  entry  into  the  European
Union is similar to those of its neighbors in Central and Eastern Europe. Figure A.1(a) indicates that,
after adjusting for GDP, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia experienced sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides and
carbon dioxide emission levels in 1999 similar to the Czech emission levels in 1999 and similarly greater
than  EU  emission  levels.  Figure  A.1(b)  indicates  that  all  new  entrants  into  the  EU  from  Central  and
Eastern Europe, including the Czech Republic, will experience benefits by fully complying with the EU’s
environmental directives. In increasing order of benefits as a percent of GDP, the Czech Republic places
seventh  out  of  10  countries  and  the  variation  in  relative  benefits  is  not  substantial.  Thus,  the  Czech
Republic fits within a rather tight distribution of relative benefits. Finally, data from the Co-operative
Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-Range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe
(EMEP) indicate that Hungary, Poland and Slovakia experienced similar relative reductions in air pol-
lutant emissions – sulfur dioxide, nitrous dioxide and carbon monoxide – over this study’s sample period
of 1993–1998. Last, while each country attempting to enter the EU may have chosen a meaningfully

different path, any notable differences would seem less important than the countries’ shared target: entry
into the EU. As important, in order to hit this target, the countries all needed to introduce highly similar 
regulations.  For  all  these  reasons,  the  Czech  Republic  arguably  is  representative  of  several  countries 
in the Central and Eastern European region during its transition period towards EU accession.
