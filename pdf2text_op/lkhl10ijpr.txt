This study examines the antecedents and consequences of supply chain activities
and empirically tests many of the assumptions in the extant buyer–supplier
relationship literature. To analyse the validity of the research model and the
hypotheses, data was gathered from 271 manufacturing organisations in South
Korea through the administration of structured questionnaires. The results
suggest that trust, interdependency, and rate of technological change are major
factors that influence the level of operational and strategic information sharing
and collaboration, and that the higher the degree of strategic information sharing
and collaboration is, the greater the level of effectiveness becomes. However,
there is no significant relationship between the length of relationship and
information sharing and collaboration. Research and practical implications of
these findings are discussed.

Keywords: supply chain dynamics; supply chain management; collaboration;
information sharing

1. Introduction

In today’s hypercompetitive environments in which competition is among supply chain
networks rather than individual firms, firms are confronted with the need to effectively
manage increasingly extending supply chain activities beyond the boundary of the firm
(Patnayakuni et al. 2006). The supply chain has become the central organising unit in
today’s global industries (Miles and Snow 2007). Since an individual firm alone is not able
to satisfy diverse customer needs, firms move towards closer and more integrated supply
chains (Bensaou 1997, Monczka et al. 1998, Lambert and Cooper 2000, Mentzer et al.
2000, Wisner 2003, Cousins and Menguc 2006). Resources invested in supply chain
relationships enable information sharing and collaboration between supply chain partners
(Patnayakuni et al. 2006, Pramatari 2007).

Supply chain antecedents are the factors that enhance or impede the implementation of
supply chain activities. A review of the supply chain and organisational behaviour
literature reveals that there are primarily three groups of antecedents of information
sharing and collaboration (Mentzer et al. 2001, Guimaraes et al. 2002): (1) relationship

characteristics (trust, commitment,
interdependency, and length of relationship); (2)
organisational characteristics (top management support, cultural similarity, goal compat-
ibility, leadership, vision, and key processes); and (3) information/technology character-
istics (information quality, and rate of technological change). Recognising the importance
of these antecedents by a particular company is presented as a prerequisite to successful
supply chain management. However, few studies have investigated the effect of supply
chain antecedents on information sharing and collaboration.

Given this state of the current body of knowledge on the relationship between supply
chain antecedents, activities, and performance, the purposes of this study are (1) to identify
the antecedents and consequences of information sharing and collaboration for vertical
relationships within supply chains, (2) to develop a research model and hypotheses on the
relationships between the variables, and (3) to develop a measurement instrument to
validate the research model and test the hypotheses. One of the major contributions of this
study will be providing an integrative framework of the SCM to both researchers and
practitioners. As such, it should help both researchers and practitioners understand SCM
activities,
their antecedents, and potential effects on business and supply chain
performance.

The rest of this article proceeds with a brief review of the SCM literature reported by
previous researchers, a description of the research model and hypotheses for empirical
testing, a description of the research methodology, data analyses, a discussion of the
results, the implications of the findings for researchers and practitioners, and limitations of
the study.

2. Literature review

SCM research has focused on three categories: antecedents, activities, and, consequences.
Antecedents are the factors that enhance or impede the implementation of SCM activities.
A review of the logistics, marketing, and organisational behaviour literature reveals that
there are primarily three groups of antecedents of information sharing and collaboration:
(1) relationship characteristics (Morgan and Hunt 1994, Handfield and Bechtel 2002,
Kwon and Suh 2004, Rinehart et al. 2004, Chu and Fang 2006); (2) organisational
characteristics (McAfee et al. 2002, Pagell 2004); and (3) transactional characteristics
(Adewole 2005, Li et al. 2006). These antecedents serve as preconditions that need to be in
place in order for a firm to implement SCM with its suppliers and customers.

To achieve SCM objectives successfully, firms need to conduct a series of SCM
activities. A number of
studies viewed information sharing (i.e. exchange) and
collaboration as major SCM activities (Bensaou 1997, Monczka et al. 1998, Hill
and Scudder 2002, Moberg et al. 2002, Sahin and Robinson 2002, Lee and Lim 2003, Min
and Mentzer 2004, Morton et al. 2006, Krause et al. 2007). Information sharing and
collaboration have been identified and defined as either operational or strategic in many
studies (Mentzer et al. 2000, Moberg et al. 2002). To maximise SCM’s full potential,
supply chain partners need both operational and strategic information sharing and
collaboration. Operational information sharing and collaboration are as-needed, shorter-
term activities for obtaining operational efficiency. Strategic information sharing and
collaboration are on-going, long-term inter-firm activities for achieving strategic goals,
which deliver value to customers and profitability to partners. In the following, we review
major studies in the relationship among antecedents, activities, and consequences.

2.1 Antecedents, activities, and performance

Mentzer et al. (2001) provided a theoretical framework that consists of supply chain
orientation (SCO), supply chain management (SCM), and business performance. They
suggested that
the SCO variables include credibility, commitment, organisational
compatibility, an agreement on SCM vision and key processes, mutual dependence,
leadership, and top management support. The set of SCM variables suggested include
integrated behaviour,
information sharing, mutual sharing of risks and rewards,
cooperation, agreed vision and goals, process integration, and long-term relationship.
Performance variables include product and services offering, profitability, timeliness, and
availability. In a follow-up empirical study, Min and Mentzer (2004) developed
measurement scales in accordance with their theoretical framework, and investigated
empirically the relationships among these variables.

Monczka et al. (1998) investigated factors from buying firms’ perspective that affect
the success of strategic supplier alliances. The critical antecedents associated with the
success of strategic supplier alliances include alliance attributes (commitment, trust and
moderation, and interdependency), communication behaviour (information quality and
participation, and information sharing), conflict resolution methods (mutual problem
solving, persuasion, unilateral reprimand, and external reliance), and the existence of
a formal sourcing procedure (supplier and products). The magnitude of the effect of these
antecedents on alliance success was assessed. They found that trust and moderation,
interdependency, information quality and participation, information sharing, and conflict
resolution methods are important factors, among others.

More recently, Li et al. (2006) developed five dimensions of SCM practice (strategic
supplier partnership, customer relationship,
level of information sharing, quality of
information sharing, and postponement) and tested the relationships between SCM
practices, competitive advantage, and organisational performance. The analysis of the
data collected from 196 organisations indicated that higher levels of SCM practice can lead
to enhanced competitive advantage and improved organisational performance.

While the above-mentioned empirical studies have provided valuable insights into how
firms can improve supply chain performance, the following issues remain to be addressed.
First, there has been little research that integrates and analyses the relationships between
SCM antecedents, activities, and consequences
simultaneously. Second, different
antecedents may affect the operational and strategic SCM activities differently.

3. Research model and hypotheses

This study proposes an integrative research model that consists of a set of SCM
antecedents, activities, and consequences, and empirically tests
the relationships
between these model elements using a field survey of manufacturing firms from various
industries.

While trying to keep the research model parsimonious, we selected the antecedents
under investigation based on three criteria: (1) the antecedents which are expected to affect
information sharing and collaboration, and have been considered in many previous
studies; (2) the antecedents which are expected to affect supply chain activities, but were
not widely studied; or (3) the antecedents which need further investigation because of
mixed results. The antecedents which are expected to affect supply chain activities and
have been considered in many previous studies are trust, commitment, interdependency,
top management support, and information quality (Bensaou 1997, Monczka et al. 1998,
Lee and Kim 1999, 2003, Mentzer et al. 2001, Moberg et al. 2002). The antecedents which
are expected to affect supply chain activities, but were not widely studied, include length of
relationship, cultural similarity, and goal compatibility (Bensaou 1997, Lee and Kim 1999,
Patnayakuni et al. 2006). Finally, the antecedents which need further investigation because
of mixed results include rate of technological change (Mendelson and Pillai 1998,
Guimaraes et al. 2002).

Our model proposes a one-tier suppliers–manufacturers supply chain model. It would
be too complex and ineffective to investigate the three-stage supply chain activities among
supplier, manufacturers, and customers, because factors applicable for a supplier–
manufacturer tier and a manufacturer–customer tier are very different from each other.
Therefore, like most other researchers who limited their studies to the one-tier relationship
and performance, we focused on understanding the supply chain phenomenon in the
supplier–manufacturer business settings. It is hoped that future research will develop the
three-stage supply chain model and investigate the activities and performance of the entire
supply chain.

The proposed research model, as shown in Figure 1, consists of three categories of
antecedents (relationship characteristics, organisational characteristics, and information/
technology characteristics), two categories of SCM activities (information sharing and
collaboration), and two categories of performance (efficiency and effectiveness).
The research model will examine the relationships among these model elements.

3.1 Trust

In this study, trust is defined as the extent to which firms believe that supply chain
partners will fulfill their responsibility to each other in good faith. Firms will share
information based on the belief that the supply chain partner will forego opportunistic
behaviour and use the shared information in a mutually beneficial way. A number of
studies suggest that trust is also an antecedent of inter-firm collaboration (Monczka
et al. 1998, Kwon and Suh 2004, Morton et al. 2006). This expectation leads to the
hypotheses:

H1a, b: There is a positive relationship between trust and operational/strategic information
sharing, respectively.
H1c, d: There is a positive relationship between trust and operational/strategic collaboration,
respectively.

3.2 Commitment

Commitment is defined as the extent to which supply chain partners will maintain and
strengthen their business relationship. Morgan and Hunt (1994) defined commitment as an
exchange partner’s belief that an ongoing relationship with another is so important as to
warrant maximum efforts at maintaining it. Firms need to invest a considerable amount of
money, time, and labour in developing information systems for information exchange and
may face a risk because of information exposure. Thus, a commitment is central to all of
the information exchange and collaboration between trading partners (Moberg et al. 2002,
Yeh 2005). Commitment
facilitates investments highly specific to the relationship.
These investments make it costlier and more difficult for supply chain partners to switch
to other firms, thus strengthening the motivation and incentives for greater collaboration
(Bensaou 1997). Hence:

H2a, b: There is a positive relationship between commitment and operational/strategic
information sharing, respectively.
H2c, d: There is a positive relationship between commitment and operational/strategic
collaboration, respectively.

3.3 Interdependency

Interdependency is defined as the extent to which supply chain partners believe that their
business relationship is necessary. As inter-organisational interdependency increases, the


662

B.-C. Lee et al.

need for coordination and collaboration also increases and information sharing
becomes more important (Mentzer et al. 2001). In addition, as inter-organisational
interdependency increases, collaborative activities will increase. Based on these findings,
we hypothesise:

H3a, b: There is a positive relationship between inter-organisational interdependency and
operational/strategic information sharing, respectively.
H3c, d: There is a positive relationship between inter-organisational interdependency and
operational/strategic collaboration, respectively.

3.4 Length of relationship

Length of relationship is defined as the period for which supply chain partners have
a business relationship. When supply chain partners have an on-going long-term business
relationship, they are more willing to exchange information necessary for business
transactions including information related to new product development, product cost, and
quality (Bensaou 1997). As the length of the relationship increases, information sharing
and collaborative activities will increase (Ganesan 1994). Hence:

H4a, b: There is a positive relationship between the length of relationship and operational/
strategic information sharing, respectively.
H4c, d: There is a positive relationship between the length of relationship and operational/
strategic collaboration, respectively.

3.5 Top management support

Top management support is defined as the extent to which top managers at both
firms understand and support
(1998) argued
that collaboration among partners requires a leadership of
the top management.
Top managers need to understand supply chain partners and the effect of the inter-firm
collaboration in order to build a mutually beneficial collaboration (Mentzer et al. 2001).
Hence:

H5a, b: There is a positive relationship between top management support and operational/
strategic information sharing, respectively.
H5c, d: There is a positive relationship between top management support and operational/
strategic collaboration, respectively.

beliefs,

Cultural similarity is defined as the extent to which supply chain partners have similar
values,
facilitates
communication flow both within an organisation and between business partners by
ensuring continuity of norms (McAfee et al. 2002). Cultural similarity also facilitates
inter-organisational collaboration (McIvor and Humphreys 2002). Hence:

H6a, b: There is a positive relationship between cultural similarity and operational/strategic
information sharing, respectively.
H6c, d: There is a positive relationship between cultural similarity and operational/strategic
collaboration, respectively.

3.7 Goal compatibility

Goal compatibility is defined as the extent to which supply chain partners have clear and
agreed-upon transactional goals. Compatible goals facilitate SCM policy integration
(Mentzer et al. 2001). Sharing common goals will guide cooperative activities between
partners and facilitate resource integration and utilisation (Wathne and Heide 2000).
If supply chain partners have compatible goals, they will understand partner activities
better and increase information sharing and collaboration. Hence:

H7a, b: There is a positive relationship between goal compatibility and operational/strategic
information sharing, respectively.
H7c, d: There is a positive relationship between goal compatibility and operational/strategic
collaboration, respectively.

3.8 Information quality

Information quality is defined as the value of the information shared by supply chain
partners. Managers may not use information from supply chain partners if they do not
have confidence in information quality, and furthermore will not provide their own
information to their partners. Supply chain partners must perceive accurate, current, and
reliable information from other firms in order to facilitate information sharing and
collaboration (Petersen et al. 2005). Hence:

H8a, b: There is a positive relationship between information quality and operational/strategic
information sharing, respectively.
H8c, d: There is a positive relationship between information quality and operational/strategic
collaboration, respectively.

3.9 Rate of technological change

Rate of technological change is defined as the rate of technological change of the products
of the supply chain partners. Because technological changes cannot be dealt with by an
individual firm, firms try to build a close business relationship to jointly develop new
technologies and products (Mentzer et al. 2000). The increase in the rate of technological
change leads to a greater degree of environmental uncertainty (Bensaou 1997, Guimaraes
et al. 2002). Mendelson and Pillai (1998) showed that, as the business environment
becomes more dynamic, the use of internal and external communication technologies and
the adoption of informational focus strategies increase. When the rate of technological
change is fast-paced, partners will facilitate information sharing and collaboration.
Hence, the following hypotheses:

H9a, b: There is a positive relationship between the rate of technological change and
operational/strategic information sharing, respectively.
H9c, d: There is a positive relationship between the rate of technological change and
operational/strategic collaboration, respectively.

3.10 Information sharing and collaboration

In our study, operational and strategic information sharing is defined as the extent to which
supply chain partners intend to share operational and strategic information, respectively.

information is defined as information related to operational business
Operational
activities including short-term order, delivery,
inventory, and production. Strategic
information refers to information related to strategic business activities including
long-term pricing strategy, demand forecast, new product development, technology
development, and marketing strategy. Operational and strategic collaboration refers to
the extent to which supply chain partners intend to collaborate for operational and
strategic activities, respectively. Operational activities include short-term order, delivery,
quality, inventory, and production. Strategic business activities include long-term demand
forecast, new product development,
technology development, product design, and
training. As firms increase information sharing activities, they can reduce inter-firm
uncertainty and develop a more collaborative relationship (Lee and Kim 1999, Krause
et al. 2007). Hence:

H10a, b: There is a positive relationship between operational
operational/strategic collaboration, respectively.
H10c, d: There is a positive relationship between strategic information sharing and
operational/strategic collaboration, respectively.

3.11 Information sharing and performance

Efficiency is defined as the extent to which buyers save their resources from the supply
chain activities with sellers. Recently, supply chain efficiency has drawn much attention
from researchers (Sanders and Premus 2002, Ross and Droge 2004, Saeed et al. 2005).
Effectiveness refers to the extent to which buyers achieve their goals from the supply chain
activities with sellers. Information sharing between firms can solve information distortion
such as the bullwhip effect and reduce transaction costs (Simchi-Levi et al. 2003). When
firms share information that affects their business activities, they can accomplish tasks
more effectively by utilising the information systematically and coordinating their
activities
Information sharing concerning forecasting, promotion, and
marketing strategy will help firms reduce uncertainty and increase the effectiveness of
the firms (Salcedo and Grackin 2000). Based on the previous research results, the
following hypotheses are established.

seamlessly.

H11a, b: There is a positive relationship between operational/strategic information sharing
and the efficiency of buying firms, respectively.
H11c, d: There is a positive relationship between operational/strategic information sharing
and the effectiveness of buying firms, respectively.

3.12 Collaboration and performance

Once firms develop a collaborative relationship, they can increase their organisational
efficiency by minimising unnecessary efforts or redundant activities (Chopra and Meindl
2004). Collaboration enables suppliers to achieve cost reduction and stable growth
through economy of scale, product quality, and learning effect. In turn, suppliers can
benefit buyers by providing products at a lower price (Monczka et al. 1998). Therefore,
collaboration helps supply chain partners achieve their business goals. Hence:

H12a, b: There is a positive relationship between operational/strategic collaboration and the
efficiency of buying firms, respectively.

4. Research methodology

4.1 Instrument construction

A questionnaire instrument was developed for this study. Individual scale items are listed
in Appendix A. The scale items were developed based on the studies discussed in the
previous section. The construct of SCM antecedents consists of nine variables: trust,
commitment,
similarity, goal
information quality, and rate of technological
compatibility,
change. All variables except
‘length of relationship’ are subjectively measured in
comparison with their main competitors using the seven-point Likert Scale, with 7 being
‘Strongly Agree’ and 1 being ‘Strongly Disagree’.

interdependency,
length of relationship,

top management

support, cultural

Multi-item seven-point Likert Scale and structural equation modeling (SEM) have
been widely used in the questionnaire-based perception studies (e.g., Monczka et al. 1998,
Lee and Kim 1999, Moberg et al. 2002, Wisner 2003, Yeh 2005). Our questionnaire-based
instrument will be tested and validated for further hypotheses testing and statistical
analyses. As an alternative method to the questionnaire, more objectively quantifiable
metrics such as the profit (for performance), the number of innovative products (for rate of
technological change), and supplier dropout rates (for trust) may be used to investigate the
supply chain phenomenon. The quantifiable metrics may require different statistical
modeling approaches from SEM used in this study. For example, regression models would
be preferable with the quantifiable metrics depending on the purpose of the study and type
of collected data.

strategic

The construct of SCM activities consists of four variables: operational information
sharing,
collaboration, and strategic
collaboration. All variables are subjectively measured using the seven-point Likert
Scale, with 7 being ‘Strongly Agree’ and 1 being ‘Strongly Disagree’. Table 1 shows the
above-mentioned operational definition of each activity and related studies.

information sharing, operational

The construct of SCM consequences consists of efficiency and effectiveness. Efficiency
and effectiveness are subjectively measured using the seven-point Likert Scale, with 7 being
‘Strongly Agree’ and 1 being ‘Strongly Disagree’.

4.2 Data collection

The survey was conducted in South Korea between June 2004 and July 2004 utilising
questionnaire mailing and direct visitation to supply chain mangers of production
and purchasing departments in various manufacturing industries in South Korea.
All participating firms had headquarters in South Korea at the time of the survey.
When the firms have more than one supplier, they reported on the relationship with their
most important supplier. Three hundred questionnaires were mailed and 53 were returned
via mail and 250 were collected during direct visitation. This represents a response rate of
55.09%. Of the 303 returned questionnaires, only 271 fully completed ones were used for
data analyses.

The respondent characteristics are summarised in Table 2. No single industrial
sector contributed over 30% of the respondents. Most of the respondents represented

medium-sized firms, with 29.2% having fewer than 50 employees, 46.1% having 50 to
299 employees, and 24.7% having 300 or more employees. All in all, based on the sample
distribution, these figures provide sufficient support for the suitability of the sample for the
purpose of our research.

5. Data analysis

Two statistical analysis software packages, SPSS 11.0 and AMOS 4.0, were used to analyse
the collected data. Given the theory-driven approach to scale development, scale
validation was done using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis.

To test the scale validity, two sets of factor analysis were conducted: one for SCM
antecedents and the other for SCM activities and consequences. The factor analysis used
the principal component extraction method and Varimax rotation. It required that factor
loadings exceed 0.40. One item (TE4) from the rate of technological change and another
item (SC5) from strategic collaboration were deleted due to a low factor loading (see
Appendix A). The detailed information on standard deviations and inter-correlations of all
indicator variables is available upon request.

Table 3 shows factor loadings, Cronbach’s alpha, Eigenvalues, and variances explained
of all indicator variables. Cronbach’s alpha is a measure of the internal consistency of the
indicators measuring a given factor. The value 0.70 is considered the minimally acceptable
level of reliability for instruments used in research. All 15 constructs show acceptable levels
of reliability, with coefficients above 0.815. The cumulative variance explained of the
factors for SCM antecedents is 74.73%, which is acceptable. The cumulative variance
explained of the factors for SCM activities and consequences is 75.95%, which is also
indicator variables are over 0.690, far
acceptable. The factor loading values of all
exceeding 0.30, which, as a rule of thumb,
is considered the minimum loading for
interpretability (Tabachnick and Fidell 1996). The t scores for these values indicated that
all factor loadings are significant (P 5 0.0001), supporting convergent validity of the
indicator variables (Anderson and Gerbing 1988).

B.-C. Lee et al.

Evaluation of discriminant validity of the measurement model was based on the
variance extracted test (Netemeyer et al. 1990). Table 4 shows the comparison of
squared correlation and variance extracted estimates. According to the variance
extracted test, the discriminant validity between two constructs is demonstrated if their
variance extracted estimates exceed the squared correlation coefficient between the
two constructs. Table 4 shows that the variance extracted estimates (diagonal values)
are all greater than the squared correlation coefficients (values below the diagonal line).
Our findings support the reliability and validity of the constructs and their indicator
variables.

To test the theoretical research model (see Figure 1), a path analysis with latent
variables was performed using the structural equation model (SEM) with the scales
averaged to form composites and a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method.
Our sample size of 271 subjects was adequate for testing the full SEM (with 55 measured
items). Table 5 summarises goodness of fit indices. In addition to the chi-square test
statistics, five fitness indices were used to evaluate the adequacy of the theoretical model.
The 2 test evaluated the discrepancy between the theoretical model and the collected data.
The smaller the 2 value, the better the model fit becomes. According to Carmines
and McIver (1981), 2 to degrees of freedom ratios (2/df) around 3.0 or less are
indicative of an acceptable model fit. The 2/df in this study is 1.760, an indication of an
acceptable fitness of our theoretical model with the data. Given that model 2/df was less
than 3.0, RMSEA was less than 0.8, NFI and IFI each exceeded 0.9, and GFI and AGFI
exceeded 0.9 and 0.8, respectively, the observed data demonstrated good fit with the
hypothesized model (Bentler and Bonnett 1980). Table 6 summarises the testing results
of the 48 hypotheses and Table 7 provides test statistics.

6. Discussion

One of the purposes of our study is to develop a research model and hypotheses on the
relationships between the variables. Results of our study show that trust has a significant
positive effect on operational and strategic information sharing as well as operational and
strategic collaboration, respectively. This indicates that as trust between supply chain
partners increases, the level of information sharing to support mutually beneficial business
activities increases. Similarly, as trust between supply chain partners increases, the level of
collaboration to reduce uncertainty and risk increases, out of the belief that collaboration
will lead to a mutual benefit.

Commitment had a significant positive effect on strategic information sharing and
strategic collaboration. However, commitment does not play a significant role in
motivating supply chain partners to utilise operational
information sharing and
operational collaboration. These results may be attributable to the fact that strategic
information sharing and strategic collaboration bring about considerable business risks
as well as benefits for partners. Therefore, implicit or explicit commitment of continued
future transactions will
lead to more strategic information sharing and strategic
collaboration because of reduced risks.

Interdependency had a significant positive effect on supply chain partners’ willingness
to engage in operational
information sharing, operational collaboration, strategic
information sharing, and strategic collaboration. The results suggest that inter-firm
interdependency increases information sharing and collaboration because individual firms

alone cannot achieve competitive advantage when their business activities are strongly
interrelated with supply chain partners’ activities.

Length of relationship does not have any effect on all four supply chain activities,
suggesting that the motivation for information sharing and collaboration may not measure
up to the length of relationship once the relationship becomes stable. On the other hand,
companies may try to increase information sharing and collaboration with newly
developed partners to strengthen their future business relationship.

Though top management support has a significant positive effect on strategic
information sharing and strategic collaboration, it did not have a positive effect on

likely to happen without

operational information sharing and operational collaboration. Results show that top
management decisions are strategic and unstructured in nature. Because strategic activities
require a significant investment in specific assets and the benefits from the investment are
realized over the long term, inter-firm strategic information sharing and collaboration
are not
top management support. Therefore, strategic
information sharing and strategic collaboration require a higher level of top management
support. On the other hand, operational
information sharing and operational
collaboration activities are predetermined, structured, and routine. Furthermore, these
operational activities are less risky due to the clearly defined activity range and level than
the strategic activities. Therefore, they tend to take place to facilitate smooth business
transactions regardless of explicit top management support.

Cultural similarity has a significant positive effect on the operational information
sharing, operational collaboration, and strategic collaboration. However, strategic
information sharing was not significant ( p¼ 0.443). These results suggest that similar
corporate values, beliefs, and management styles increase information sharing and
collaboration through a heightened mutual
communication.
An alternative explanation is that once firms establish a business relationship with their
partners, they try to assimilate their inter-firm cultures to each other through more
frequent inter-firm interactions to make the supply chain work effectively. Results also
indicate that even when cultural similarity does not exist between the supply chain
partners, they are willing to share strategic information if their business needs dictate
information sharing.

trust and effective

Goal compatibility has a significant positive effect on operational and strategic
information sharing, respectively. On the other hand, goal compatibility does not have
a positive effect on the operational and strategic collaboration. The results indicate that
while a higher level of goal compatibility leads to a higher level of information sharing
because of the clear nature and direction of the shared activities, an excessive clarification
of the shared goal may lead to inflexibility to changing environments, constrain partners’
autonomy, and thus have a negative impact on collaboration.

While information quality has a significant positive effect on the strategic information
sharing, operational collaboration, and strategic collaboration, operational information
sharing did not ( p¼ 0.244). The recent advancement of information technology such as
EDI and inter-organisational information systems has improved the accuracy, timeliness,
and understandability of the operational information. Consequently, information quality
is no longer as important as before for operational
information sharing. However,
strategic information is unstructured and sometimes qualitative in nature, and requires
a higher level of information quality to be of value.

Rate of technological change has a significant positive effect on all four supply chain
activities. Results indicate that, as the rate of technological change increases, supply chain
partners try to strengthen their information sharing and collaboration. As the speed of the
new product innovation among supply chain partners intensifies and the uncertainty of
technology development increases, firms need to strengthen their information sharing and
collaboration through a joint problem-solving approach and an inter-organisational team.
information sharing has a significant positive effect on operational
collaboration, and strategic information sharing has a significant positive effect on
strategic collaboration. However, operational information sharing does not have an effect
on strategic collaboration, nor does strategic information sharing have an effect on
operational collaboration. Results indicate that the type of collaboration dictates the

Operational


676

need for a specific type of information sharing. For example, due to a mismatch between
the specific types of information and SCM activity, strategic information would be of little
value for operational collaboration, nor would be operational information to strategic
collaboration.

Operational information sharing and strategic information sharing have a significant
positive effect on buyers’ efficiency. Strategic information sharing also has a significant
positive effect on buyers’ effectiveness, but operational information sharing does not have
a positive effect on buyers’ effectiveness. While operational information sharing does not
add to the effectiveness dimension of the supply chain performance, strategic information
sharing is shown to be effective in improving information utilisation, activity coordination,
task completion, and customer satisfaction.

Operational collaboration and strategic collaboration have a significant positive effect
on buyers’ efficiency. Strategic collaboration also has a significant positive effect on
buyers’ effectiveness, but operational collaboration does not have an effect on buyers’
effectiveness. Results suggest that various types of close collaborative activities will help
supply chain partners complete tasks efficiently. Results also indicate that while
operational collaboration does not affect the effectiveness, strategic collaboration helps
buying firms develop a satisfying business relationship with suppliers and effectively
achieve business objectives by advancing new technology, gaining competitive advantage,
diversifying risks, and minimising uncertainties.

7. Conclusion

This study started with three main research questions: (1) what are the key antecedents and
consequences of supply chain activities?; (2) what are the effects of these antecedents on
supply chain activities?; and (3) how do supply chain activities affect buyers’ supply chain
performance? To answer these questions, nine antecedents of supply chain activities,
four supply chain activities, and two consequences were identified and defined.
These antecedents and activities were linked to supply chain consequences by drawing
on related studies in supply chain management.

trust,

interdependency, cultural

To validate the proposed research model and to empirically test 48 research
hypotheses, the data were collected from 271 manufacturing organisations through the
administration of structured questionnaires. Results of path analyses indicate that the
model is generally valid and 32 of 48 hypotheses are supported by the data. Major findings
are:
similarity, goal compatibility, and rate
of technological change are factors that influence the level of operational information
sharing; (2) trust, commitment, interdependency, top management support, information
quality, goal compatibility, and rate of technological change are factors that influence the
level of strategic information sharing; (3) trust,
interdependency, cultural similarity,
information quality, rate of technological change, and operational information sharing are
factors that influence the level of operational collaboration; (4) trust, commitment,
interdependency, top management support, cultural similarity, information quality, rate of
technological change, and strategic information sharing are factors that influence the level
of strategic collaboration; (5) operational information sharing has a positive effect on
operational collaboration and strategic information sharing has a positive effect on
strategic collaboration; (6) operational and strategic information sharing and operational
and strategic collaboration are factors that
influence the level of efficiency; and

(7) strategic information sharing and collaboration are factors that influence the level of
effectiveness.

Results suggest that trust, interdependency, and rate of technological change are major
factors that influence the level of operational and strategic information sharing and
operational and strategic collaboration, and that the higher the degree of strategic
information sharing and collaboration are, the greater the level of effectiveness becomes.
Results also show that strategic collaboration has a greater effect on effectiveness than
strategic information sharing. However, no significant relationship exists between the
length of relationship and all four supply chain activities.

7.1 Implication for researchers

information systems, marketing, and organisation theory,

First, by systematically integrating previous studies from the fields of operations
management,
this study
developed an integrative research model and contributed to the identification of the
causal relationships among supply chain antecedents, activities, and consequences.
Second, our study considered both information sharing and collaboration activities as
important mediating variables. Previous studies tended to focus on either information
sharing or collaboration and therefore could not analyse these variables at the same time.
Our study was able to investigate the individual effect of these variables on performance.
Third, previous studies did not investigate the relationships between the antecedents and
the operational and strategic activities and between these activities and the consequences.
In light of the limitations of the previous studies, our study analysed their relationships in
depth by distinguishing supply chain activities into operational and strategic activities and
supply chain consequence into efficiency and effectiveness.

7.2 Implication for practitioners

First, to facilitate information sharing and collaboration, supply chain partners need to
build mutual trust. The most fundamental factor that contributes to the formation of trust
is economic satisfaction. In addition, it is necessary to support partners via managerial
consulting and education and maintain transaction transparency as a way to build trust
via non-economic satisfaction. Second, to facilitate information sharing and collaboration,
supply chain partners need to increase interdependency. Buchanan (1992) suggested that
under an uncertain and dynamic environment a balance of power achieved through
mutual
interdependency helps constrain partners’ unfair power exercise and reduce
conflict and dissatisfaction. Third, before supply chain partners start business transac-
tions, they need to establish vision and goals together and communicate with each other.

7.3 Limitations of the study

As is typical
in many empirical studies, this study is not without limitations. First,
a number of important variables may not have been included in the research model that we
attempted to develop. Some factors would influence the performance variables. Examples
of such factors include size of suppliers (relative to buying organisation) and relative
power, number of suppliers, number and types of raw materials and products, nature and
complexity of production process, demand variability, etc. For instance, how cooperative


678

B.-C. Lee et al.

suppliers are going to be depends upon whether the buyer is small or large relative to
the supplier and whether the buyer has numerous alternative suppliers for an input
(i.e. competition in the supplier market). Therefore, future research needs to include such
variables while maintaining the conciseness of the model.

Second, focusing only on manufacturing firms may be another concern. To generalise
the results, a variety of industries need to have been included. In addition, extending
the research to include firms from outside of South Korea would have enhanced the
generalisability and usefulness of
this study focused on the
perceptions of buying firms and did not reflect on the perceptions of suppliers. Future
research needs to address the perceptions of both buyers and suppliers in the supply chain
networks and analyse perception differences between them.

the findings. Finally,

Despite the above-mentioned limitations, this study is one of the first attempts in the
SCM literature to provide an integrative framework. Not only will this study generate
fresh insights into the dynamic mechanisms among SCM antecedents, activities, and
consequences, but it will also lay the foundation for a richer SCM research model, and
thereby helps advance our current understanding of SCM.
