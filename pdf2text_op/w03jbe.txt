of Directors and their Influence 
on Corporate Philanthropy

Robert J. Williams

ABSTRACT. This  study  examined  the  relationship
between the proportion of women serving on firms’
boards of directors and the extent to which these same
firms engaged in charitable giving activities. Using a
Fortune 500  firms  for  the  1991–1994
sample  of  185 
time period, the results provide strong support for the
notion  that  firms  having  a  higher  proportion  of
women serving on their boards do engage in chari-
table  giving  to  a  greater  extent  than  firms  having  a
lower proportion of women serving on their boards.
Further,  the  results  suggest  a  link  between  the  per-
centage  of  women  on  boards  and  firm  philanthropy
in  the  areas  of  community  service  and  the  arts,  but
found  no  link  between  women  boardmembers  and
firm  giving  to  support  education  or  public  policy
issues. The implications of the findings and some areas
for future research are discussed.

In  recent  years,  the  number  of  women  serving
on corporate boards of directors has been steadily
increasing.  Although  still  relatively  small  in
number,  there  is  some  anecdotal  evidence  that
the number of women serving on a firm’s board
does  exert  some  influence  on  the  level  of  a
firm’s involvement in activities related to corpo-

rate  social  responsibility  (CSR)  (Stanwick  and
Stanwick,  1998;  Wang  and  Coffey,  1992).  One
component of CSR, the firm’s level of charitable
giving  and  how  it  is  influenced  by  the  number
of women serving on the firm’s board, has been
the  subject  of  some  limited  research  interest  in
recent years (Ibrahim and Angelidis, 1994; Wang
and Coffey, 1992). 

Background 

Women  are  slowly  gaining  on  men  in  their
practice  of  philanthropy,  especially  in  the  realm
of corporate philanthropy. As the percentage of
women  serving  on  corporate  boards  steadily
increases, women will play a larger role in deter-
mining how firms allocate their budgets for char-
itable  activities.  Professional  fundraisers  and
development officers should be prepared to learn
more  about  those  factors  that  motivate  women
in their charitable giving. Being knowledgeable
of  these  factors  will  assist  the  professional
fundraiser in allocating his/her limited time and
resources, and should improve his/her chances of
reaching fundraising goals (Newman, 1996).

Recently, several characteristics about women
and their motivation to give to charity have been
identified primarily through interviews and ques-
tionnaires. Women report that they tend to favor
new  projects  over  existing  causes,  they  favor
funding specific projects rather than unrestricted
gifts, and they gravitate to scholarships and social
programs (Gutner, 2000). Further, women report
they  are  generally  more  responsive  to  giving
in a crisis situation than are men. Women tend
to  view  charitable  giving  as  a  means  to  help
others and the community at large, and as a way

to  express  gratitude  and  their  moral  beliefs
(Newman, 1996). It has also been observed that
women,  more  so  than  men,  desire  updates  on
how their charitable dollars are being used, and
tend to view charity as a means to secure addi-
tional  friendships  and  involvement  in  the  com-
munity (Marx, 2000). 

While  evidence  is  growing  that  women  are
motivated  by  different  factors  than  men  toward
charitable giving, do women, and more specifi-
cally women serving on boards of directors, con-
tribute  significantly  more  or  less  to  charitable
causes than their male counterparts? And which
charitable  causes  do  women  prefer  to  support?
The  answer  to  these  questions  is  vitally  impor-
tant for the professional fundraiser, and serves as
the focus of the present study. Prior studies have
observed that women do have a greater orienta-
tion toward charitable giving than men, but there
is  only  anecdotal  evidence  that  women  actually
give more than men when given the opportunity
through their firms’ philanthropic programs. 

In  the  few  studies  that  have  examined  the
link  between  female  directors  and  their  firms’
involvement  in  charitable  activities,  the  expla-
nations  offered  as  to  why  female  directors  may
be more favorable toward charitable giving than
men  have  been  somewhat  ambiguous.  Some
argue  that  women  are  simply  more  inclined
toward philanthropic causes than men, especially
educational and social projects, and may be less
sensitive  to  the  economic  needs  of  the  firm
(Gutner,  2000;  Ibrahim  and  Angelidis,  1994;
Marx, 2000; Stultz, 1979).

It  has  been  argued  that  female  directors
may  be  more  inclined  to  promote  their  firms’
charitable  giving  programs  due  to  the  sense  of
empowerment  they  receive  through  the  act  of
giving (Marx, 2000). Perhaps, women view phil-
anthropy  as  a  source  of  power  and  a  means  by
which  to  make  their  presence  known  on  the
board  (Marx,  2000).  This  notion  of  empower-
ment,  if  valid,  might  stem  from  the  types  of
board  committee  assignments  often  given  to
female  boardmembers.  For  example,  women
often receive assignments on “soft” committees,
such as their firms’ public affairs committees. In
contrast, men are generally favored on commit-
tees having a greater impact on firm governance,

such as the compensation, executive, or finance
committee (Bilimoria and Piderit, 1994; Shrader
et al., 1997). Perhaps, the power to give may be
a means by which women, at least in their own
minds, can partially overcome any perceived dis-
advantage in firm governance.

Female  directors  often  have  backgrounds  in
such diverse fields as law, education, or nonprofit
activities,  and  therefore,  may  be  more  sensitive
to  a  firm’s  CSR  activities  than  male  directors
(Harrigan,  1981;  Kesner,  1988;  Stultz,  1979).
Female directors having backgrounds in nonprofit
activities  often  have  goals  that  run  counter  to
those  of  stockholders,  and  may  place  less
emphasis on firm performance than male direc-
tors (Wang and Coffey, 1992). 

The  few  studies  that  have  focused  on  board-
member gender and firm philanthropy have been
enlightening,  but  have  also  had  certain  limita-
tions. A study by Ibrahim and Angelidis (1994)
examined  the  orientations,  or  inclinations,  of
corporate  directors  toward  supporting  CSR
programs,  including  charitable  giving  activities.
Their  results  supported  the  notion  that  female
directors have a greater orientation toward char-
itable  giving  then  their  male  counterparts.
Nevertheless,  a  boardmember’s  intentions  and
his/her subsequent actions may be different. For
this  reason,  Ibrahim  and  Angelidis  suggest  the
need to examine if directors’ orientations do, in
fact, translate into subsequent corporate giving. 
Another  study  by  Wang  and  Coffey  (1992)
found  a  positive  link  between  women  and
minority  directors,  and  corporate  philanthropy.
While  highly  insightful,  Wang  and  Coffey
utilized  a  relatively  small  sample  of  78  Fortune
500 firms. Further, their study failed to control
for such variables as firm performance and firm
reputation, two variables that should exert some
influence on corporate giving.

While recognizing the important contributions
of these prior studies, the present study attempts
to build upon and extend these studies by more
rigorously  examining  the  link  between  female
directors and their firms’ involvement in philan-
thropic  activities.  The  use  of  a  much  larger
sample  size  of  firms  and  the  inclusion  of  addi-
tional control variables should help remedy some
of  the  shortcomings  of  the  prior  cited  studies,

and  should  help  clarify  the  nature  and  strength
of the relationship between boardmember gender
and  charitable  giving.  Thus,  the  following
hypothesis is offered.

Hypothesis  1:  The  proportion  of  women
serving on a firm’s board of directors is pos-
itively  related  to  the  firm’s  overall  level  of
charitable giving.

As  stated  previously,  the  giving  patterns  of
women  are  largely  derived  through  interviews
and  questionnaires.  There  is  little  evidence  to
support  the  notion  that  women  in  leadership
roles  in  organizations  actually  spend  the  firm’s
money  in  a  manner  consistent  with  their
surveyed  responses.  The  author  is  aware  of  no
large scale study that has examined how female
directors  actually  help  prioritize  their  firms’
actual expenditures for charity.

Women do report their desires to help others
and the community through charitable programs.
Women  generally  express  an  interest  in  sup-
porting educational programs that, among other
things,  enhance  educational  infrastructure  and
technical  support,  and  that  provide  scholarships
and  endowment  funds.  Women  also  express  an
interest in community service programs, such as
helping  the  disabled,  the  homeless,  hospitals,
medical research, and specific organizations like
the  United  Way  and  YMCA  that  strive  to
improve overall community welfare. Women also
report  their  desire  to  promote  the  arts  and
various  cultural  activities,  including  the  per-
forming  arts,  museums,  zoos,  and  libraries.  On
the  other  hand,  women  often  fail  to  state  very
strong  interest  for  organizations  and  programs
involved in issues of public policy, such as groups
actively  involved  with  environmental  issues,
public  interest  law,  public  safety,  and  govern-
mental efficiency. 

Given these basic propositions about patterns
of charitable giving among women, it seems rea-
sonable  to  assume  that  female  boardmembers
should  influence  both  the  level  of  overall  firm
philanthropy, as well as the areas in which char-
itable  dollars  are  expended.  In  an  exploratory
manner,  and  in  an  effort  to  gain  some  initial
insight,  the  present  study  examines  how  female
directors  affect  the  direction  of  charitable

spending.  Thus,  the  following  hypotheses  are
offered.

Hypothesis  2:  The  proportion  of  women
serving  on  a  firm’s  board  of  directors  is
positively  related  to  the  firm’s  level  of
charitable  giving  to  educational  organiza-
tions and programs.

Hypothesis  3:  The  proportion  of  women
serving  on  a  firm’s  board  of  directors  is
positively  related  to  the  firm’s  level  of
charitable  giving  to  community  service
organizations and programs.

Hypothesis  4:  The  proportion  of  women
serving  on  a  firm’s  board  of  directors  is
positively  related  to  the  firm’s  level  of
charitable  giving  to  the  arts  and  cultural
programs. 

Hypothesis  5:  The  firm’s  level  of  charitable
giving  to  organizations  that  seek  to  influ-
ence  public  policy  is  not  significantly
affected  by  the  proportion  of  women
serving on a firm’s board of directors.

Research design

Sample

The  initial  sample  included  all  firms  that  were
continuously  listed  on  the  Fortune 500  for  the
years  1991  through  1994  (196  firms).  Due  to
mergers and acquisitions, and the natural replace-
ment of some firms by other firms over time, the
majority of firms listed in 1991 were no longer
listed in 1994. After further review, it was deter-
mined  that  insufficient  data  had  been  obtained
on 11 firms, and those firms were dropped from
the sample. The resulting sample consisted of 185
firms for which adequate information was avail-
able regarding the variables to be examined.

Measures

Dependent variables. A measure of each firm’s total
charitable contributions (GIVING) served as the
dependent variable used to test Hypothesis 1 in
the study. The amount of each firm’s giving was


4

obtained  from  the  Corporate  500  Directory  of
Corporate  Philanthropy and  the  National  Directory
of Corporate Giving. In calculating GIVING, the
amount  of  each  firm’s  charitable  contributions,
in  both  cash  and  gifts-in-kind  (if  any),  for  the
1991–1994  time  period  was  determined.  Since
larger  firms  are  generally  better  able  to  support
higher  levels  of  giving  than  smaller  firms
(Stanwick and Stanwick, 1998), the value of each
firm’s  contributions  was  divided  by  the  firm’s
average revenues during the same time period in
order to control for the effects of firm size. Thus,
GIVING is a measure of charitable contributions
per dollar of sales, and as such, adjusts the depen-
dent variable for the effects of firm size. 

Four  additional  dependent  variables  were
obtained  in  order  to  examine  the  recipients  of
each  firm’s  charitable  expenditures,  and  to  test
Hypotheses  2–5.  The  variables  EDUCATION,
COMMUNITY, ARTS, and PUBLIC POLICY
were  derived  in  a  manner  similar  to  GIVING,
with  firm  spending  in  each  area  divided  by  the
firm’s  revenues  during  the  1991–1994  time
period.  Thus,  each  dependent  variable  was
adjusted for the effects of firm size. Data on these
four  variables  were  obtained  from  the  Corporate
500 Directory of Corporate Philanthropy.

Independent  variable.  The  percentage  of  women
serving  on  their  firms’  boards  of  directors
(WOMEN)  during  the  1991–1994  time  period
served as the independent variable in the study.
Female  directors  were  identified  through  Dun
&  Bradstreet’s  Reference  Book  of  Corporate
Managements,  and  through  each  firm’s  annual
reports  for  the  selected  years.  The  variable,
WOMEN,  was  calculated  by  dividing  the
number of female directors on each firm’s board
by the firm’s total number of directors. 

Control  variables.  There  is  evidence  that  a  firm’s
financial  performance  strongly  influences  its
level of charitable giving (McGuire et al., 1988;
Ullmann,  1985).  Obviously,  firms  with  strong
earnings  and  profits  are  better  able  to  support
philanthropic  causes.  In  contrast,  during  finan-
cially lean years and during economic downturns
firms  may  be  less  able  to  engage  in  charitable
activities.  Thus,  the  inclusion  of  firm  perfor-

mance  as  a  control  variable  seems  appropriate.
Firm performance as measured as average return
on equity (ROE) during the 1991–1994 period
was included as a control variable.

There is some evidence that a firm’s propen-
sities toward charitable giving may be influenced
by its overall reputation. Obviously, firms should
value their reputations, and philanthropy would
appear  to  be  a  logical  means  by  which  a  firm
could support and extend a favorable reputation.
Along  these  lines,  Williams  and  Barrett  (2000)
found  a  strong  correlation  between  a  firm’s
reputation  and 
its  philanthropic  activities.
Further, they also found evidence that firms that
are caught and sanctioned for their involvement
in  certain  types  of  illegal  activity  can  partially
restore their tarnished reputations through char-
itable  activities.  For  firm  executives  who  are
keenly aware of the potential link between firm
reputation  and  charitable  giving,  philanthropy
may assume a vitally important role in promoting
a  firm’s  success.  Thus,  in  light  of  emerging
evidence  that  a  favorable  firm  reputation  might
encourage a firm to engage in charitable giving,
firm  reputation  (REPUTATION)  was  included
as a control variable in the analysis. A firm rep-
utation score was obtained for each firm by using
the 1995 Fortune Corporate Reputations Survey.
The 1995 reputation survey was selected since it
provides  the  firms’  reputation  scores  at  the  end
of the 1991–1994 time period. 

Theory  suggests  that  a  boardmember’s  per-
spective (insider versus outsider) should influence
how the boardmember views the firm’s charitable
giving  activities.  Inside  directors  work  for  the
firm as company officers, and are generally more
familiar  with  the  firm’s  day-to-day,  operational
issues  than  are  outside  directors.  In  contrast,
outside directors are, by definition, outsiders, and
tend to be more independent and objective than
insiders. With respect to charitable giving, inside
directors  might  be  more  concerned  about  pre-
serving firm profits and might resist giving away
the firm’s earnings. On the other hand, outside
directors might be less concerned, since outside
directors  have  no  direct  claim  on  the  residual
profits  of  the  firm.  Wang  and  Coffey  (1992)
observed such a dichotomy between the views of
insiders  and  outsiders  in  their  study.  Therefore,

the ratio of inside directors to outside directors
(IN/OUT  RATIO)  was  included  as  a  third
control  variable  in  the  present  study.  As  with
female  directors,  both  inside  and  outside  direc-
tors were identified through Dun & Bradstreet’s
Reference  Book  of  Corporate  Managements,  and
through  each  firm’s  annual  reports  for  the
selected years.

Analytical procedures

The  hypotheses  were  tested  using  multiple
regression, with each of the five dependent vari-
ables  individually  regressed  on  the  independent
variable  and  the  three  control  variables  in  suc-
cessive runs. In the usual manner, the signs and
levels  of  significance  of  the  variables  were  then
analyzed as to their relationships with the depen-
dent variables. 

Results 

The  descriptive  statistics  are  presented  in  Table
I. The results of the multiple regression analysis
are presented in Table II.

In Table I, several significant correlations were
observed.  As  expected,  GIVING  was  positively
correlated with ROE (p < 0.001), with REPU-

TATION (p < 0.01), and with the independent
variable, WOMEN (p < 0.001). Since firm per-
formance  is  such  a  large  component  of  a
firm’s  reputation,  a  strong  correlation  between
ROE  and  REPUTATION  (p <  0.01)  was  also
observed. This result caused some initial concern
that multicollinearity among the variables might
be  present.  The  results  of  the  collinearity  diag-
nostics, however, indicated that the level of mul-
ticollinearity  present  did  not  pose  a  significant
problem in conducting the analysis.

Also observed were several strong correlations
among  the  dependent  variables.  This  was
expected, since firms generally contribute funds
to organizations engaged in two, three, or all four
of the charitable categories defined in the present
study. 

The average percentage of women serving on
the  boards  of  the  sample  firms  was  6%,  with  a
range of 0% to 26%. Surprisingly, 41 firms, rep-
resenting 22% of the sample firms had no women
serving  on  their  boards  of  directors.  The  firms
donated,  on  average,  $9.25  million  annually  in
support  of  various  charitable  causes.  The  range
in  GIVING  was  from  $65 000  (lowest)  to  $118
million (highest). 

Table  II  presents  the  regression  results.  The
overall regression model for GIVING was statis-
tically significant (p < 0.0001), and the model R2
was 0.27. Given the positive and highly signifi-

cant parameter estimate for WOMEN (p < 0.01),
the results provide strong support for Hypothesis
1, that women on corporate boards are strongly
linked to firm philanthropy in total. 

The regression model for EDUCATION was
significant  (p <  0.001),  however,  the  parameter
estimate  for  WOMEN  was  not  significant.  The
results  failed  to  support  Hypothesis  2,  as  no
support  was  found  for  a  link  between  female
boardmembers and charitable giving by the firm
to educational organizations and programs. This
finding  is  surprising,  as  women  often  report  a
strong  desire  to  support  educational  programs.
This suggests that education is an area where the
orientations of women toward supporting these
types of programs and their ultimate actions may
not coincide.

Hypotheses  3,  4,  and  5  were  each  supported
by the results. The results support positive links
between women and firm charity to community
services  (p <  0.001),  as  well  as  firm  charity  to
the  arts  (p <  0.01).  Hypothesis  5  was  also  sup-

ported,  as  the  results  failed  to  find  a  significant
link between women and firm contributions to
organizations  involved  in  public  policy  issues.
Apparently,  female  directors  possess  no  greater
commitment toward issues of public policy than
their male counterparts. 

Discussion

Given  the  results,  the  initial  impression  is  that
female directors may be more inclined to use the
firm’s  profits  to  help  others,  and  are  less  con-
cerned  about  the  economic  needs  of  the  firm
than  their  male  colleagues.  In  reality,  this  per-
ception  may  not  be  accurate.  While  the  actual
outlays for charitable giving are clearly evident,
any  benefits  derived  from  a  firm’s  charitable
activities usually accrue later, may be difficult to
measure,  and  are  often  overlooked.  Although
speculative,  the  act  of  giving  might  enhance  a
firm’s relationships with other firms and organi-

zations, and therefore, may positively impact the
firm’s future earnings to some extent. 

Charitable giving has been shown to improve
the  morale  of  a  firm’s  employees,  and  may
significantly  improve  a  firm’s  reputation.  As
Williams  and  Barrett  (2000)  point  out,  a  major
benefit from charitable giving may be to bolster
the reputations of firms who have engaged in and
have  been  sanctioned  for  their  involvement  in
certain  illegal  acts.  Considering  these  broader
notions  of  what  actions  are  in  the  firm’s  best
interests,  and  in  this  era  of  “strategic  philan-
thropy”, the fact that female directors may have
a higher propensity toward giving should not be
viewed as neglecting the economic needs of the
firm. 

The  lack  of  evidence  to  support  a  link
between female directors and firm expenditures
for  educational  programs  was  surprising,  espe-
cially  since  women  generally  cite  the  need  to
support  education.  Educational  institutions  at
various levels may receive funding through local,
state,  and/or  federal  sources.  Many  institutions,
such as private colleges and universities, conduct
active fundraising and capital campaigns, and may
amass substantial endowments. In contrast, com-
munity  service  and  cultural  organizations  often
lack  significant  and  consistent  governmental
support or endowment revenue.

Many  argue  that  firms  should  help  support
education  as  part  of  their  charitable  programs.
Such  spending  should  serve  to  enhance  the
knowledge base and human capital of the firms’
future  pool  of  employees.  Nevertheless,  female
boardmembers and possibly their male counter-
parts as well, might not view education as an area
with  pressing  financial  needs,  given  the  various
sources  of  funding  that  are  available  to  educa-
tional institutions. 

Those  organizations  relying  upon  charitable
contributions  as  a  significant  source  of  their
revenues  should  strongly  consider  the  implica-
tions  of  this  study.  When  seeking  corporate
funding,  additional  efforts  should  be  made  to
identify  the  gender  composition  of  the  target
firm’s  board.  More  extensive  lobbying  efforts
might  be  directed  toward  those  contributing
firms having a higher proportion of women on
their  boards,  especially  by  those  organizations

engaged  in  community  service  and  cultural
activities. 

The underlying motives as to why women may
be  more  charitable  than  men  remain  unclear.
Perhaps,  the  notion  of  giving  as  a  source  of
female  empowerment  has  some  merit.  If  valid,
the  committee  assignments  received  by  female
directors may significantly impact trends in cor-
porate  giving  in  the  future.  While  speculative,
as  more  women  serve  on  committees  having
more direct impact on firm governance, the need
by  women  to  use  philanthropy  as  a  vehicle  for
empowerment  might

however,  might  make  an  excellent  avenue  for
further research. 

subside.  Such 

Within individual firms, future research might
address the number of female directors needed to
affect  their  firms’  giving  policies.  As  Rosener
(1995)  points  out,  one  woman  on  the  board  is
often  dismissed  as  a  token,  two  women  on  the
board might not be enough to significantly affect
firm  policy,  but  three  or  more  women  might
create  a  block,  or  “critical  mass”,  having  major
policy  implications.  Further  examination  of
when such critical mass is reached within firms
would be insightful. Does the addition of female
directors  beyond  this  critical  mass  affect  firm
philanthropy or other policies to a greater extent?
Such  questions  were  beyond  the  scope  of  the
present study. 

As  the  number  of  women  serving  on  boards
rises in the future, a better understanding of the
dynamics  of  gender  on  corporate  philanthropy
and other firm policies seems warranted. While
this  study  serves  to  extend  prior  research,  the
findings offer a partial glimpse into the role that
gender  plays  in  influencing  corporate  giving
patterns. Further research in this area is strongly
encouraged.
