THE  EFFECT  OF  UNIONS  ON  FIRM  PERFORMANCE 

IN JAPANESE  MANUFACTURING 

GIORGIO  BRUNELLO 

Using data  on  a  sample of 979  union  and  nonunion Japanese 
manufacturing firms selected from the 1987 issue of the Yearbook of 
Japanese Unlisted Companies, the  author examines the  relationship 
between union status and firm performance in Japan. The  findings 
suggest that Japanese unions in the sample substantially reduced both 
productivity and profitability, as well as regular wages net of bonuses 
and fringes. These  three union effects were considerably smaller in 
small and medium-size firms than in large firms, perhaps because many 
of the small and  medium-size firms were subcontractors that were 
pressed by the firms contracting them to  cut costs and  increase 
productivity. 

THE  relationship between unions and 
firm performance has been the topic 
of extensive research in the United States 
and  Britain. In  a  recent survey of the 
research on  this subject, Addison  and 
Hirsch (1989) concluded that unions sub- 
stantially reduce  profitability but  their 
effects on productivity are quite small and 
just as likely to be positive as negative. 

Compared to the enormous amount of 
evidence  accumulated  for  the  United 
States, little has been done in Japan on this 
important topic. The dearth of empirical 
work on Japanese unionism can be  ex- 
plained at least in part by the lack of 
adequate data. MostJapanese government

surveys of workers and establishments do 
not include questions concerning unions. 
As a result, the ability to do even a simple 
cross-section study of union  effects on 
wages and firm performance is limited. 

This  paper  presents evidence on  the 
relationship between unions  and  firm 
performance in Japan based on a new data 
set covering 979  union  and  nonunion 
Japanese manufacturers drawn from the 
1987  issue  of  the  Yearbook of Japanese 
Unlisted Companies (Kaisha Soran  Mijojo 
Kigyo). This data set has two important 
advantages: it allows the researcher to 
explicitly discriminate between union and 
nonunion firms, and it includes a substan- 
tial number of both small and medium- 
size firms. A disadvantage of the data set is 
that the sample of firms is not random, so 
the results cannot be easily generalized to 
the whole Japanese manufacturing sector. 

Strategy 

This  study employs  fairly standard 
productivity and  profitability equations.

on wages, productivity, and  profitability 
are  closely  related.  Unions  use  their 
bargaining power to increase wages, to 
restrict work practices, or both. Higher 
labor costs lead  to substitution of labor 
with capital and of low-quality labor with 
high-quality labor. Union gains are likely 
to exploit profits accruing to firms from 
market power  or  Ricardian quasi-rents 
(Hirsch and Connolly 1987; Stewart 1990). 
The size of these gains and their effects on 
productivity depend on market structure 
(Clark 1984). On the other hand, unions 
can  boost  productivity by  acting as  a 
"collective voice"  that  reduces  worker 
complaints, turnover, and rivalry among 
employees and promotes loyalty and coop- 
eration (Freeman and Medoff 1984). 

Enterprise-based Japanese  unions are 
commonly viewed as weak, with a negligi- 
ble  or  even  negative effect on  wages 
(Kalleberg  and  Lincoln  1988;  Freeman 
and Rebick 1990; Nakamura et al. 1988), 
and as cooperative with management, at 
least since the labor disputes of the late 
1950s  and  early  1960s  (Koike  1988; 
Soskice 1988). Weakness and cooperation 
are  often taken to imply that Japanese 
enterprise unions are akin to "company 
unions" (Galenson and Odaka  1976). To 
put it differently, cooperation and wage 
restraint suggest that Japanese unions are 
likely to  increase  productivity without 
substantially reducing profits. 

In the only empirical paper I am aware 
of that explicitly addresses these issues, 
Muramatsu (1983)  found that Japanese 
unions do  indeed  increase productivity. 
He  did  not  explore,  however, union 
effects on wages and profitability. Mura- 
matsu's study was based on a data set that 
included productivity and  union density 
by  industry and  by  firm size.  Results 
derived from data of this kind are difficult 
to interpret, however, because such data 
do  not permit one  to distinguish union 
status effects from composition effects.' 

1 The  effect of a  change in an  industry's union 
density on average productivity in that industry can 
result from a change in the percentage of workers 
who are union members in the unionized firms in the 
industry, or a change in the number of unionized 

Unlike  Muramatsu's study, the  present 
paper uses a data set with information on 
productivity, profits, wages, and  union 
status all available at the firm level. 

The Data 

As mentioned above, the data are drawn 
from the  1987  issue  of Kaisha Soran- 
Mijojo Kigyo (Yearbook of Unlisted Companies) 
published by the Nihon Keizai Shinbun- 
sha. The Yearbook includes firms that meet 
four criteria: they are not listed in any of 
the country's stock exchanges; they have a 
share capital of more than 30 million yen 
(about $200,000); their gross annual sales 
are  over  500  million yen  (about  $3.5 
million); and they have provided sufficient 
financial information to  Nihon  Keizai 
Shinbunsha. These selection criteria imply 
that both the largest well-known compa- 
nies, most of which are listed in a  stock 
exchange, and  very small firms are  ex- 
cluded from the data. Perhaps even more 
important, all  firms that decide  not to 
disclose their financial information are 
ruled out independently of their size. 

From this sample, I drew a subsample of 
firms belonging to seven industries: Elec- 
trical Engineering, Textiles and Apparel, 
Steel, Industrial Machines, Glass and Ce- 
ment, Foodstuffs, and  Pharmaceuticals.2 
For each selected industry, I included all 
firms that provided the required informa- 
tion and whose fiscal year ends in the first 
three months of the year (January-March 
1987). The latter requirement is intended 
to avoid spurious heterogeneity induced by 
substantial differences in the end of the 
fiscal year. For instance, firms that end 

firms in the industry, or a change in the total number 
of firms in the industry, or a change in the number 
of employees in some or all firms in the industry. On 
the other hand, a change in an industry's productiv- 
ity can result from a change in the number of firms 
in the industry, or from a  change in the weights 
(employees per firm) used to compute the industry 
average, or from genuine changes in productivity in 
the industry. 

2 The firms in the seven sectors are distributed as 
follows:  Electrical  Engineering, 215;  Glass  and 
Cement, 175;  Industrial Machines,  112;  Textiles, 
141; Steel, 80; Foodstuffs, 170; and Pharmaceuticals, 
84.

their fiscal year in July include in their 
financial accounts the last round of wage 
hikes, the last summer bonus, and  new 
hirings, often concentrated in  April- 
none  of which are  included in the ac- 
counts of firms ending their fiscal year in 
the period January-March. 

The  final sample consists of 979 firms, 
596 of them unionized and 383 nonunion- 
ized.3 Fifty-nine of the firms have fewer 
than  29  employees,  279  have  30-99 
employees, 400 have 100-299 employees, 
206 have 300-999 employees, and 35 have 
1000 or more employees. Focusing only 
on firms with more than 20 employees, it 
is instructive to compare the distribution 
of firms by employment size in this sample 
with the distribution in the manufacturing 
sector as  a  whole, as  obtained from the 
1986 Japanese Census of Manufacturers 
(Tsusansho, Kogyo Tokei hyo Kigyo hen). 
The  figures in Table  1 show that firms 
with fewer than 100 employees are greatly 
under-represented in  the  sample  used 
here, whereas firms with more than 100 
and  fewer than  1,000  employees  are 
over-represented. Furthermore, despite 
the  over-representation of  firms with 
more than 1,000 employees, very large 
firms with more than 5,000 employees are 
completely absent from the sample, since 
the largest included firm has 4,789 em- 
ployees. 

The exclusion of large listed companies 
could be avoided by matching the Unlisted 
Companies data  with the data  from the 
Yearbook of Listed Companies (Kaisha Soran- 
Jojo Kigyo). I  plan  to take that step in 
future work. Little can be done, however, 
to take explicitly into account the myriad 
of very small firms, defined by Patrick and 
Rohlen (1988) as small family enterprises, 
in Japanese manufacturing.4 

For the purposes of this paper, I define 

3Notice  that the absence of a union does not mean 
that workers are completely unorganized. According 
to Koike (1983), nonunion firms often have associa- 
tions of employees (shimbokukai) that operate as 
imperfect substitutes for unions. 
According to the  1987 Japanese Employment 
Status Survey, more than  10%  of manufacturing 
employment was  in  firms with fewer than  five 
employees.

small and medium-size firms as firms with 
fewer than 300 employees and large firms 
as  firms with 300  or  more employees. 
This definition is similar to that adopted 
by the Japanese  Agency for Small and 
Medium Firms. According to the Agency, 
more than 50% of small and medium-size 
firms in  1987  were  subcontractors en- 
gaged  in  parts production or  discrete 
processing operations under special order, 
usually by a large firm (Japanese Agency 
for  Small  and  Medium  Firms  1990). 
Notice that 75% of the firms included in 
the data set for this study are small and 
medium-size firms. Even taking into ac- 
count the fact that the probability of being 
a  subcontractor varies with the industry 
and  is highest in Electrical Engineering 
and lowest in Foodstuffs, the presence of 
subcontractors in this sample is likely to be 
substantial. This fact has important conse- 
quences  for the  generalizability of  the 
results, especially if we accept the view that 
industrial relations in small and medium- 
size firms are quite different from those in 
large firms (Chalmers 1989). 

Table  2 presents the means and  stan- 
dard deviations of the main variables for 
all  firms, for unionized firms, and  for 
firms without unions. Detailed definitions 
of  the variables are  given in  the data 
appendix. Labor productivity SL, defined 
as  total sales  per  employee, is  13.5% 
higher in nonunion firms than in union 
firms.5 On  the other hand, the capital- 
labor ratio KL, defined as fixed assets over 

5Clark 

(1984:911)  used  both  sales  and  value 
added per employee as measures of labor productiv- 
ity. My data set includes only the former measure.

total employment, is 1.5% higher in union 
firms. Union  firms are older than non- 
union firms and have, on average, older 
employees. They  employ fewer women 
and pay a marginal wage premium (net of 
bonuses) with respect to nonunion firms. 
On the other hand, nonunion firms have a 
markedly higher rate of return on total 
invested capital ROI and a higher profits- 
to-sales ratio PS.  Profits are defined here 
as  current profits before  tax  (Keijoh 
Rieki). 

Additional  variables included  in  the 
table are the firm's market share (MS) in 
the  previous  fiscal year  (1985),  union 
density (MU) by firm size, and a dummy 
(D2) for affiliation of the enterprise union 

with a  union federation. Market share is 
defined as the ratio of sales in the main 
product line  to  industrial sales  in  the 
corresponding three-digit industry. Due 
to data restrictions, this measure is admit- 
tedly less precise than the measure sug- 
gested by Hirsch and  Connolly (1987), 
who  take  into account  firm shares  in 
multiple product lines and use four-digit 
industry data. Market share is, on average, 
0.477% in unionized firms and 0.277% in 
nonunionized firms, and it varies widely 
within the sample, ranging from nearly 
zero to about 20%. Union density, defined 
as  the ratio of union members to total 
employment by two-digit industry and by 
firm size, is strongly correlated with firm

size. Freeman and Rebick (1989) reported 
that union density in the whole Japanese 
economy in 1985 was 0.6% in firms with 1 
to 29 employees and increased monotoni- 
cally with firm size to reach 74.8% in firms 
with more than 1,000 employees. 

Unions and Productivity 

The  relationship between unions and 
productivity is usually evaluated by estimat- 
ing a production function augmented with 
a union dummy or with a measure of union 
density. (See  Addison and Hirsch [1989] 
for a discussion.)6 A very popular but overly 
restrictive specification of the technology is 
the Cobb Douglas production function. Re- 
cent research has adopted more flexible 
specifications, including the CES  and the 
translog production function. In this pa- 
per I use the second order approximation 
of a two-factor CES  technology proposed 
by Kmenta (1967). The two factors are cap- 
ital and employment. 

In  principle, hours worked should be 
included among the variables. Unfortu- 
nately, the  data  set  does  not  provide 
information on this variable. The omission 
of data on hours is likely to influence the 
results for at least two reasons. In the first 
place, it is known that workers in union- 
ized  firms work  (on  average)  shorter 
hours  than workers in  nonunion firms 
(see  Nakamura  et  al.  1988:34  for evi- 
dence).  In  the second  place,  it is  well 
known that hours in Japan vary consider- 
ably more than employment and that the 
relative variability of hours compared to 
employment is highest in firms with more 
than 1,000 employees. A rough proxy of 
individual hours is hours worked in the 
industry classified by firm size and  ad- 
justed  by  an  estimate on  the  union- 
nonunion differential based on work by 
Nakamura et al. (1988:33-35).  The adjust- 
ment method is  described in  the data 
appendix. I use this proxy to evaluate the 
robustness of the results. 

Since  the dependent variable is sales 
rather than value added, the restriction of 

6 A notable exception is Allen (1987), a study that 

estimated cost functions. 

the list of inputs to capital and employ- 
ment can  be  justified by  assuming  a 
two-tier CES  with value  added  as  a 
function of these two factors and  total 
sales as  a  function of value added  and 
intermediate goods. Optimal use of inter- 
mediate goods implies that we can substi- 
tute the quantity with its relative price, the 
real price of intermediate goods.  Given 
the lack of firm-specific information on 
this price, I  try to capture its industry- 
specific component by introducing indus- 
trial dummies. 

The  production function is augmented 
with a  set of variables that capture the 
effects of technical change, market struc- 
ture, the quality of labor, and union status. 
Technical change is assumed to depend 
on  the age  of the firm (YEAR)  and  its 
square, on  industry-specific effects, and 
on union status. Younger firms are often 
more innovative than older firms; unions 
affect technical change both because they 
influence work practices and because they 
affect the accumulation of capital (Grout 
1984; Nickell, Wadhwani, and Wall 1989). 
Market structure affects productivity both 
directly and  indirectly. As  stressed by 
Clark (1984:901),  the nature of competi- 
tion is likely to affect "both the opportu- 
nity and  the incentive for the firm to 
improve productivity after unionization." 
Market power and the associated rents are 
likely to influence wages and productivity 
through factor substitution. The  indica- 
tors of market power in the productivity 
equation used here are the firm market 
share (MS) and its square. 

Labor quality can vary between union 
and nonunion firms because management 
in unionized firms tries to offset higher 
labor costs by changing the composition of 
the labor force and by upgrading average 
worker ability (Clark 1980). Another rea- 
son average labor quality can  vary with 
union status is that unions influence the 
accumulation of  human  capital,  affect 
turnover, and bargain over the allocation 
of workers within the firm (Koike 1988). I 
proxy labor quality with the average age of 
employees (AGE) and its square and with 
the ratio of female to  male  employees 
(FEM)  and  its  square.  The  stock  of

accumulated human  capital varies with 
the age of employees. Female employees, 
on  the other hand,  are  more likely to 
take on less skilled part-time jobs  and to 
receive lower wages. These  controls are 
admittedly not sufficient to capture dif- 
ferences in  labor  quality. Data  restric- 
tions, however, forbid a more satisfactory 
specification, which would include at least 
occupation, education, tenure, and  type 
of labor contract (permanent or tempo- 
rary jobs). 

Union  effects on  productivity are  ac- 
counted for by including both the dummy 
UN, which takes the value of 1 if the firm is 
unionized and 0 otherwise, and its interac- 
tions  with capital  intensity, firm size, 
technical progress, market power, and 
labor quality. The resulting specification is

where i is the firm subscript, E is the distur- 
bance term, and "Interactions" denotes all

Unions and Profitability 

As  discussed by Clark  (1984),  union 
effects on profitability depend on whether 
the  wage-employment pair  lies  on  the 
demand curve or on the contract curve. In 
the former case, the rate of profit could 
rise or  fall in  the presence of positive 
union effects on wages and  productivity 
depending on the elasticity of substitution 
implied by the production technology. In 
the latter case, the rate of profit unambig- 
uously  falls. The  main  implication of 
Clark's discussion is that union effects on 
profitability are  ultimately an  empirical 
question. 

This  paper  adopts  two measures  of 
profitability, the rate of return on invested 
capital (ROI)  and the profit to sales ratio 
(PS),  a  price-cost margin index.  Both 

variables are based on accounting profits, 
a  notoriously poor measure of economic 
profits but the only one in my data set.7 A 
recent comparison of accounting rates of 
return before tax in Japan and the United 
States  reveals  that Japanese  rates  are 
much lower than American rates, part of 
this difference being explained by differ- 
ent  accounting procedures  (Ando  and 
Auerbach 1988). For the purposes of this 
paper,  it  is  important to  understand 
whether the difference between account- 
ing and economic profits varies with firm 
size and union status. It is well known that 
many small firms evade taxes by under- 
reporting rates of  return (Patrick and 
Rohlen 1988); since small firms are more 
likely to be  nonunion, this pattern sug- 
gests that the union-nonunion profit dif- 
ferentials presented in Table  2 are likely 
to be underestimated. 

A  more complete analysis of the rela- 

tionship between unions and profitability 
requires consideration of a  measure of 
economic profits such as Tobin's q.  The 
data  requirements for constructing To- 
bin's q, however, are not nearly met by the 
data set used  here. In  particular, I  lack 
information on accumulated depreciation 
and a detailed breakdown of fixed assets 
into machines, transportation equipment, 
and land, and cannot estimate the repro- 
duction cost of capital using the method- 
ology suggested by Hayashi  and  Inoue 
(1990). 

Therefore, my results relevant to this 
issue are more comparable to those ob- 
tained by Clark (1984)  and  (in part) by 
Hirsch and Connolly (1987) than to those 
obtained by Salinger (1984).  In order to 
make  the  findings on  the  relationship 
between  union  status and  profitability 
more comparable to results for U.S. firms 
and  lines  of  business,  I  have  chosen 
specifications of  the  profitability equa- 
tion(s) as similar as possible to the specifi- 
cations chosen by Clark and by Hirsch and 
Connolly. Specifically, I replace the capi- 
tal-labor ratio employed in the productiv- 
ity equation with the capital-to-sales ratio

Estimation Problems 

At least two problems hamper the estima- 
tion of productivity and profitability func- 
tions using sectional data. The first problem 
is that input quantities such as KL, L, and 
KS are likely to be correlated with the dis- 
turbances. I try to solve this classical identi- 
fication problem by using variables aggre- 
gated by industry and partitioned by firm 
size as instruments. When possible, I  use 
lagged values of firm-specific variables. The 
identifying assumptions are that the distur- 
bance E  is not serially correlated and that 
the variables aggregated by industry are or- 
thogonal to firm-specific unobservable phe- 
nomena such as managerial ability and un- 
measured worker quality. Current market 
share, defined as total sales of the firm over 
three-digit sales in the corresponding indus- 
try, is also likely to be correlated with the 
disturbance. Hence, in the empirical esti- 
mates I use the first lag of the firm market 
share rather than its current value. 

The second problem is that union status 
is likely to be correlated with the distur- 
bance. Unobserved managerial ability and 

8 Failure to control for KS could lead to biased 
estimates of the union effect if union status is 
significantly correlated with KS. 

worker quality vary with union status as 
firms react to unionization by upgrading 
the average quality of their work force. I 
deal  with this problem by using Heck- 
man's two-step estimator. The first step is 
to estimate a  probit equation for union 
status, and the second step is to augment 
the list of regressors in the productivity 
and  profitability equations with the esti- 
mated inverse Mills ratio and its interac- 
tion with UN (Duncan  and  Leigh  1985; 
Robinson 1989). 

Given the discussion above, the specifi- 
cation strategy is  simple.  I  start from 
equations (1),  (2),  and  (3),  and  simplify 
sequentially by excluding variables that 
are not significantly different from zero 
and by computing the relevant F test at 
each  step.  The  final  specification is 
achieved  when  further simplification is 
rejected by the F test. I estimate a probit 
model for union status and compute the 
associated inverse Mills ratio. The variable 
identifying the union status equation  is 
union density by industry and by firm size. 
Union density is likely to influence union 
organizing because "it increases the likeli- 
hood that some existing unions will have 
an  economic interest in  organizing the 
unorganized" (Freeman and Rebick 1989: 
594).  This likelihood will vary both with 
the industry and  with firm size because 
small  firms face, on  average,  a  lower 
probability of being unionized. 

Estimates of the final specification of 
equations (1), (2), and  (3)  are presented 
using both ordinary least squares (OLS) 
and  the combination of Heckman's two- 
step  procedure  with instrumental vari- 
ables for factor inputs (IVM).  Unknown 
heteroscedasticity is assumed throughout, 
and the White correction is applied to the 
standard errors of the estimates. 

Results: Union Effects 

on Productivity 

The effect of unions on productivity can 
be summarized by computing the percent 
change of labor productivity relative to its 
mean. Given that the dependent variable 
in the equation is lnSL, this computation is 
equivalent to taking the first derivative of

lnSL with respect to UN and  evaluating 
the variables appearing in the interaction 
terms at  their sampling means  (Lewis 
1986). The  computed percent change is 
-  14.64% in the OLS  case and  - 15.80% 
in the IVM  case.  In sharp contrast with 
Muramatsu's finding of a  positive union 
effect on productivity, these results point 
to a substantial negative effect. It is notable 
that this negative effect cannot be detected 
if the model is estimated without interac- 
tions. 

The  estimate of the union status equa- 
tion reveals that the presence of a union is 
more likely the older the firm, the greater 
the  average  age  of  its employees, the 
smaller the ratio of female workers, and 
the larger the union density in the same 
industry and  firm size.  These  results 
conform to our expectations. On the other 
hand, contrary to expectations, the firm 
market share  (MS)  has  no  significant 
effect on union status.9 

Turning  to  the  relationship between 
union status and productivity, column (1) 
in Table  3 presents OLS  estimates of the 
productivity equation  with  interaction 
terms, and  column  (2)  presents OLS 
estimates of the same  equation without 
interactions. A likelihood ratio test of the 
first versus the second specification clearly 
rejects the exclusion of interactions (the 
value of the X3  is 60.43, much higher than 
7.815, the critical value at 5 percent). A 
similar test also rejects the significance of 
interactions of UN with industry dummies 
(the X6  is  10.9, less than 12.59, the critical 
value at 5%). 

Given the nature of the data, this result 
is important because it suggests that union 
effects are  homogeneous  for the seven 
industries considered. Another implica- 
tion is  that quadratic terms cannot be 
excluded from the equation, which implies 
that a  Cobb Douglas specification of the 
technology is  not  appropriate.  Quite 
interestingly, the Chow test cannot reject 
the hypothesis that the parameters of the 
productivity equation  estimated in  the

sample of small and  medium-size firms 
are structurally different from the param- 
eters of  the  productivity equation  esti- 
mated in the sample of large firms. An 
important implication of this result is that 
the effect of unions on  productivity is 
likely to vary with firm size. 

Finally, I have tested the endogeneity of 
union status by fitting an  auxiliary pro- 
ductivity regression augmented both with 
the variables included only in the union 
status equation and with the interactions 
of these variables with UN (see Robinson 
1989  for  a  detailed  discussion).  The 
results of the x2 version of the test are 
puzzling because the Hausman test rejects 
the endogeneity of union status when the 
endogeneity of lnKL, (lnKL)2, and lnL is 
ignored and accepts it when the auxiliary 
regression uses instrumental variables for 
factor inputs.'0 

The  OLS  results show that the coeffi- 
cients of lnL and (lnKL)2 have, respectively, 
a negative and a positive sign. This result 
is difficult to explain within the frame- 
work of a CES  technology. It may reflect 
an inadequate control for working hours: 
if  the  correlation between  hours  and 
employment is negative and the correla- 
tion between hours and the capital-labor 
ratio is positive, the failure to control for 
hours will impart a  negative bias to the 
coefficient of lnL and a positive bias to the 
coefficients of lnKL and  (lnKL)2. If the 
size of the bias is large enough, it could 
change the coefficient of lnL from positive 
to negative and the coefficient of (lnKL)2 
from negative to positive. This interpreta- 
tion is  partially supported by the IVM 
estimates, in which lnL, lnKL, and (lnKL)2 
have been instrumented with a number of 
variables, including hours worked in an 
industry. In  that case,  the sign of the 
coefficient of  lnL  for  union  firms is 
positive. ' ' 

'0  The  F  version of the test used  by Robinson 

yields the same qualitative results. 

"  Notice  that  the  correlation between  hours 
worked in  an  industry corrected for the union- 
nonunion differential and employment is -0.3  and 
the correlation between hours worked by industry 
and KL is 0.04. Another possible explanation of the 
negative sign of lnL is that market share (MS)  is a

size (L).  As the results of the Chow test 
suggest, however, the  relationship be- 
tween firm size and union effects needs 
further scrutiny and can be better ascer- 
tained  by  estimating the  productivity 
equation in two subsamples: the sample of 
738 small and medium-size firms, and the 
sample of 241 large firms. 

If this estimation is performed using 
OLS, the effect of union status on produc- 
tivity turns out to be  - 1.6% in small and 
medium-size  firms and  a  remarkable 

function of 1985 employment because it depends on 
1985  sales.  Since  employment in Japan  is highly 
persistent, employment in 1985 and employment in 
1986 are likely to be highly correlated. In this case, 
the positive effect of market share on productivity 
could be a proxy of the positive effect of employment 
on productivity. If it is, the sign of the overall effect 
of lnL on lnSL could turn out to be positive.

- 28%  in  large  firms. Moreover,  the 
interaction between UN and lnL remains 
positive and  significant in  small  and 
medium-size firms but is not significant in 
large  firms. This  finding suggests two 
things. First, the negative effect of unions 
on productivity in the whole sample stems 
mainly from the substantial negative effect 
found in large firms. Second, the size of 
the negative effect of unions on productiv- 
ity found  for  small  and  medium-size 
Japanese firms is comparable to the effect 
found  by  Clark  (1984)  for large  and 
diversified U.S. businesses. 

I can offer only speculative explanations 
for these findings. On the one hand, there 
is little doubt that a large proportion of 
the  738  firms with  fewer  then  300 
employees are likely to be in a subcontract- 
ing relationship with one or several larger 
firms. In Japan, subcontractors are under 
constant pressure by the firms contracting 
them to reduce costs and increase produc- 
tivity (Uekusa  1988).  As a  consequence, 
the subcontracting relationship could act 
as  a  disciplinary device on  unions and 
restrain their negative impact on produc- 
tivity. Furthermore, unions in larger firms 
are likely to be stronger and the manage- 
ment in those firms is likely to be  less 
pressured by competition to cut unit costs 
and  increase  productivity.  Stronger 
unions  reduce  productivity by  limiting 
management's discretion in the allocation 
of workers, including transfers, promo- 
tions, and redundancies (Koike 1988). 

If being listed in a stock exchange is a 
sign of the quality of a  large firm, the 
substantial negative effect of unions on 
the productivity of the large firms in this 
sample  could  also  indicate  that  those 
firms, all of which are  unlisted, are  of 
inferior quality. (By quality of the firm, I 
mean the quality of its management, and 
particularly its management's ability to 
offset, at least in part, the negative impact 
of unionism.) To the extent that listed and 
unlisted large firms differ in this respect, 
clearly the results of the study cannot be 
extended  to  large  listed  (and  mostly 
unionized) Japanese corporations. 

Last but not least, the negative effect of 
union status on productivity could also be 

explained  by  the  fact that workers in 
unionized firms work shorter hours. In an 
attempt to  capture  this effect, I  have 
included the average number of annual 
hours worked in an industry, corrected by 
an estimate of the union-nonunion hours 
differential described in the data appen- 
dix,  in  the  original specification. This 
adjustment, however, reduces the overall 
union effect estimated by OLS  only mar- 
ginally, from - 14.64% to - 12%. 

Results: Union Effects 

on Profitability 

Turning  to  the  relationship between 
union  status and  profitability, the esti- 
mates of equations (2) and (3) are shown 
in Table 4, where the dependent variable 
is ROI, and in Table 5, where the depen- 
dent variable is PS.  Both tables present 
results of the same tests discussed in Table 
3. The  results are similar with the excep- 
tion of the Hausman test. Contrary to the 
findings for  productivity, the  test for 
endogeneity of union status based on the 
OLS  regression yields the same result as 
the test based on the IVM regression: both 
reject the endogeneity of UN. 

The  overall impact of union status is 
measured by the percent change of ROI 
and PS relative to their sample means. In 
both cases, the effect of unions on profit- 
ability is substantial and negative. If  the 
dependent variable is ROI,  the rate of 
return on  invested capital, this effect is 
-  19.56%  with  OLS  estimates  and 
-23.80%  with IVM  estimates; and if the 
dependent  variable  is  PS,  the  profits- 
to-sales ratio, the  effect of  unions  on 
profitability is - 36.5% with OLS estimates 
and -37.3%  with IVM estimates. 

The  size  of  this  negative  effect is 
comparable to the size found in a number 
of U.S.  studies. Clark (1984)  used micro 
data and found that unions reduced PS by 
about 18% and ROI by about 19%. Hirsch 
and Connolly (1987) also used micro data, 
and  they found that PS  was  lower by 
in  union  firms.  Freeman 
11%-17% 
(1983), on the other hand, used data for 
aggregate manufacturing and found that 
his measure of the price-cost margin was

39%-44%  lower in union firms than in 
nonunion  firms. Further evidence  dis- 
cussed  in  Addison  and  Hirsch  (198.9) 
confirms that  unions  have  substantial 
negative effects on  profitability in  the 
United States. 

Before turning to the interpretation of 
the results, it is important to stress that the 
omission of relevant variables could play 
an  important role. Hirsch and  Connolly 
(1987),  for instance, included R&D  and 
advertising intensity in their regressions 
explaining OS in large U.S. businesses and 
concluded  that these two variables are 
"important determinants of profitability 
whose  omission  is  likely to  result in 

statistical bias"  (p.  126).  Unfortunately, 
the  data  for  this analysis contain  no 
information either on R&D or on advertis- 
ing. Hence, I can only observe that Hirsch 
and Connolly found that the inclusion of 
these variables reduced the negative effect 
of unionism on profits per sale. 

As  with productivity, the  Chow  test 
rejects the absence of a structural differ- 
ence between small and medium-size firms 
on the one hand and large firms on the 
other. If, for instance, the profitability 
equation for ROI  is estimated in the two 
subsamples by OLS,  it turns out that the 
percent change  in  ROI  relative to  its 
sample  mean  is  - 15.5%  in  small and

-41.4%  in large firms. 

How do we explain these results? The 

negative effect of unions on productivity 
discussed above is clearly part of the story. 
Another important factor is the union- 
nonunion  wage  differential. Unfortu- 
nately, the  data  do  not  allow  a  fully 
satisfactory estimation of this differential, 
mainly because  the only available wage 
information is the regular wage  net of 
bonuses and fringes. 

These problems notwithstanding, I have 
estimated a  fairly standard equation for 
the regular wage, in which the depen- 
dent  variable  is  the  logarithm of  the 
average regular wage  and  the explana- 
tory variables are labor quality indicators 
(AGE, FEM,  and  their squares), a  mea- 
sure of the firm's market power (MS and 
its square),  the age  of the firm (YEAR

-4.3%  in small and  medium-size firms 
and  +3.7%  in large firms. It is not clear, 
however, whether the negative impact of 
unions  on  the  regular  wage  can  be 
extended  to  total earnings inclusive of 
bonuses and fringe benefits. On  the one 
hand, the evidence presented by Blanch- 
flower and Freeman (1990)  suggests that 
Japanese  unions  do  not  raise  regular 
wages  (at  least  for men)  but  do  raise 
bonuses and  severance pay substantially.

sented by Kalleberg and  Lincoln (1988), 
based  on  earnings  gross  of  bonuses, 
confirms the negative impact of Japanese 
unionism. 

The finding that both wages and profit- 
ability are lower in union firms contradicts 
the reasonable expectation that profits will 
increase as wages decrease among compa- 
rable firms. A  closer look reveals, how- 
ever, that although lower wages usually 
lead  to higher gross profits, they do  not 
necessarily lead to a higher rate of profit, 
that is, profits as a percentage of a firm's 
assets or sales. The latter measure may rise 
or fall depending on whether the elasticity 
of substitution between labor and capital is 
greater or lower than one  (Clark  1984: 
897).  More  generally, the  relationship 
between union status and  rate of profit 
crucially depends on the pricing decisions

INDUSTRIAL  AND  LABOR  RELATIONS  REVIEW 

of firms, on  the technology they adopt, 
and  on  whether unions  bargain  over 
employment levels. 

The question of why union firms should 
pay lower wages than nonunion firms in 
Japan warrants further reflection. Kalle- 
berg and Lincoln (1988)  tried to explain 
their finding that unions reduce  wages 
gross of bonuses by speculating that the 
Japanese  labor  market is  much  more 
integrated than the  U.S.  labor  market. 
Hence,  they argued, "nonunion compa- 
nies  in Japan  may be  under  stronger 
competitive pressures to  pay at  least a 
union wage, and  perhaps more, if they 
wish to  retain a  nonunion  workforce" 
(1988:S147).  I  find Kalleberg and  Lin- 
coln's speculation appealing  but incom- 
plete, because it fails to account for lower 
profitability in  conjunction with lower 
wages in Japanese union firms. An alter- 
native speculation, one  that avoids  the 
problems discussed by Clark and reported 
above by reversing the causal ordering of 
the two variables,'3 is that union firms pay 
lower wages because unions reduce profit- 
ability. The link between lower profitabil- 
ity and lower wages can be provided either 
by recruiting costs or by rent-sharing. 

The  argument concerning recruiting 
costs is well summarized by Montgomery 
(1991:164-65): 
If it is somehow difficult for firms and workers 
to form a match, and if a firm can increase the 
probability of filling a vacancy by offering a 
higher wage, firms for which unfilled vacancies 
are relatively more expensive will pay higher 
wages. Thus, highly profitable firms (in which 
valuable orders would go unfilled if a vacancy 
persisted) ...  will pay higher wages. 
If recruiting costs are about the same in 
union  and  nonunion firms and  unions 
reduce  profitability (and  productivity), 
union firms will find unfilled vacancies 
relatively less expensive than nonunion 
firms, where profitability is higher, and 
will offer lower wages. 

A  similar argument is  based  on  the 
rent-sharing hypothesis. If workers, both

lead to higher or lower profitability. 

in union and in nonunion firms, share the 
firm's rents with stockholders (see  Aoki 
1984:104-106)  and the workers' share is 
OR, where R is rents and  050?1,  lower 
profitability in union firms means fewer 
rents (R) to be shared. This could lead to 
lower wages in union firms even if the 
bargained 0 is higher. 

Conclusions 

My purpose in this paper has been to 
provide some empirical evidence on  the 
relationship between  unions  and  firm 
performance in Japan.  Given the wide- 
spread  interest in  Japanese  industrial 
relations and the dearth of empirical work 
on the topic, the emphasis has been on a 
comparative perspective. There  are  two 
main sets of findings. 

First, unions in the data set employed in 
this study substantially reduced both pro- 
ductivity and  profitability. They also re- 
duced regular wages, that is, wages exclu- 
sive of bonuses and fringe benefits. Only 
one of these three results-that for profit- 
ability-has  been  found in  similar U.S. 
studies. The U.S. evidence suggests small, 
possibly positive union effects on produc- 
tivity, and sizable positive effects of unions 
on wages. Perhaps the most notable result 
of this study is the absence of any evidence 
that the  sampled  Japanese  unions, by 
cooperating with management and  by 
exerting a positive "collective voice" effect, 
contributed to the achievement of high 
productivity standards. 

Second, all these effects are substantially 
smaller in small and  medium-size firms 
than in large firms. One possible explana- 
tion of this pattern is that many small and 
medium-size firms are subcontractors and 
are under pressure by the firms contract- 
ing them to cut costs and increase produc- 
tivity. This  pressure is weaker in larger 
firms, where stronger unions restrict man- 
agement's discretion within the firm. An- 
other possible explanation of this pattern 
of results is that the data set used for the 
study selects mainly "good"  small  and 
medium-size firms and "bad" large firms. 
In  particular, the  exclusion  from my 
sample  of  those  large  and  successful

unionized Japanese corporations that are 
listed in  the stock exchanges could  be 
responsible for the observed large nega- 
tive effect of unions on productivity and 
profitability in the large firms. 

I believe that these results are interest- 
ing for at least two reasons. The  first is 
that they do not conform easily to the view 
that  Japanese  unions  are  "company" 
unions, that is, weak and with a negligible 
role to play in the firm. Contrary to this 
common assumption, my findings support 
the view that unions in Japan, although 
not effective in raising regular wages, are 
quite effective in reducing both productiv- 

ity and profitability. A second noteworthy 
implication of the study, following from the 
finding that unions in smaller firms in the 
sample reduce profitability and productiv- 
ity less than unions in large firms do, is that 
industrial relations in small and medium- 
size Japanese firms are quite different from 
those in large Japanese firms. 

Given  the  nature  of  the  data  set, 
however, the findings of this study cannot 
be generalized to the entire manufactur- 
ing sector in Japan. In particular, future 
research should use data that cover large 
and  successful  unionized  corporations 
listed in the country's stock exchanges. 

Data Appendix 

Variable Definitions and Sources 

Nine variables are all taken from the same source, 
Nihon  Keizai  Shinbunsha, Nikkei, Kaisha Soran- 
Mijijo Kigyo (1987):  S (total sales); L  (total employ- 
ment); YEAR (number of years since the firm was 
established); AGE  (average age  of the employees); 
FEM (ratio of female to male employees); ROI (ratio 
of current profits [Keijoh Rieki] to total assets of the 
firm; PS  (ratio of  current profits to  total sales 
[Uriagedaka Keijoh Riekiritsu]); D1 (a dummy equal 
to 1 if the firm has a union and 0 otherwise); and D2 
(a  dummy equal  to  1  if the enterprise union  is 
affiliated with a union federation and 0 otherwise). 
UM is the percentage of workers unionized in the 
industry, by size of firm (fewer than 29 employees, 
30 to 99, 100 to 299, 300 to 999, and 1,000 or more 
employees), defined as the ratio of union members to 
total employees. The  number of union members by 
two-digit industry and  firm size is from the Labor 
Union Basic Survey (Rodo Kumiai Kihon Chosa), 1984 
and  1985 issues. Following Muramatsu (1983), the 
number of employees in firms with between 20 and 
999  employees is from the Census of Manufactur- 
ers-Firm  Data (Kogyo Tokei hyo Kigyo hen). The 
Census does not provide data on firms with fewer 
than 20 employees. An estimate of the number of 
employees in the lowest class is obtained by using the 
Establishment Data (Kogyo Tokei Sangyo hen). This 
estimate is admittedly approximate, both because the 
establishment data consider only establishments with 
more than 4 employees and, obviously, because firms 
and  establishments do  not coincide even for very 
small sizes. Unlike Muramatsu, I cannot use employ- 
ment in  firms with more than  1,000 employees, 
because this number is lower than union member- 
ship  in  some  industries (foodstuffs is  a  good 
example). My estimate is the number of employees in 
firms with more than 1,000 employees provided by 
the Survey on the Wage Structure (Chingin Census). 
The  definitions of employees in the Survey and in 

the  Census  are  different especially because  the 
former includes only regular workers. Union density 
by firm size is computed as the simple average of 
union density in 1984 and 1985. 

MS is the market share, defined as sales of the firm 
over sales in the three-digit industry corresponding 
to the main product line. Data on sales in an industry 
(three-digit) are from the Census of Manufacturers, 
Firm Data. As mentioned above, the Census does not 
include firms with fewer than 20 employees, so my 
measure of market share overestimates true market 
share in all the firms in the sample. 

IW,  IVAD,  IL,  and  IKL  are,  respectively, cash 
earnings, value added, employment, and the capital- 
labor ratio by industry and firm size. All variables are 
from the Census of Manufacturers, Firm Data. The 
firm size ranges are 20 to 29, 30 to 99, 100 to 299, 
300 to 999, and  1,000 or more employees. In some 
industries the data  for firms with 1,000 or more 
employees are missing. I estimated these values by 
taking the  difference between  the  total  in  the 
industry and  the  values  in  the  other firm size 
categories. 

H  is hours worked per year per employee in an 
industry, partitioned by firm size, from the Monthly 
Labor  Survey (Maitsuki Kinro Rodo  Tokei).  The 
firm size categories are 5-29, 30-99,  100-499,  and 
500 or more employees. The union-nonunion differ- 
ential in total working hours is based on the estimate 
of the union-nonunion differential in regular work- 
ing hours presented by Nakamura  et al.  (1988). 
Nakamura reported regular working hours by union 
status and by firms with 10-29, 30-49,  50-99, and 
100-299  employees.  I  assume  that the  average 
union-nonunion differential in firms with 100 to 299 
employees is equal  to the average union-nonunion 
differential in firms with more than 299 employees. I 
also compute the average union-nonunion differen- 
tial for firms with 30 to 99 employees using the data

for firms with 30-49 and 50-99 employees. I assume 
that the differential in total working hours can be 
roughly proxied  with the  differential in  regular 

working hours, and  I  compute H  by applying the 
estimated coefficients to  the raw  data  from the 
Monthly Labor Survey.
