Les  auteurs  ont  décrit  et  mis  à  l’épreuve  les  liens  supposés  exister  entre
les différences individuelles (les auto-évaluations spéciﬁques au travail et
générales),  les  variables  contextuelles  (les  croyances  relatives  au  contrôle  des
tâches)  et  trois  attitudes  professionnelles  (la  satisfaction  relative  à  l’emploi,
l’engagement organisationnel et l’implication liée au poste). Les résultats tirés
d’une investigation portant sur 159 salariés des services de santé montrent que
les auto-évaluations, en particulier l’estime de soi liée à l’organisation, prédis-
ent  fortement  les  attitudes  professionnelles.  En  outre,  les  auto-évaluations
spéciﬁques  au  travail  permettent  d’expliquer  pourquoi  et  comment  les  auto-
évaluations  générales  et  les  croyances  relatives  au  contrôle  des  tâches  sont
reliées  aux  attitudes  professionnelles.  En  dernière  analyse,  les  corrélations
entre les auto-évaluations générales et l’estime de soi liée à l’organisation
étaient  modulées  par  les  croyances  relatives  au  contrôle  des  tâches.  On
réﬂéchit  à  ce  que  ces  résultats  peuvent  apporter  à  la  théorie  et  à  la  pratique

commitment,  and  job  involvement).  Results  from  a  study  of  159  healthcare
employees found that work-speciﬁc self-evaluations, particularly organisation-
based  self-esteem,  strongly  predicted  job  attitudes.  Moreover,  work-speciﬁc
self-evaluations  helped  explain  why  and  how  general  self-evaluations  and
work-related  control  beliefs  relate  to  job  attitudes.  Finally,  the  correlations
between  general  self-evaluations  and  organisation-based  self-esteem  were
moderated  by  work-related  control  beliefs.  Contributions  to  organisational
theory and practice, as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Ever  since  the  early  Hawthorne  studies  (Roethlisberger  &  Dickson,  1939),
industrial  and  organisational  psychologists  have  considered  job  attitudes
(e.g.  job  satisfaction,  organisational  commitment,  job  involvement)  to  be
important  antecedents  and  correlates  of  such  work-related  phenomena  as
absenteeism,  turnover,  motivation,  and  performance  (e.g.  Brown,  1996;
Iaffaldano  &  Muchinsky,  1985;  Mathieu  &  Zajac,  1990).  Although
researchers have examined many situational predictors of job attitudes (e.g.
supervisory behaviors and work climate), a growing body of research in the
past two decades has suggested that dispositional variables (e.g. personality)
also predict job attitudes (e.g. Judge & Hulin, 1993; Staw, Bell, & Clausen,
1986;  Staw  &  Ross,  1985).  In  addition,  several  researchers  have  suggested
that general and work-speciﬁc aspects of the self-concept can help to further
our understanding of individual differences in job attitudes (e.g. Gardner
& Pierce, 1998; Judge, Locke, & Durham, 1997; Pierce, Gardner, Cummings,
& Dunham, 1989; Saks, 1995). Furthermore, work by Spector (1982, 1986)
showed  employees’  locus  of  control  to  be  an  important  predictor  of  job
attitudes.

Despite the growing body of work focusing on the relationships between
individual differences and job attitudes, relatively little is known about how
combinations of different individual difference are related to employees’ job
attitudes.  Moreover,  not  enough  is  known  about  how  dispositional  indi-
vidual differences and contextual aspects of the workplace in combination
relate to job attitudes. Accordingly, the purpose of this research was to test
a model of relationships among general and work-speciﬁc self-evaluations,
work-related  control  beliefs,  and  job  attitudes  (see  Fig.  1).  In  the  sections
that  follow,  we  describe  these  constructs  and  delineate  the  hypothesised
relationships among them.

JOB ATTITUDES

The  most  frequently  studied  job  attitudes  are  job  satisfaction,  organisa-
tional  commitment,  and  job  involvement  (e.g.  Dipboye,  Smith,  &  Howell,
1994).  Job  satisfaction  is  an  attitudinal  variable  assessing  how  people  feel

about their job or aspects of their job (Spector, 1997). Though researchers
have examined both separate facets of job satisfaction (e.g. Smith, Kendall,
& Hulin, 1969) and global (or overall) job satisfaction (e.g. Quinn & Shepard,
1974),  meta-analytic  ﬁndings  showed  that  overall  job  satisfaction  predicts
overall job performance better than individual job satisfaction components
(Iaffaldano & Muchinsky, 1985). Further, Judge et al. (Judge, Locke, Durham,
& Kluger, 1998b; Judge, Thoresen, Pucik, & Welbourne, 1999; Judge & Bono,
2001) showed that self-evaluations positively relate to global job satisfaction.
Thus, we focus on global job satisfaction.

Organisational  commitment  is  an  employee’s  attachment  to  his  or  her
organisation.  Allen  and  Meyer  (1990)  distinguished  among  three  types  of
organisational commitment—affective commitment (i.e. commitment based
on emotional attachment to and psychological identiﬁcation with the organ-
isation), continuance commitment (i.e. commitment based on perceived costs
associated with leaving the organisation or a lack of viable alternatives),
and normative commitment (i.e. commitment based on a strong sense of
obligation  to  the  organisation).  Affective  organisational  commitment  is
conceptually more similar to job satisfaction than are either continuance
commitment  or  normative  commitment,  in  that  it  has  a  stronger  affective
component.  Furthermore,  when  compared  to  continuance  commitment
and  normative  commitment,  affective  commitment  has  yielded  higher
correlations with antecedents, correlates, and consequences of other job atti-
tudes (Allen & Meyer, 1996; Mathieu & Zajac, 1990). Therefore, our study
focuses on affective organisational commitment.

Job  involvement  reﬂects  a  person’s  psychological  attachment  to  and
identiﬁcation  with  his  or  her  job  (Brown,  1996;  Kanungo,  1982).  Job
involvement  is  different  from  affective  organisational  commitment  in  that
job  involvement  reﬂects  attachment  to  a  job,  whereas  affective  organisa-
tional  commitment  reﬂects  attachment  to  an  organisation  (Brown,  1996).
Meta-analyses by Brown (1996) and Mathieu and Zajac (1990) found that
the  three  job  attitudes,  job  satisfaction,  organisational  commitment,  and
job  involvement,  are  strongly  related.  Although  Mathieu  and  Farr  (1991)
demonstrated that these attitudes are distinct constructs, Mathieu and Zajac
(1990,  p.  183)  suggested  that  the  high  intercorrelations  among  them  may
stem, in part, “from shared linkages at a more abstract conceptual level in
the nomological network”.

GENERAL SELF-EVALUATIONS

General self-evaluations refer to how individuals evaluate their own capab-
ilities and worth across different life domains and situations. General self-
evaluations are important components of Judge et al.’s (1997) theory of core
evaluations. In core evaluations theory, Judge and his colleagues provide a
taxonomy  of  personality  traits  that  capture  people’s  evaluations  of  them-
selves, their world, and their reality. Speciﬁcally, these authors suggest that
general  self-efﬁcacy,  global  self-esteem,  locus  of  control,  and  neuroticism
capture  people’s  evaluations  of  themselves  (i.e.  core  self-evaluations),  and
that core self-evaluations positively relate to job attitudes, motivation, and
performance.

In this study, we focus on general self-efﬁcacy  and  global self-esteem  as
the major components of general self-evaluations. We do not include locus
of control and neuroticism as components of general self-evaluations for the
following reasons. First, as we discuss in a later section, locus of control has
been conceptualised as both a self-evaluation construct (e.g. Levenson, 1981)
and as a world-view construct (e.g. Spector, 1988), indicating some confusion
about the nature of the construct. Locus of control has been conceptualised
 control events in their lives
as a person’s evaluation of whether 
(i.e. a world-view), as well as a person’s evaluation of whether 
 controls
events in her/his life (i.e. a self-evaluation). Second, studies by Judge and his
colleagues (Erez & Judge, 2001; Judge & Bono, 2001; Judge, Erez, & Bono,
1998a;  Judge,  Locke  et  al.,  1998b)  have  consistently  found  that  general
self-efﬁcacy and global self-esteem loaded more strongly on the higher-order
core  evaluations  factor  than  did  locus  of  control  or  neuroticism.  In  sum,
although general self-efﬁcacy, self-esteem, locus of control, and neuroticism
are all included in the Judge et al. model of core evaluations, general self-
efﬁcacy  and  self-esteem  are  more  consistent  with  our  deﬁnition  of  general
self-evaluations than are either locus of control or neuroticism.

Several authors (Chen, Gully, & Eden, 2001; Eden, 1988; Gardner & Pierce,
1998) argue that, although general self-efﬁcacy and global self-esteem are
highly similar constructs, they represent distinct ﬁrst-order constructs. Spe-
ciﬁcally, general self-efﬁcacy is a more motivational form of self-evaluation,
whereas global self-esteem is a more affective form of self-evaluation. Chen,
Gully, Whiteman, and Kilcullen (2000) deﬁned general self-efﬁcacy as “indi-
vidual  differences  in  people’s  tendency  to  view  themselves  as  capable  of
meeting task demands in a wide variety of situations” (p. 838). In contrast,
global self-esteem is deﬁned as “the overall affective evaluation of one’s own
worth, value, or importance” (Blascovich & Tomaka, 1991, p. 115). Indeed,
Chen,  Gully,  and  Eden  (2004)  demonstrated  that  (a)  compared  to  global
self-esteem, general self-efﬁcacy more strongly relates to motivational con-
structs and processes, and (b) compared to general self-efﬁcacy, global self-
esteem more strongly relates to affective constructs and processes.

Although  there  is  evidence  that  general  self-evaluations  signiﬁcantly
relate to job attitudes (e.g. Judge & Bono, 2001), general self-evaluations are
distal constructs (cf. Kanfer, 1992), in that they inﬂuence speciﬁc attitudes
and behaviors through more proximal, context-speciﬁc constructs and pro-
cesses. Speciﬁcally, employees who evaluate themselves as worthy and com-
petent in general (i.e. have high general self-efﬁcacy and global self-esteem)
are  also  likely  to  evaluate  themselves  as  worthy  and  competent  in  speciﬁc
contexts  (e.g.  work-contexts).  This  is  because  general  self-evaluations  tend
to  “cascade  down”  into  speciﬁc  life  domains  and  situations,  and  because
general  self-evaluations  inﬂuence  how  employees  react  in  particular  work
situations (e.g. Chen et al., 2000; Eden, 1988; Gardner & Pierce, 1998). In
turn, context-speciﬁc (i.e. work-speciﬁc) self-evaluations may then be direct
predictors of job attitudes.

WORK-SPECIFIC SELF-EVALUATIONS

Work-speciﬁc self-evaluations reﬂect how people evaluate their own capab-
ilities and worth as workers in their speciﬁc organisations, and include job
self-efﬁcacy  and  organisation-based  self-esteem.  Consistent  with  Bandura
(1997),  we  deﬁne  job  self-efﬁcacy  as  a  person’s  belief  that  he  or  she  can
perform  his  or  her  job  well.  Organisation-based  self-esteem  is  deﬁned  as
“the self-perceived value that individuals have of themselves as organization
members acting within an organisational context” (Pierce et al., 1989, p. 625).
We  expected  that  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations  would  exhibit  a  positive
relationship with job attitudes, because workers who evaluate themselves as
competent and worthy at work are more likely to have positive experiences
at  work  (e.g.  promotions,  raises)  than  those  who  evaluate  themselves
poorly, given that positive work-speciﬁc self-evaluations facilitate allocation
of  work-related  effort  and  persistence  (e.g.  Chen  et  al.,  2000;  Gardner  &

CHEN ET AL.

Pierce, 1998). Moreover, work-speciﬁc self-evaluations reﬂect the extent to
which employees are well adjusted at work, and better adjusted employees
are likely to have more positive job attitudes (e.g. Saks, 1995). Indeed, research
has shown that job self-efﬁcacy and organisation-based self-esteem strongly
and positively relate to job attitudes (Gardner & Pierce, 1998; Jex & Bliese,
1999; Mathieu & Zajac, 1990; Pierce et al., 1989; Saks, 1995).

Judge et al. (1998b, 1999) found that general self-evaluations relate to job
attitudes both directly and through such mechanisms as coping with organ-
isational  change.  However,  other  authors  have  found  that  general  self-
evaluations inﬂuence behaviors and attitudes primarily through more speciﬁc
forms of self-evaluations (e.g. Gardner & Pierce, 1998). The latter ﬁndings
suggest that the relationship of general self-evaluations with job attitudes is
at least partially explained by the fact that general self-evaluations translate
into more context-speciﬁc forms of self-evaluations (e.g. Eden, 1988). Hence,
we expected that work-speciﬁc self-evaluations would mediate the relationship
between general self-evaluations and job attitudes.

WORK-RELATED CONTROL BELIEFS

his or her own control

Control beliefs (e.g. locus of control) are beliefs about the degree to which
outcomes  and  reinforcements  are  controllable  (e.g.  Rotter,  1966;  Skinner,
1995).  Locus  of  control  can  be  considered  as  a  self-evaluation  construct
when  examining  whether  an  individual  believes  outcomes  and  reinforce-
ments are within 
. Alternatively, locus of control can
be conceptualised as a world-view construct when focusing on whether indi-
viduals believe outcomes and reinforcements are within the 
control of people
. Locus of control as a self-evaluation is more consistent concep-
in general
tually  with  one’s  self-concept,  whereas  locus  of  control  as  a  world-view  is
more consistent with one’s evaluation of a particular context (or contexts in
general).  Examination  of  items  from  popular  locus  of  control  measures
illustrates  that  research  to  date  has  not  clearly  delineated  the  theoretical
distinction between locus of control as a world-view and locus of control as
self-evaluation. Items from the Rotter (1966) I-E Scale tap locus of control
both  as  a  general  world-view  (e.g.  “People’s  misfortunes  result  from  the
mistakes they make”, “People are lonely because they don’t try to be friendly”)
and as a general self-evaluation (e.g. “In my case, getting what I want has
little  or  nothing  to  do  with  luck”,  “Many  times  I  feel  that  I  have  little
inﬂuence over the things that happen to me”). Levenson’s (1981) Internality
Scale assesses locus of control exclusively as a self-evaluation construct
(e.g. “My life is determined by my own actions”). Spector’s (1988) context-

speciﬁc Work Locus of Control Scale can be considered a purely world-view
measure (e.g. “A job is what you make of it”, “Getting the job you want is
mostly a matter of luck”).

Similar to self-efﬁcacy and self-esteem, locus of control is both a generalised
belief and a context-speciﬁc belief (e.g. Spector, 1988). The current investiga-
tion examined context-speciﬁc control beliefs conceptualised as world-views
(i.e. work-related control beliefs). Context-speciﬁc control beliefs are similar
.  Karoly  (1993,  p.  41)
to  Karoly’s  (1993)  notion  of 
deﬁnes operational boundaries as “theoretical salient or plausible limits on
the realization of self-regulation”, and argues that “individuals [cannot] be
expected to persist in goal-directed behavior in the face of powerful counter-
inﬂuences by signiﬁcant others”. Simply put, operational boundaries are
perceptions of how controllable outcomes and reinforcements are within a
particular context, such as a work environment.

operational  boundaries

Work-related control beliefs include work locus of control and organisa-
tional locus of control. Work locus of control is a belief that people control
outcomes at work, such as promotions, layoffs, and salary levels. Organisa-
tional locus of control, deﬁned as one’s belief that employees of a particular
organisation  control  their  outcomes  in  that  organisation,  is  more  context-
speciﬁc than work locus of control. We expect organisational locus of control
to be highly related to work locus of control, as beliefs regarding how much
control workers in general have are strongly related to beliefs regarding how
much control workers have in their particular organisation.

Work-related control beliefs capture an important aspect of the work context
that is likely to impact work-speciﬁc self-evaluation and job attitudes.
Consistent with Karoly (1993), we expected that work-related control beliefs
would positively correlate with work-speciﬁc self-evaluations, because people
are  more  likely  to  achieve  goals  in  controllable  task  environments  than  in
uncontrollable task environments. Therefore, workers who believe that their
work environment is such that work-related outcomes (e.g. promotions and
raises)  are  determined  by  employee  behaviors,  rather  than  by  external
factors,  are  likely  to  have  higher  job  self-efﬁcacy  and  organisation-based
self-esteem.  Indeed,  research  has  shown  that  perceived  environmental
controllability  has  a  positive  impact  on  self-efﬁcacy  (Wood  &  Bandura,
1989). In addition, employees are likely to feel valued in work contexts that
allow them to make a difference.

We  expect  that  work-related  control  beliefs  will  be  positively  related  to
job  attitudes.  A  meta-analysis  by  Spector  (1986)  found  that  levels  of
perceived control were positively related to job satisfaction, organisational
commitment,  and  job  involvement.  Also,  work  locus  of  control  has  been
found  to  be  positively  associated  with  both  job  satisfaction  and  affective
organisational  commitment  (Irving,  Coleman,  &  Cooper,  1997).  We  con-
tend that work-related control beliefs relate to job attitudes at least in part

CHEN ET AL.

because  of  their  positive  relationship  with  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations,
given that work-speciﬁc self-evaluations are more proximal to job attitudes
than  are  work-related  control  beliefs.  Speciﬁcally,  the  psychological
reactions  to  the  work  context  (reﬂected  by  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations)
are likely to have stronger relationships with job attitudes than the charac-
teristics of work themselves (cf. Hackman & Oldham, 1976).

Hypothesis 2
work-related control beliefs and job attitudes.

: Work-speciﬁc self-evaluations mediate the relationships between

Consistent with Karoly (1993) and Vroom (1964), we propose that the degree
to which workers perceive outcomes at work as controllable moderates the
relationship  of  general  self-evaluations  with  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations.
When a work context is perceived as low on work and organisational locus
of control (i.e. when the “operational boundaries” at work are perceived to
be limited), employees are likely to feel low organisation-based self-esteem
and  job  self-efﬁcacy  irrespective  of  whether  they  have  high  or  low  general
self-evaluations, given that their personal resources and effort would make
little  difference  in  such  contexts.  In  contrast,  in  work  contexts  perceived
as  highly  controllable,  differences  in  general  self-evaluations  are  likely  to
strongly and positively relate to work-speciﬁc self-evaluations, because
allocations of personal resources and effort could make a real difference in
such contexts.

Hypothesis 3
: Work-related control beliefs moderate the relationships between
general self-evaluations and work-speciﬁc self-evaluations, such that the relation-
ships  between  general  self-evaluations  and  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations  are
low when work-related control beliefs are low, but these relationships become
more positive as levels of work-related control beliefs increase.

METHOD

Sample and Procedure
One  hundred  and  sixty-ﬁve  ﬁrst-line  employees  from  two  departments
(Customer Service and Claims) in a large health maintenance organisation
in the Eastern United States were asked to complete the measures as a part of
a larger work climate survey initiated by the organisation’s top management.
Participants  were  granted  full  conﬁdentiality  and  participation  was  fully
voluntary. The survey was group-administered (10–30 employees at a time)
during  work  hours.  For  their  participation,  employees  received  pizza  and
soft  drinks.  Average  age  of  employees  was  42  years,  94%  were  African
American women, average tenure of employees was 5.3 years, and average
education  level  was  12.3  years.  Employees  from  the  two  departments  did

Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis of Scales
We  conducted  conﬁrmatory  factor  analyses  in  LISREL  8  (Joreskog  &
Sorbom, 1993) to test further the validity of the measures. Consistent with
Williams and Anderson (1994), we created three parcels of randomly chosen
items for each of the constructs. As shown in Table 1, the proposed model,
in  which  general  self-efﬁcacy,  global  self-esteem,  work  locus  of  control,
organisational  locus  of  control,  job  self-efﬁcacy,  organisation-based  self-
esteem, job satisfaction, organisational commitment, and job involvement were

control beliefs, and job attitudes are sufﬁciently distinct. In sum, the CFA
tests  supported  the  construct  validity  of  the  measures.  Additional  results
from the conﬁrmatory factor analyses (e.g. factor loadings and factor cor-
relations) can be obtained on request from the ﬁrst author.

RESULTS

Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations among the variables are reported
in  Table  2.  As  expected,  high  and  signiﬁcant  (p  <  .01)  correlations  were
obtained between general self-efﬁcacy and global self-esteem (r = .58), work
locus of control and organisational locus of control (r = .52), job self-efﬁcacy
and organisation-based self-esteem (r = .54), job involvement and job satis-
faction (r = .39), job involvement and organisational commitment (r = .52),
and job satisfaction and organisational commitment (r = .66). However, as
reported earlier, measures of these constructs were sufﬁciently distinct.

Tests of Hypotheses 1 and 2
Hypotheses 1 and 2 propose that work-speciﬁc self-evaluations mediate the
relationships between general self-evaluations and job attitudes and between
work-related  control  beliefs  and  job  attitudes.  Kenny,  Kashy,  and  Bolger
(1998) propose that four criteria must be met to support mediation. First,
the  independent  variable  needs  to  be  related  to  the  dependent  variable.
Note, however, that Kenny et al. (1998) argued that this relationship could
be weak or even non-signiﬁcant in cases where the independent variable has
a more distal (or indirect) inﬂuence on the dependent variable, a situation
Kenny  et  al.  termed  distal  mediation.  Second,  the  independent  variable
needs to be related to the mediator. Third, the mediator must be related to
the dependent variable with the independent variable included in the model.
The ﬁnal criterion for supporting a mediated relationship requires that the
relationship  between  the  independent  variable  and  the  criterion  variable
disappear  (i.e.  become  non-signiﬁcant)  when  controlling  for  the  mediator
variable.  If  the  relationship  between  the  independent  variable  and  the  cri-
terion variable is lowered, but remains signiﬁcant, when controlling for the
mediator variable, the data are consistent with partial mediation.

Tables  2  and  3  show  results  from  the  mediation  analyses  used  to  test
Hypothesis  1.  First,  as  shown  in  Table  2,  general  self-evaluations  (the
independent  variables)  generally  did  not  relate  to  the  dependent  variables
(job  attitudes),  with  the  exception  of  one  signiﬁcant  relationship  (general
self-efﬁcacy and job satisfaction). Second, as expected, Table 2 indicates that
general  self-evaluations  (both  general  self-efﬁcacy  and  global  self-esteem)
positively  and  signiﬁcantly  correlated  with  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations
(both job self-efﬁcacy and organisation-based self-esteem). Third, as shown

in  Table  3,  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations  generally  predicted  job  attitudes
over  and  above  general  self-evaluations.  However,  whereas  organisation-
based  self-esteem  was  found  to  signiﬁcantly  predict  all  three  job  attitudes
over and above general self-evaluations, job self-efﬁcacy uniquely predicted
job  satisfaction,  but  not  organisational  commitment  and  job  involvement.
Finally,  the  relationship  between  general  self-efﬁcacy  and  job  satisfaction
became non-signiﬁcant once including the mediators (i.e. work-speciﬁc self-
evaluations) in the model (Table 3, steps#2). In several cases the coefﬁcients
associated  with  general  self-evaluations  switched  signs,  and  even  became
signiﬁcant  in  one  case,  when  including  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations  in
the  model.  These  results  are  indicative  of  suppression,1  given  that  general

1 Additional mediation tests in which only one predictor and one mediator were examined
at a time yielded highly similar results to those reported in Table 3, suggesting that our results
were a function of suppression, and not multicollinearity.

self-evaluations  generally  did  not  relate  to  job  attitudes,  but  did  relate  to
work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations  (Pedhazur,  1997).  Thus,  results  provided
support  for  Hypothesis  1,  in  that  general  self-evaluations  predicted  job
attitudes indirectly through work-speciﬁc self-evaluations, primarily through
organisation-based self-esteem.

Tables 2 and 4 summarise results from the mediation analyses used to test
Hypothesis 2. First, both work locus of control and organisational locus
of  control  signiﬁcantly  related  to  job  satisfaction  and  organisational  com-
mitment,  but  not  to  job  involvement  (see  Table  2).  Second,  work  locus  of
control signiﬁcantly related to both job self-efﬁcacy and organisation-based
self-esteem, whereas organisational locus of control related to organisation-
based  self-esteem,  but  not  to  job  self-efﬁcacy.  Third,  Table  4  shows  that
organisation-based self-esteem, but not job self-efﬁcacy, predicted all three
job attitudes over and above work-related control beliefs. Finally, the rela-
tionships between work-related control beliefs and job attitudes were lower

when  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations  were  included  in  the  model  (Table  4,
steps#2), but organisational locus of control remained a signiﬁcant pre-
dictor  of  job  satisfaction  and  organisational  commitment  after  controlling
for work-speciﬁc self-evaluations. In sum, these results provide some support
for  Hypothesis  2.  Speciﬁcally,  organisation-based  self-esteem,  but  not  job
self-efﬁcacy, fully mediated the relationships between work locus of control
and  job  attitudes,  and  partially  mediated  the  relationships  between  organ-
isational  locus  of  control  and  job  attitudes.  Taken  together,  results  also
showed that, among all the predictors, organisation-based self-esteem is the
strongest, most proximal predictor of all three job attitudes.

Tests of Hypothesis 3
Hypothesis  3  proposes  that  work-related  control  beliefs  moderate  the
relationships  between  general  self-evaluations  and  work-speciﬁc  self-
evaluations.  To  test  Hypothesis  3,  we  conducted  hierarchical  moderated
regression analyses, as recommended by Aiken and West (1991). These
analyses  involved  regressing  each  dependent  variable  (job  self-efﬁcacy  or
organisation-based self-esteem) on each independent variable (general self-
efﬁcacy or global self-esteem) and each moderator variable (work locus of
control or organisational locus of control) at a ﬁrst step, and on each respect-
ive interaction term (e.g. general self-efﬁcacy × work locus of control) at
a second step. Next, Aiken and West (1991) suggested a procedure to plot
signiﬁcant interaction terms, which allows researchers to better interpret the
nature of the interaction (i.e. the nature of the moderated relationship).

Table  5  summarises  results  from  the  hierarchical  moderated  regression
analyses. Of interest are results from step#2 across the analyses (i.e. tests of
the partial coefﬁcient of the interaction terms). Results indicated that work-
related  control  beliefs  (both  work  and  organisational  locus  of  control)
moderated  the  relationships  of  general  self-evaluations  (both  general  self-
efﬁcacy  and  self-esteem)  with  organisation-based  self-esteem,  but  not  with
job self-efﬁcacy. Results were highly consistent, with signiﬁcant interaction
terms in three, and marginally signiﬁcant in one of four analyses involving
organisation-based self-esteem. Moreover, the nature of the detected interac-
tions was consistent across the four analyses involving organisation-based
self-esteem, as reﬂected by the similar b-coefﬁcients of the four interaction
terms.  To  help  interpret  these  interactions,  we  plotted  one  of  the  interac-
tions from Table 5 (see Fig. 2). Figure 2 demonstrates that the relationship
between  global  self-esteem  and  organisation-based  self-esteem  was  weak
when  work  locus  of  control  was  low,  and  strong  and  positive  when  work
locus  of  control  was  high,  providing  support  for  Hypothesis  3.  The  same
type  of  interaction  was  detected  in  the  other  three  analyses  involving
organisation-based  self-esteem.  In  short,  the  data  are  consistent  with  the

between general self-evaluations and work-speciﬁc self-evaluations.

notion that work-related control beliefs moderate the relationships between
general  self-evaluations  and  organisation-based  self-esteem,  but  do  not
moderate  the  relationships  between  general  self-evaluations  and  job
self-efﬁcacy.

DISCUSSION

This  study  extends  previous  work  on  job  attitudes  by  delineating  the
relationships  among  individual  differences  (general  and  work-speciﬁc  self-
evaluations),  contextual  variables  (work-related  control  beliefs),  and  job
attitudes.  The  best  predictor  of  job  attitudes  was  organisation-based  self-
esteem. Thus, our study suggests that job attitudes are more related to how
employees feel about their worth at work (i.e. organisation-based self-esteem)
than  to  how  employees  estimate  their  competence  at  work  (i.e.  job  self-
efﬁcacy). Results are consistent with the notion that more affective forms of
self-evaluations predict affective outcomes (e.g. job attitudes) better than more
cognitive forms of self-evaluations, such as self-efﬁcacy (Chen et al., 2001,
2004). However, given that self-efﬁcacy also includes affective components
(e.g.  Bandura,  1997),  and  job  attitudes  also  include  cognitive  components

CHEN ET AL.

(e.g.  Brief  &  Robertson,  1989),  self-efﬁcacy  is  likely  to  relate  (albeit  to  a
lesser extent than organisation-based self-esteem) to job attitudes.

We also extended Judge et al.’s (1997) core evaluations theory by showing
that  general  self-evaluations  relate  to  context-speciﬁc  self-evaluations,  and
by delineating some boundary conditions for these relationships. Consistent with
Karoly (1993), we showed that the extent to which general self-evaluations
relate to context-speciﬁc self-evaluations depends on context-speciﬁc control
beliefs, but only when considering one aspect of work-speciﬁc self-evaluation
(organisation-based self-esteem). Thus, how employees evaluate themselves
in  general  may  or  may  not  translate  into  how  valued  they  feel  at  work,
depending on how controllable employees perceive their workplace to be (e.g.
in terms of obtaining promotions, being laid off, etc.). However, unlike Judge
et  al.,  we  did  not  ﬁnd  direct  relationships  between  general  self-evaluations
and job attitudes. Instead, general self-evaluations only indirectly related to
job attitudes, through work-speciﬁc self-evaluations.

The  ﬁndings  that  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations  help  explain  (at  least
in  part)  the  relationships  between  work-related  control  beliefs  and  job
attitudes  are  consistent  with  research  on  the  job  characteristics  model
(e.g.  Fried  &  Ferris,  1987;  Hackman  &  Oldham,  1976).  Speciﬁcally,  these
ﬁndings suggest that employees’ psychological reactions to work conditions
are  related  to  their  job  attitudes.  Thus,  interventions  that  increase  work-
related control beliefs and work-speciﬁc self-evaluations may show promise
as an effective strategy for improving job attitudes. To boost job attitudes,
managers  should  attempt  simultaneously  to  increase  internal  work-related
control  beliefs  and  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations.  Indeed,  expanding  em-
ployees’ perceived operational boundaries (i.e. work-related control beliefs)
would  likely  improve  employees’  work-speciﬁc  self-evaluations,  which  will
in turn enhance employees’ work motivation (Karoly, 1993).

It  is  important  to  note  that  this  study  is  based  on  a  single,  modest  and
homogeneous sample of employees, which may limit the generalisability of
our ﬁndings to other settings and populations. Thus, future research should
attempt to replicate and extend our ﬁndings in other organisational settings
and using different samples. Moreover, although we examined two import-
ant  general  self-evaluations  (general  self-efﬁcacy  and  global  self-esteem),
future research should extend our ﬁndings by examining additional general
self-evaluations (i.e. general locus of control, neuroticism).

More work is needed to extend the theoretical distinctions among various
forms of self-evaluations and world-views. For instance, additional research
needs  to  examine  whether  self-evaluation  control  beliefs  are  distinct  from
world-view  control  beliefs,  and  whether  such  theoretical  distinctions  have
practical implications. In the current study we found that work-speciﬁc self-
evaluations partially mediate the relationship of work-related control beliefs
with job attitudes. It remains to be tested whether similar relationships exist

In  addition,  it  would  be  useful  to  examine  the  degree  to  which  context-
speciﬁc  self-evaluations  and  world-views  are  malleable,  and,  therefore,
could be easily increased by organisational and managerial interventions.

Future research should also test the processes through which self-evaluations
and  control  beliefs  relate  to  important  organisational  outcomes  at  various
levels of speciﬁcity. This study and previous research (e.g. Chen et al.,
2000; Gardner  &  Pierce,  1998;  Phillips  &  Gully,  1997)  have  shown  that
general  self-evaluations  (as  well  as  other  general  individual  differences)
relate  to  context-speciﬁc  outcomes  primarily  through  context-speciﬁc  pro-
cesses  and  variables.  However,  results  from  this  study  and  Chen  et  al.
(2001,  2004)  suggest  that  different  general  core  evaluations  may  relate  to
speciﬁc outcomes through different speciﬁc processes and variables (e.g.
cognitive  vs.  affective).  It  may  also  be  that  more  general  self-evaluations
directly inﬂuence more general outcomes, and that, over time, context-speciﬁc
self-evaluations  accumulate  to  inﬂuence  more  general  self-evaluations
(Rosenberg, Schooler, Schoenbach, & Rosenberg, 1995). Finally, researchers
should examine the relative inﬂuence of core evaluation constructs on such
outcomes as job attitudes and job performance compared to other individual
differences (e.g. cognitive ability) and situational factors (e.g. supervisor sup-
port, nature of the job).
