ABSTRACT. According to the Dutch Ministry of
Economic Affairs (2001), transparency by means of Sus-
tainability Reporting should lead to better Corporate
Social Responsibility (CSR) performance of companies.
Sustainability Reporting should also give consumers the
information they need to purchase the most sustainable
products available (Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs,
2004). This article analyses the driving factors influencing
CSR and Sustainability Reporting at seven breweries in
the Netherlands. It also gives a better understanding of
organizational behaviour with reference to CSR and the
reasons breweries have for Sustainability Reporting. The
Dutch government has no intention of forcing organi-
zations to publish a sustainability report, since it is trying
to diminish the volume of legislation. Rather, the gov-
ernment prefers to rely on the willingness and initiatives
of organizations to make CSR a success. In 2006, the
Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs will evaluate the
effect of
its CSR policy. But is it a success already?
During our research, breweries appeared to find CSR
more important than Sustainability Reporting. Sustain-
ability reporting is, for most breweries, not the way to
reach stakeholders. Most stakeholders have their own
means
for receiving information e.g. annual reports,
meetings, public statements and press releases. Although
small breweries think CSR is very important, they feel
no pressure from outside to publish a sustainability re-
port. For them it is very complex and expensive to
publish a sustainability report. Large breweries
feel
pressure from many stakeholders to be transparent, but
not on a regular basis. We conclude from this research
that CSR does not stimulate Sustainability Reporting,
but neither does Sustainability Reporting stimulate
CSR.

Introduction

History of CSR

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a century
old concept. In the ﬁrst decades of the 20th century,
companies were expected to interfere in social
matters of their employees like housing and health
security (SER, 2003). Slowly, government
took
over the social choirs of the companies, and com-
panies evolved into ﬁnancially orientated organiza-
tions. But the consequences of this narrow corporate
focus were visible in the 70s and 80s of the last
century, when the negative environmental conse-
quences of our rapid industrial growth appeared and
had to be solved (SER, 2003; Willems, 2003).
Besides
social
involvement of companies was no longer obvious
and came under pressure. A rise in social security,
professionalism,
and
work and double incomes in households (which
leave less
time for volunteer work), companies
became more commercial (MVO Platform 2002;
SER, 2003; Willems, 2003). Globalization caused
the environmental and social problems to grow from
a local to a worldwide level. Companies should have
had a sustainable strategy policy for these matters,
because they caused social, ecological and economic
problems (so-called triple P); companies also have
the means to do something about these problems

(Elkington, 1997). According to the Brundtland-
deﬁnition, CSR would contribute to diminishing
world problems affecting sustainable development1
(Elkington, 1997; WCED, 1987).

They are also already familiar with CSR and Sus-
tainability Reporting, which makes them relatively
easy to interview. We used a narrative interview
method (episodic interviewing) to get new infor-
mation not available in the literature.

Different reporting methods

Article structure

Companies should be open about their CSR activities
(Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs (EZ), 2001).
This means that organizations should inform persons
who wish to receive information (Global Reporting
). There are different ways to spread
Initiative, 2002
information. For example, the government receives
information through compulsory reporting, share-
holders receive information through annual reports or
meetings, and NGOs and the media receive infor-
mation through discussions, interviews or press re-
leases. According to EZ, inhabitants should receive
information through a sustainability report. Assuming
that organizations are free to decide if they want to
publish a sustainability report or not, we will focus on
one central issue here, i.e.: What are the driving factors
inﬂuencing Sustainability Reporting? By comparing
breweries that have a sustainability report with those
which do not, we have done an analysis to ascertain
what factors play an important role in the discussion
on whether to publish a sustainability report.

Method

The Dutch government wishes to stimulate com-
panies to voluntarily monitor the effects of their
activities (EZ, 2001). According to EZ, transparency
should even lead to better CSR performances (Good
Company, 2003) because consumers and customers
are able to decide which product is the most sus-
tainable (EZ, 2004). Since EZ focus on the inﬂuence
of consumers, only sustainability reports available via
Internet were analyzed in this research, considering
the accessibility of Internet for inhabitants.

Several driving factors are analyzed. To get con-
sistent insight, differentiation in motivation because
of product and production diversiﬁcation is ex-
cluded by focusing the research on one line of
business. Breweries were the chosen topic here be-
cause their products and production processes are
relatively easy to compare, and because they are
different in sizes and form a relatively small branch.

The aim of this research is to gain more insight into
how publishing a sustainability report would make
breweries transparent in their CSR behaviour. To do
this we start with an overview on what is meant by
CSR and sustainability reporting, going on in the
section on method to the factors driving the research
and to methodology (the episodic interview meth-
od). This is followed by the results and conclusions.

CSR

Organizations have different approaches to CSR.
Garriga and Mele´ (2004) and Quazi and O’Brien
(2000) have already discussed different types of CSR
in other editions of this journal. The broad range of
CSR makes it possible for organizations to create a
CSR vision that corresponds to the particular chal-
lenges they have to face and their unique position
(Van Marrewijk, 2003). Seven aspects of CSR have
been distinguished, arising from several
studies.
These aspects reﬂect the wide coverage of CSR. In
this research, CSR is deﬁned as ‘‘a company’s obli-
gation to act on issues
to be
important, going further than law requires them to
do and being accountable for all its actions effecting
social, environmental and economic areas’’. This
deﬁnition is based on the CSR deﬁnition introduced
by SER (SER, 2000).

society considers

The following aspects are important for organi-

zations actively involved in CSR:

Triple P

The triple P, or People Proﬁt, Planet is a well-
known aspect of CSR. It forces repositioning of
strategies from proﬁt-driven organizations to orga-
nizations with attention for the companies inﬂuence
on social and environmental aspects (Dawkins and
Stewart, 2003; Kim and Van Dam, 2003; Van

Marrewijk, 2003) and the Social Economic Council
in the Netherlands (SER, 2000).

Long-term basis

Value creation

Value creation is closely related to Triple P (Hoe-
venagel, 2004; SER, 2000). It does not focus on
proﬁt maximalization from the (neo-)classical per-
spective, where social and environmental responsi-
bilities are unnecessary, but on value creation within
the domain of CSR, where three types of value
creation are required.

Bergmans (2003) and Kim and Van Dam (2003)
focus particularly on the ﬁnancial consequences of
CSR, and do not pay much attention to the effects
ecological value creation can have on the environ-
ment. This could give the impression that CSR is
cost-reducing. This is possible, but, as this article will
show, not guaranteed,
since the cost reduction
cannot always be expressed in ﬁnancial results.

Stakeholders

The (neo-)classical perspective focuses only on the
opinion of the shareholders (Remkes, 2002). CSR
does not only cater to the desires of the shareholders,
but allows other stakeholders to play a signiﬁcant
role. Stakeholders have a lot of power, which gives
them a positive inﬂuence on the CSR policies of
organizations (Dawkins and Stewart, 2003).

The SER (2000) and Dawkins and Stewart (2003)
distinguish stakeholders
into primary or internal
stakeholders (employees, stakeholders), and other or
external stakeholders (customers, suppliers etc.).

The SER (2000) characterizes

the
cooperation is to function well, it is important to
balance the pros and cons of different (conﬂicting)
needs of stakeholders. The organization has to meet
the precondition of being a paying concern and be
willing to go further than legislation, contracts,
rules etc., prescribing and paying attention to the
topics society considers to be valuable (Dawkins
and Stewart, 2003; RIVM, 2004; SER, 2000).

Corporate Social Responsibility has an effect on core
competences of
the organization (Hoevenagel,
2004). According to the Ministry of Economic Af-
fairs in the Netherlands (EZ), an organization shows
Corporate Social Responsibility when, during the
operational management, it displays social and eco-
logical effects of the activities of the organization and
is willing to take full responsibility (EZ, 2001). One
of the consequences is a long-term focus on CSR, in
contrast to the annual and even quarterly ﬁnancial
reports most companies are used to focusing on. To
achieve this, corporate embedment is necessary to
keep the focus on all the aspects of CSR.

Ultimate responsibility for suppliers and customers

Corporate Social Responsibility extends to suppliers,
accepters, licensees or joint ventures and everybody
that works for the company, regardless of formal
contracts, the nature of the product and location of
the company (MVO platform, 2002). Research
among Finnish companies conﬁrm that ultimate
responsibility is a part of CSR and that companies
should do everything in their power to stimulate the
entire chain to carry out CSR. But the same research
emphasizes that the companies interviewed do have
trouble realizing transparency in the chain (Panapa-
naan et al., 2003).

Transparency

Organizations should answer justiﬁed questions from
society and be open about their activities. There are
many options, such as lectures, Internet sites and
Sustainability Reporting. Stakeholders ask for open-
ness regarding considerations and results (Dawkins
and Stewart, 2003). Other research, however, con-
cludes that organizations get limited reactions to their
sustainability reports (Van der Ziel, 2003).

Sustainability reporting

Organizations can be transparent in many different
ways. Depending on who needs the information,
organizations decide or are compelled to deliver the


296

information. For example, management expects
evaluations of an organization’s performance. This
information can also be used to publish an annual
report for shareholders and write a press release for
the media. The Dutch government demands conﬁ-
dential environmental reporting.3 Citizens may ask
for understandable information. One way to provide
this then is to publish a sustainability report; this
form of transparency will be investigated below.

A sustainability report should cover all relevant
aspects of a company’s CSR. Since CSR covers a
wide range of topics, it is difﬁcult for organizations
to report all data necessary and available. To help
organizations with this difﬁcult
there are
various guidelines and systems to investigate rele-
vant aspects of CSR, the Global Reporting Ini-
tiative guidelines (GRI guidelines) being a one of
them.

task,

It

The GRI guidelines aim to contribute to the
continuous dialogue with stakeholders. The guide-
lines focus on a larger group of stakeholders than the
ﬁnancial report, where focus is solely on share-
holders. The guidelines should help to deliver the
information that stakeholders expect (GRI, 2002).

The GRI guidelines do not represent a code of
behaviour or a performance indicator, but aims to
give tools to report measures that are taken to im-
prove economic, social and ecological performances;
this is to compare the results of those measurements
and to compose strategies to improve. In this way,
GRI gives indicators for subscribing to the CSR
activities, like average hours of training per year per
employees.

Methods

Case study

Only breweries in the Netherlands with a com-
mercial production of over 10,000 hectolitres a year
were investigated. Nine breweries ﬁtted the criteria
for the research. Two are internationally operating
breweries (>50,000 employees) and two (ca. 900
employees) are breweries concentrating on the
Dutch market, either with foreign breweries or co-
operating with breweries licensed to brew their
brand. Besides these four larger breweries, there are

ﬁve smaller ones (<100 employees), which focus on
the Dutch market and have a limited export market
(See Table I).

Seven breweries were willing to co-operate. Four
of them (only the largest) publish an annual report,
ﬁtting the criteria of transparency for inhabitants.
One brewery publishes an environmental and social
report, and one a sustainability report. The sustain-
ability report had the most complete coverage of the
GRI guidelines. The GRI guidelines were used to
give an impression on how well breweries report on
their CSR activities. Which factors encourage
breweries to compile a sustainability report? The
next paragraph shows
the literature study that
revealed possible factors inﬂuencing Sustainability
Reporting.

Literature study: driving factors

Corporate Social Responsibility envelops a broad
range of topics. Although studies that try to explain
CSR and grasp its context of CSR were consulted,
there was still
little knowledge about the driving
factors behind Sustainability Reporting4 (Garriga
and Mele´, 2004; Graaﬂand and Eijfﬁnger, 2004;
Hoevenagel, 2004; SER, 2000). By comparing
driving factors behind Sustainability Reporting, the
GRI guidelines mention CSR driving factors from
the literature study. Here, it appeared that CSR and
Sustainability Reporting is inﬂuenced by the same
(Garriga and Mele´, 2004; Graaﬂand and
factors
Eijfﬁnger, 2004; GRI, 2002; Hoevenagel, 2004;
SER, 2000). Eventually, 15 factors, which might
inﬂuence Sustainability Reporting, were found
before the interview took place. There are different
factors. First, there are internal factors, factors inside
the organizations that have inﬂuence,
like man-
agement, employees and costs. Logically, CSR
should be a driver of social reporting, but it is not,
as this study shows. Second, there are the external
factors, the stakeholders (see a short description in
Table II).

These 15 factors give an impression of what fac-
tors may inﬂuence Sustainability Reporting. To
determine driving factors inﬂuencing breweries in
the Netherlands, we took semi-structured interviews
with CEOs and managers knowledgeable about the
CSR activities of the brewery.

Applied data sources

Interview method: narrative interviewing

We make a distinction between the various sources
of information:
information about CSR and sus-
tainability reports available on the internet, public
reports of CSR and sustainability activities, sent and
received comments of
the informants by e-mail
concerning the analyzed interviews.

We applied narrative interviewing (see next
chapter) and Computer-mediated communication
(CMC). One form of CMC is computer-mediated
asynchronous communication or CMAC. Asyn-
chronous communication, as mentioned above,
does not
involve instant replies: communicators
can decide to reply at any given moment (Benh-
unan-Fich et al., 2002). We optimized the reli-
the research results by using different
ability of
information and communication methods
and
means of communication to give the respondents
as much time as needed to reﬂect on their
responses.

The transparency of breweries was investigated after
the literature study. Only information easily available
for inhabitants on the Internet was used.

Before the interviews started, the available reports
on CSR activities of the brewery were carried out
and analysed using the Global Reporting Initiative
guidelines (GRI). After the reports were analyzed,
other information about CSR found on the Internet,
with extra information about CSR required by the
GRI guidelines, was added to the analysis. The CSR
activities of breweries without a report were analy-
zed by looking for information on the Internet.
Information required by the GRI guidelines, but not
available, was ﬁlled out in a list of questions for
during the interview. Therefore, for each brewery
unique questions were added to a so-called topic
guide. After ﬁnishing the topic guide was made,
we held an exploratory interview with the Cen-
tral Brewery ofﬁce (CBK), which looks after the

interests of all joint activities of the breweries. The
aim of this interview was to establish a view on what
CSR means for breweries and what aspects of CSR
are important for breweries. The CBK indicated that
especially alcohol abuse, energy and water are sub-
jects which are very important for breweries. This
information was added to the topic guide. After this
interview, seven interviews followed, with only two
out of the nine breweries not wanting to cooperate
(see Table I).

Due to diversity of CSR, a narrative interview
(the episodic interview) method was chosen to give
the informants the possibility of telling their own
story (Bauer and Gaskell, 2000). Managers and
CEOs presumably prefer to talk about their CSR
activities instead of ﬁlling in a questionnaire. To
make sure the interview focused on Sustainability
Reporting, the informants were guided by the topic
guide, which corresponds with the episodic inter-
view methodology. The advantages of this meth-
odology are that new insight can be discussed; it also
gives a better understanding of the context of the
informant and CSR. In this way, every interview
could be recorded and entirely written out.

The disadvantages of this method are that the
interviews are not the same and the discussion can
wander off the subject. This makes the topic guide,
already discussed, necessary (Bauer and Gaskell,
2000).

After the interview, all interviews were sent to the
informants to check the analysis of the interview,
and to question some topics if necessary, when they
were not made clear during the interview. However,
CSR is a sensitive subject – containing subjects
breweries sometimes do not want to discuss because
the performances are not good enough. Since one of
the interviewers was well-known with the activities
of breweries, it was possible to value the answers and
to make inquiries. Not a single interview had a
in fact, most inter-
‘‘question–answer’’ structure;
views were dialogues about driving factors
that
inﬂuence CSR and CSR reporting. Analysis of the
driving factors inﬂuencing Sustainability Reporting
was made by interpreting the interviews.

Besides the inquires during the interviews, we
also compared the corrections of the analysis of the
interview done by the informants with the sponta-
neous answers they gave during the interviews. By
comparing the spontaneous answers and the cor-

rections of the analysis of the interviews made by the
informants the researchers came to a well-considered
picture of the research results.

Due to the overload of information, these visions
on CSR and social reporting are analyzed and
compared as well. This allowed the context inﬂu-
encing the brewer’s interpretation on the impor-
tance of Sustainability Reporting to become clearer.
Tables are used to illustrate the analysis of the
interviews, making it possible to compare opinions
on the same subjects. One table (Table III) analyses
how breweries interpret CSR and one (Table IV)
analyses the driving factors inﬂuencing CSR and
sustainability reporting. In the end it appeared that
the same factors inﬂuenced CSR as Sustainability
Reporting.

they were familiar with. Therefore,

Due to the qualitative nature of the research, it is
difﬁcult to objectively wage the inﬂuence that a
factor has. The nature of the interviews requires
a subjective waging of the amount of inﬂuence a
factor has. Since the interviews were written out in
full, they were well-documented, with the infor-
mants only using demystifying examples about
topics
the
number and clarity of examples determined the
inﬂuence the factor had. A factor received ‘‘++’’,
when the informant indicated the factor to have a
very positive inﬂuence, including clear examples. A
factor received ‘‘+’’ when the informant declared
that
the
informant did not
spontaneously give examples
about this inﬂuence. The factor received ‘‘o’’ when
the factor did not have any inﬂuence, and ‘‘-’’ when
the factor had negative inﬂuence with no examples
given. This symbol, ‘‘–’’, was given to factors that
had a negative inﬂuence, with spontaneous and
vivid examples. The empty boxes indicate that no
answer was given to the question as to what extent
the factor concerned had inﬂuence, even after
questioning.

it had a positive inﬂuence; however,

Analysis and results

To answer the research questions, use has been made
of both theory and empirical evidence. The litera-
ture on CSR and Sustainability Reporting has
contributed to general knowledge and knowledge
on how to phrase the questions for the interview. In

Lizet Quaak et al.

this section, we will ﬁrst present the vision of the
breweries on CSR and Sustainability Reporting.
These visions reﬂect how breweries put CSR into
practice. We will then show how much inﬂuence
the driving factors have on CSR and sustainability
reporting. Not all driving factors are mentioned i.e.
the ones that are evident (see Table IV). Only the
ones that need to be emphasized are mentioned.

Interpretation of CSR and sustainability reporting

Previously in this article, seven aspects of CSR were
introduced from the theory. The interpretation of
the seven aspects of CSR are quite diverse (see
Table III). Compared to the theory, only the Triple
P and the continuance were aspects that breweries
mentioned and agreed to them as aspects concerning
CSR. During the interviews, it appeared breweries
preferred to discuss their CSR activities rather than
their Sustainability Reporting. Although almost
none of the breweries mentioned a majority of as-
pects found in the theory, except Gulpener, they
often spontaneously gave concrete examples of how
they put a speciﬁc aspect into practice.

The breweries had opposite opinions about three
topics: biological products, legislation and transpar-
ency. Some breweries consider cultivating biological
products as a CSR activity. Others thought that
cultivating according to present current legislation
on farming is a CSR activity. In this research, bio-
logical production can be considered as a part of
CSR, because it has a long-term orientation and
goes further than legislation. So a brewery can be
CSR, and not use biological raw materials. With
reference to legislation, some breweries considered
CSR to meet legal requirements. Since legislation
does not require Sustainability Reporting,
these
breweries do not publish a sustainability report. In
this research, again, CSR therefore goes further than
legislation in this research, making the last argument
groundless.

Social Reporting is a means to be transparent to
stakeholders and is not obvious for breweries (Ta-
ble III). One brewery was rather sceptic about sus-
tainability reporting and considered it
to be a
marketing tool or image-building. Since only four
breweries publish a report, it is interesting to note
which factors inﬂuenced them (see Table III).

Driving factors

Table IV shows the results of the interviews. Not
every factor
is discussed, because the narrative
nature of
the interviews ﬁts analyses of sponta-
neous reactions, thereby eliminating the need for
an exhaustive list of questions on factors. There is
a big difference in driving factors between CSR
and Sustainability Reporting. As seen in Table IV,
the breweries explained primarily the driving
factors inﬂuencing CSR. Sustainability Reporting
did not seem to be important according to most
breweries.

and large breweries

Distinction was made between small breweries
(>900
(<100 employees)
employees), because the number of employees
indicates the differences between breweries with
reference to their markets (national–international)
and their lines of business (large breweries are more
complex than those of the smaller breweries). For
the small breweries (3), the driving factors for CSR
were management,
employee, neighbourhood,
government, NGOs, costs, complexity and knowl-
edge. For the larger breweries (4), the factors men-
tioned for small breweries also inﬂuenced them,
although costs of CSR did not have impact on them.
The shareholders, on the other hand, did have an
effect on them. How these factors inﬂuence brew-
eries, is discussed below.

Management

According to breweries, management has a great
inﬂuence on CSR and Sustainability Reporting.
Since most breweries were historically managed by
families, who still have much inﬂuence, and in most
circumstances, own the majority of shares, social and
environmental aspects are traditionally of great value.
This expresses itself in long-term CSR activities.
Since beer is a natural product, breweries recognize
the importance of a healthy environment. Again,
managers of large breweries feel the need to stimu-
late Sustainability Reporting, because of their size.
Many are experiencing more and more pressure
from outside, stimulating Sustainability Reporting.
We emphasize that top management has a great
inﬂuence on the way CSR is deﬁned within the
organization. The implementation of the deﬁnition

of CSR can be considered as the core task of change
management (Kru¨ger, 1996). The way employees
express CSR in their daily activities, might be
considered as the way CSR is embedded in the
culture of their organization. Organizational imple-
mentation and cultural aspects of CSR are beyond
the scope of this paper.

Neighbourhood

People living in the same neighbourhood inﬂuence
breweries, since they are the ﬁrst ones confronted
with problems when a mishap occurs. Good
neighbours are important, since they can bother the
brewery when they are dissatisﬁed.

Employees

Government

Employees have a lot of inﬂuence. The social aspects
of CSR have, in part, an infectious inﬂuence on the
employees, who improve CSR by demanding
decent working conditions.

Although the large breweries acknowledge that
just a few employees are questioning Sustainability
Reporting, they feel that employees do have a po-
sitive inﬂuence. Sustainability reporting is a way to
bind employees to the companies and to share best
practices to stimulate employees.

Especially local government is important as this is the
authority holding inspections and granting permits.
The EU and national government exert inﬂuence on
breweries through agreements and legislation.

NGOs

Although contacts with NGOs are sometimes stiff,
they do inﬂuence CSR positively. NGOs stimulate

Lizet Quaak et al.

large breweries to publish a Sustainability Report,
because they demand openness. Breweries want to
publish their news before NGOs bring certain
information up. Therefore
it becomes more
important to publish not only on what is going well,
but also on situations or issues that need improve-
ment.

Consumers

(2005)

As a result of Social Reporting consumers should
ask for sustainable products (EZ, 2004)... Accord-
ing to the breweries, consumers do not ask for
these products. Vringer
investigated the
relation between values, problem perception and
motivation of consumers and the household energy
requirement. He concluded that values, problem
perception and motivation of consumers do not
result
in a signiﬁcant difference in the energy
requirement. The consumers’ acknowledgement of
the importance of social and environmental issues
like energy reduction and contesting poverty re-
tries to con-
sults in consumers’ behaviour that
tribute
and social
problems does not seem to be such an evident
assumption.

environmental

to tackling

Costs

Breweries indicate that CSR is expensive. The large
breweries feel they can cover costs because they can
spread them over all departments. Others indicate
that they do not know how much CSR costs, be-
cause they have been working in the same way for
years, while others declare it is hard to attribute the
costs solitary to CSR.

Small breweries do not want

to spend their
money on sustainability reports that nobody wants.
They also have to contract these reports out, be-
cause they are too small
to handle the work
themselves. According to them, it is better to spend
the money on something concrete like CSR. Large
breweries on the contrary indicate that the infor-
mation can be used for
internal and external
benchmarking, which makes it less expensive. Small
breweries already have a decent overview because
of their sizes.

Complexity

All breweries think that CSR is complex. To get all
information on time, from the right person and with
the right ﬁgures, is a heavy task. This restricts CSR.
Since small breweries have
limited resources,
employees combine tasks. It is too difﬁcult for them
to organize decent reporting into their daily routine.
For larger breweries, it is complex to publish a
sustainability report, obtaining the same ﬁgures like
water and energy use from plants all over the world.
Furthermore, not everybody is willing to give the
information in the right way, because it is time-
consuming.

Knowledge

Closely related to complexity, is knowledge. CSR is
a complex concept, which makes it hard to grasp
which bit of knowledge is necessary and how it can
be obtained. There are also many dilemmas that
organizations are confronted with, thereby restrict-
ing CSR. It is difﬁcult to publish a sustainability
report, because knowledge about guidelines, stan-
dards etc. is needed. Employees of small breweries
combine tasks and therefore are not specialized in
Sustainability Reporting. For large breweries, it is a
complex task to get the right information, because
one has to stick to the same standards over the
world.

Conclusions

There is a scale effect of driving factors inﬂuencing
CSR and Sustainability Reporting. Local
stake-
holders have more inﬂuence on smaller breweries
than national or international
factors. Only the
international breweries ﬁnd international
largest
stakeholders
important, but depending on the
organizational and national culture, they ﬁnd some
stakeholders more important than others. For in-
stance, when the head ofﬁce is in Belgium, CSR
is less important than it is in the Netherlands; this
has an effect on the companies’ attitude towards
CSR.

CSR is an important issue for breweries. There
are a lot of factors stimulating breweries to adopt

step for

CSR. Most of them have a clear vision of this
concept. Large breweries
focus on (worldwide)
efﬁciency improvements, and have stakeholders all
over the world watching them, who can make or
break the carefully built image of an organization
(NRC, 25 April 2005). Public transparency is a
natural next
them in monitoring and
developing their CSR activities. But there are dif-
ferences. Due to the complexity of Sustainability
Reporting and required knowledge,
achieving
transparency is a long haul. CSR and Sustainability
Reporting is a learning process, which takes time.
This has an effect on the quality of sustainability
reports, which is low and stabilizing (EZ, 2004;
Feenstra, 2004), although quality is showing slow
improvement. In fact, according to Feenstra (2004),
the same situation is evolving as the social reports in
the 70s of the last century: although it is popular
now, it bleeds to death because of the absence of
clear norms (Feenstra, 2004). This is also visible in
the driving factors inﬂuencing CSR. While brew-
eries try to achieve Corporate Social Responsibility,
Sustainability Reporting is not a big issue for small
breweries. Most small breweries (<100 employees)
think it is too expensive, too complex and time-
consuming. They are of the opinion that the money
otherwise spent on reporting should,
instead, be
spent on the main issue: CSR.

The larger breweries pay more attention to Sus-
tainability Reporting. Apart
from management,
stakeholders too ask for sustainability reports. Al-
though some breweries want to publish the report,
they also point out that Sustainability Reporting is
complex and difﬁcult. It is very difﬁcult to obtain all
the ﬁgures they need for their sustainability reports
from their divisions all over the world. It takes time,
which makes it expensive. On the other hand, when
they ﬁnally have the information, they can use it for
other goals, like internal benchmarking. Neverthe-
less, the quality of the reports differs and is stabilizing
at low levels. Why is the transparency of CSR not
self-evident?

As mentioned above, there are few driving factors
inﬂuencing Sustainability Reporting. A sustainability
report represents an extra general report, and dem-
onstrates a wide range of other reporting methods,
exclusively published from an inhabitant’s perspec-
tive. But although inhabitants
should stimulate
CSR by purchasing products, which are very

environmentally and socially friendly (on the basis of
information from the sustainability reports), there is
no indication that they do so (Vringer, 2005). So
why would organizations publish a sustainability
report? They do not see the need for Sustainability
Reporting, the only factor pushing them to publish
the report
the government. This push forces
companies to publish a sustainability report because
it becomes a necessity, which can harm the image of
the company if not done.

is

Publishing the report does not mean that brew-
eries do not want to be transparent: they only want
to be transparent in another way. The institutions
that have to take cognizance of the activities of the
breweries, like the tax department, media, govern-
ment, shareholders, already have their entry point in
the organizations, through other means than a Sus-
tainability Report. Furthermore, interested inhabit-
ants can receive information through guided tours,
lectures, etc., which is more informative than the
sustainability
Sustainability
Reporting does not improve CSR, and therefore,
Sustainability Reporting is not relevant for demon-
strating transparency of CSR. Multinationals publish
a Sustainability Report because large institutions
producing sustainability indexes and indicators use
the reports investigating CSR activities of organi-
zations, inﬂuenced by governmental proclamations
of the importance of CSR (Sustainability report –
Philips, 2004; Sustainability Report – Heineken,
2003). But these institutions do not automatically
verbalize the needs of society.

Theoretical discussion

Further research is needed for quantitative mea-
surement of the inﬂuence of driving factors. The
qualitative analysis of this study is a subjective one,
although two interviewers carried out the analysis, it
cannot measure the ‘‘amount of
the
driving factors had. Further research to measure
degrees of
factors could have is
necessary, especially the willingness of consumers to
buy sustainable products. Furthermore, if the effects
of the implementation of CSR should be measured,
quantitative research is needed. Kru¨ ger

already mentioned that top management has the task
to implement changes into the organizations’ daily
activities. Subsequently, quantitative research could
be applied to measure the contribution of CSR-
policy on the organizational goals and objectives.

This research is based on breweries only. Due to
the qualitative research method, it is not possible to
project all results on other sectors. In exploring the
factors that stimulate Sustainability Reporting by
Dutch companies, it will be necessary to interview
companies in every sector for a better comprehen-
sion of what drives them to implement CSR. As a
follow up to the interviews it might be possible to set
up an inquiry for the entire sector.

Since reporting is expensive for small companies,
it would be a relief for them to have shorter and
simpler guidelines. The Global Reporting Initiative5
has drawn up guidelines but these require heavy
reading, so a ‘‘score card’’ could be a better option.

Other studies

Graaﬂand et al. (2003a) indicated that the size of
companies has a positive inﬂuence on the use of
instruments like behavioural codes, ISO certiﬁca-
tion, social reporting etc. These results agree with
ours, however, the same study indicates that there
are no differences between family-run and non-
family run businesses on the use of the mentioned
instruments. Although Hemingway and Maclagan
(2004) indicate that values of individuals with power
do make a difference for CSR, this factor will need
further investigation.

Empirical discussion

the sustainability reports differ,

Sustainability reporting is not what it was meant to
be. It is not the best way to transparency. The
quality of
the
information varies and the target group is not
enthusiastic. Only the government
is stimulating
Sustainability Reporting. Will
Sustainability
Reporting end the same way as public environ-
mental reporting, where government has repealed
compulsory public environmental reporting, since
no one is interested (Aalbers, 2004)? Sustainability
reporting will, most likely, disappear if there is no

clear legislation on what is expected from companies
– for sustainability and for CSR. The social volun-
tariness that the government prefers is also one-si-
ded. Only companies are forced to participate in
CSR and show transparency, not inhabitants. Can
CSR succeed under these circumstances, especially
when there is not a clear standard for CSR com-
panies to work towards? Is the willingness of com-
panies great enough to push the frontiers back and
put all out the stops to assure that future generations
retain possibilities to meet their own needs accord-
ing to the deﬁnition of Brundtland (WCED, 1987)?
This could be dependent on the future develop-
ments of society: i.e. what will companies be ex-
pected to do?

The Netherlands Environmental Assessment
Agency (MNP-RIVM) has expressed the future of
sustainability in the form of
four world visions,
including different visions for which goals should
strive. Perceptions of the availability of means and
opinions about
steering and distributing options
were taken into account (RIVM, 2004). Further
studies on the possible effects of these world visions
on the future development of CSR could be inter-
esting for judging how the future of CSR might
develop.
