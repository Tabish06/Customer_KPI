  ABSTRACT 
 Prior research suggests that corporate reputation 
is a determinant of initial investment decisions, 
possibly  leading  to  detrimental  stock  choices. 
Its  effect  on  established  investor  relationships, 
namely  investor  satisfaction  and  loyalty,  are 
novel  research  areas.  The  present  paper  dis-
cusses findings of a study among German in-
vestors  of  a  publicly  traded  company  that  put 
into perspective the aforementioned detrimental 
choice-effect, the impact of reputation on indi-
vidual  investor  behavior  and  reveals  a  diver-
sity of loyalty effects of corporate reputation.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Today, one of the forces accelerating corpo-
rate  reputation ’ s  value  to  ﬁ rms  is  the  vast 
need  for  investment  capital.  If  investors 
believe reputation conveys important infor-
mation  about  the  proﬁ t  and  long-term 
potential  of  a  company  (eg   Fombrun  and 
Shanley, 1990 ;  Brown and Perry, 1994 ), the 
 ‘ reputation of a ﬁ rm increasingly will inﬂ u-
ence  its  appeal  as  an  investment  choice ’  
( Chajet, 1997: 20 ). While this area of research 
has  been  of  interest  to  investor  relations 
managers for decades, the effects of the com-
pany ’ s  reputation  on  the  attitudes  and  be-
havior of non-institutional shareholders has

hardly been dealt with empirically. Although 
some  evidence  might  have  been  accumu-
lated  by  accounting  ﬁ rms,  it  tends  to  deal 
with institutional investors and remain pro-
prietary, establishing a need to further inves-

investors ’   responses 

individual 

 According to studies in behavioral ﬁ nance, 
individual  investors ’   predilection  to  judge 
companies  as  better  investment  opportuni-
ties because they are perceived as highly re-
puted might be a fallacy. In current studies, 
corporate  reputation  is  investigated  as  a 
determinant  in  the  formation  of  risk  and 
return expectations. Investors tend to assume 
that  good  investment  opportunities  come 
from  ‘ good ’  companies, that is from compa-
nies with a high reputational rating ( Shefrin 
and  Statman,  1995 ;   Shefrin,  2001 ).  Relying 
on  survey  data  published  by   Fortune   maga-
zine on the reputation of major US compa-
nies,  Shefrin  ﬁ nds that  ‘ Investors who judge 
that good stocks are stocks of good compa-
nies will associate  good  stocks with both  safe  
stocks and high future earnings ’  (2001: 179). 
This  deﬁ es  empirical  evidence  that  proves 
the opposite to be true. Investors err if they 
expect  safe  stocks  and  high  future  earnings 
(only) 
from   ‘ good ’ ,  or  highly  reputed 
companies ( Shefrin, 2001 ). There might be, 
however, more to reputation ’ s role in deter-
mining  investor  behavior  than  this  possibly 
misleading choice-effect. 

 Generally,  investor  behavior  can  be  ana-
lyzed  in  terms  of  initial  share  purchases

study and suggestions for future research are 
presented in the ﬁ nal section.   

 DEFINITIONS AND THEORETICAL 
BACKGROUND  

 Deﬁ ning Corporate Reputation 
 A  growing  body  of  literature  has  led  to  an 
abundance of alternative deﬁ nitions of cor-
porate reputation.  Gotsi and Wilson , for in-
stance,  highlight  numerous  viewpoints  and 
conclude that, in general, corporate reputa-
tion  should  be  viewed  as   ‘ a  stakeholder ’ s 
overall  evaluation  of  a  company  over  time ’  
(2001:  29).  Reputation  is  a  socially  shared 
impression,  a  consensus  about  how  a  ﬁ rm 
will behave in any given situation ( Bromley, 
2002 ;   Sandberg,  2002 ).  It  is  based  on  a  set 
of collectively held beliefs about a company ’ s 
ability and willingness to satisfy the interests 
of  various  stakeholders  ( Fombrun,  1996 ). 
Recent  work  has  emphasized  the  plurality 
of perceptions and representations concern-
ing  a  company,  but  it  has  mainly  centered 
on the customers ’ , employees ’ , and the gen-
eral  public ’ s  perspectives.  While  analysts ’  
view  on  reputation  has  sporadically  been 
taken  into  account  ( Fombrun   et  al .,  2000 ; 
 Mazzola   et  al .,  2004 ),  reputational  percep-
tions by individual investors are a novel ﬁ eld 
of research.   

 Research Streams on the Effects of 
Corporate Reputation in Financial 
Markets 
 Extant  research  suggests  that   –   from  the 
ﬁ rm ’ s  point  of  view   –   a  good  reputation 
allows  it  to  charge  premium  prices,  attract 
better  applicants  for  its  workforce,  attract 
investors, and lower its cost of capital, mak-
ing it one of the ﬁ rm ’ s most important in-
tangible  assets  (eg   Hammond  and  Slocum, 
1996 ;  Fombrun, 1996 ;  Little and Little, 2000 ). 
 Larsen  (2002)   goes  so  far  as  to  claim 

(eg  Shefrin, 2001 ), in terms of switching be-
havior in the context of portfolio optimiza-
tion (eg  Spurgin and Tamarkin, 2005 ), or in 
the context of  ‘ sticking to stocks ’  (eg dispo-
sition  effects,   Shefrin  and  Statman,  1984 ). 
From the perspective of the individual pub-
licly traded ﬁ rm, it may be beneﬁ cial when 
individual  investors  keep  their  shares  on  a 
long-term basis. Leaving detailed analyses to 
future  research  contributions,  we  propose 
that investor loyalty leads to stable relation-
ships that reduce the risk of a (hostile) take-
over; to less volatility in share prices; to the 
possibility  of 
long-term 
strategies instead of quarter-based activities; 
to a reduction of costs induced by investor 
relations.  Among  others,  satisfaction  with 
investment  outcomes  (ie  the  fulﬁ llment  of 
investor expectations) and corporate reputa-
tion are interpreted as determinants of inves-
tor loyalty.

 Role of Corporate Reputation 

that  companies  manage  their  reputations 
 mainly   for  ﬁ nancial  reasons.  Concerning 
stakeholders ’   point  of  view,  a  major  stream 
of research focuses on reputation ’ s potential 
as  a  signal  that  serves  to  reduce  customers ’  
uncertainty  considering  product  quality 
(eg   Shapiro,  1982 ),  uncertainty  of  (future) 
employees with regard to employer charac-
teristics  (eg   Cable  and  Graham,  2000 ), 
uncertainty of players on the capital market 
concerning 
stock  performance 
(eg  Baker and Haslem, 1973 ), etc. 

future 

 With regard to corporate reputation ’ s role 
among  actors  on  ﬁ nancial  markets,  three 
streams of research are noteworthy. First, the 
dominant literature stream in this ﬁ eld deals 
with the link between ﬁ nancial performance 
of  the  ﬁ rm  and  its  reputation  (see  among 
many,     Sobol  and  Farrelly,  1988 ;   Hammond 
and  Slocum,  1996 ).  To  a  large  part,  these 
studies  conclude  that  ﬁ rms  with  relatively 
good  reputations  are  better  able  to  sustain 
superior proﬁ t outcomes over time (eg  Rob-
erts  and  Dowling,  2002 ),  although  these 
ﬁ ndings  are  far  from  being  undisputed 
(eg  Sabate and Puente, 2003 ). A subgroup of 
these studies deal with the impact of reputa-
tion  on 
in  ﬁ nancial  markets. 
 Fombrun  for example observes that  ‘ compa-
nies with higher stocks of reputational cap-
ital tend to be assigned better ratings ’  (1996: 
119) and  Deephouse  introduces the concept 
of  ‘ ﬁ nancial reputation ’  which he deﬁ nes as 
 ‘ the general evaluation of a company ’ s ﬁ nan-
cial  prospects  made  by  the  ﬁ nancial  rating 
industry ’  (1997: 69). 

ratings 

 A second stream relevant to ﬁ eld of inter-
est is the vast literature on the role of repu-
tation  in  individual  investment  decision 
making. For instance,  MacGregor  et al . (2000)  
claim that in IPO ’ s, reputation and an affec-
tive evaluation provide the basis for investor 
buying decisions.  Brown  mentions that  ‘ poor 
reputation  signals  to  investors  that  disaster 
lurks,  and  that  when  it  strikes,  those  com-
panies  will  not  have  the  necessary  public 
support  they  need  to  weather  the  storm ’  

(1998:  279).   Shefrin  and  Statman  (1995)   as 
well as  Srivastava  et al . (1997)  ﬁ nd evidence 
that current or potential investors perceive a 
company with a good reputation to be less 
risky than companies with equivalent ﬁ nan-
cial performance, but a less well-established 
reputation.  In  spite  of  equivalent  risk  and 
return prospects, highly reputed ﬁ rms proﬁ t 
from investors who are willing to pay more 
for  their  shares  than  for  shares  of  less  re-
puted ﬁ rms ( Larsen, 2002 ), and who expect 
a  lower  return  on  investment  ( Srivastava   et 
al ., 1997 ). 

  Bondt  (1998)   and   Gardberg  (2001)   cau-
tion  that  corporate  reputation  and  share 
price do not necessarily correlate. This ﬁ nd-
ing  has  been  substantiated  by   Shefrin  and 
Statman (1995)  who claim that  ‘ good ’  com-
panies do not necessarily issue  ‘ good ’  stocks 
(ie  stocks  with  share  price  increases  above 
average).  Corporate  reputation  serves  not 
only  as  a  performance  signal,  though,  but 
can become a choice criterion itself as indi-
vidual  investors  are  not  exclusively  inter-
ested in high dividends or share appreciation 
( Hunt, 1952 ). Although return is the prime 
factor in investment decisions ( Bondt, 1998 ; 
 Chajet,  1997 ),  corporate  reputation  climbs 
up the scale of importance.  ‘ The more stock-
holders  there  are,  the  more  people  will  be 
sensitive to the reputations of the companies 
in  which  they  are  investing ’   ( Chajet,  1997: 
22 ),  especially  in  post-Enron  times  ( Dowl-
ing,  2004 ).  As   Hanson  and  Stuart   remark, 
 ‘ shareholders may be interested in proﬁ t but 
they will also share the shame and declining 
proﬁ ts  associated  with  a  deteriorating  cor-
porate reputation which is now increasingly 
the  subject  of  media  and  public  scrutiny ’  
(2001: 141). Social and psychological aspects 
determine  individual  investment  behavior 
to  a  considerable  extent  ( Shefrin,  2001 ; 
 Goldberg  and  Nitzsch,  2001 ),  especially 
because  of  the  ever-increasing  amount  of 
information  available  to 
investors.   ‘ The 
complexity  of  the  task  may  drive  the 
respondent  to  weigh  affective  cues  more

information  on  customer  attitudes  and 
behaviors  in  this  speciﬁ c  product / service 
environment may provide insights into repu-
tation ’ s role in determining individual inves-
tors ’   reactions  to  reputation.  While  these 
ﬁ ndings will be pointed out in more detail 
below, it can be summarized that albeit there 
is numerous evidence on the role corporate 
reputation  plays  in  different  contexts  of 
ﬁ nancial  markets,  individual  investors ’   per-
ceptions of corporate reputation have hardly 
been  focused.  In  such  a  setting,   corporate 
reputation signiﬁ es an investor ’ s perception of the 
estimation  in  which   ‘  his / her  ’    ﬁ rm  is  held  by  its 
stakeholders in general  which results from the 
company ’ s ability and willingness to perform 
according  to  its  promises  to  these  different 
stakeholder groups.   

 The Loyalty of Individual Investors 
 Investor  behavior  has  been  the  subject  of 
diverse  studies  in  the  ﬁ eld  of  behavioral 
ﬁ nance  (eg   Shleifer,  2000 ;   Shefrin,  2002 ; 
 Shiller, 2003 ) that approach the subject with 
psychological or sociological theories. While 
initial investment decisions are analyzed, the 
long-term behavior of investors as reﬂ ected 
in  their  loyalty  is  often  disregarded. This  is 
striking insofar as there is a widespread man-
agerial  and  academic  interest  in  the  loyalty 
of other stakeholder groups, such as custom-
ers and employees. 

settings, 

in  customer 

 Owing to the novelty of the research area, 
we  model  investor  loyalty  and  its  link  to 
reputation  and  satisfaction  equivalently  to 
ﬁ ndings 
thereby 
interpreting  investors  as  customers  for  the 
ﬁ rm ’ s  ‘ most  important  product,  namely,  the 
company  itself  ’   ( Ferris,  1989:  173 ).  Conse-
quently,  deﬁ nitions  of  the  constructs  might 
be  based  on  prior  work  in  marketing 
research. According to Oliver, the term  ‘ cus-
tomer  loyalty ’   signiﬁ es  ‘ a  deeply  held  com-
mitment to rebuy or repatronize a preferred 
product or service consistently in the future ’  
(1997:  392).   Dick  and  Basu   understand  it 
to be the  ‘ favorable correspondence between 
relative attitude and repeat patronage ’  (1994: 
102).  Presumably,  affective  predispositions 
and  repetitive  behavior  also  form  different 
kinds  of  investor  loyalty. As  ﬁ nancial  deci-
sions  are  taken  in  situations  of  high  com-
plexity  and  high  uncertainty  that  preclude 
reliance  on  predeﬁ ned  rules,  the  individual 
is  constrained  to  rely  on  intuition  and 
emotion (   Kahneman and Riepe, 1998 ). In a 
ﬁ nancial  services  setting,   Bloemer  and  de 
Ruyter  (1998)   deﬁ ne  customers ’   loyalty  as 
a  behavioral  response  that  is  a  function  of 
psychological processes resulting in commit-
ment,  which  again  may  be  understood  as 
the  pledging  or  binding  of  the  individual 
customer to his / her bank of choice.  Affec-
tive  evaluation  must  be  considered  one  of 
the  most  fundamental  psychological  proc-
esses in ﬁ nancial decision making ( MacGre-
gor   et  al .,  2000 ).  Furthermore,  loyalty  can 
also  be  understood  as  a  behavior  because 
individuals usually act according to an affec-
tive  predisposition.  Consequently,  affective 
loyalty  should  be  viewed  as  an  antecedent 
to behavioral loyalty. In an investment con-
text,  this  behavioral  element  does  not 
become  manifest  in  repatronage  but  in  the 
will  and  the  actions  taken  to  continue  and 
intensify the existing relationship to a ﬁ rm. 
For instance, behavioral loyalty might be re-
ﬂ ected  in  the  holding  period  of  shares,  the 
purchase  of  additional  shares  of  the  same

 Role of Corporate Reputation 

ﬁ rm,  advising  other  investors  to  buy  the 
shares. 

 Many  studies  have  been  published  on 
the relationship of satisfaction and loyalty in 
customer  settings.  While  both  constructs 
seem to be linked inextricably, their relation-
ship is asymmetric and satisfaction is not the 
only, and sometimes also an unreliable, pre-
cursor to loyalty ( Oliver, 1999 ). This is also 
supported  by  a  number  of  studies  in  retail 
banking  that  ﬁ nd  satisfaction  to  be  a  main 
determinant of customer loyalty ( Hallowell, 
1996 ; 
 Levesque  and  McDougall,  1996 ; 
 Bloemer  and  de  Ruyter,  1998 ). As  existing 
and empirically tested theories in customer 
behavior cannot be transferred to an investor 
context  without  further  investigation,  the 
hypothesized  link  between  investor  satis-
faction and loyalty deserves empirical study. 
Satisfaction  is  deﬁ ned  as  the  result  of  a 
favorable  correspondence  between  a  cus-
tomer ’ s  expectations  and  his / her  experi-
ences with a ﬁ rm ( Churchill and Surprenant, 
1982 ),  and  the  same  expectancy-disconﬁ r-
mation  paradigm  might  be  applied  to 
investors. 

is  convinced 

 In customer settings, investigations of rep-
utation as a determinant of loyalty have led 
to inconsistent results and remained a matter 
of  debate  ( Bloemer  and  de  Ruyter,  1998 ).

 Nguyen  and  Leblanc  (2001)   and  Anderson 
and  Sullivan  (1993)   take  reputation  as  an 
important determinant of loyalty.  Yoon  et al . 
(1993)  and  Abdullah  et al . (2000)  ﬁ nd a pos-
itive relationship between corporate reputa-
tion and the intention to buy a ﬁ rm ’ s prod-
ucts,  and   Martensen   et  al .  (2000)   report 
that  corporate  image  is  a  main  driver  of 
customer  satisfaction  and  loyalty  in  retail 
banking.   Andreassen  and  Lindestad  (1998)  
do  not  support  the  hypothesized  direct  im-
pact of corporate image (interpreted synony-
mously to reputation) on loyalty, and also the 
study  results  discussed  by   Bloemer  and  de 
Ruyter  (1998)   initially  do  not  support  the 

hypothesized direct impact of corporate im-
age on bank customers ’  satisfaction and loy-
alty but show that this effect is mediated by 
perceived quality. The authors also point out 
that   –   as  an  input  for  customer  evaluations 
 –   image  perceptions  should  precede  satis-
faction  and  loyalty.  All  studies  at  hand 
focus  customer  settings  whereas  no  primary 
studies  have  been  undertaken  to  determine 
the impact of reputation on investor satisfac-
tion and loyalty. 

 The  impact  of  reputation  on  investor 
satisfaction  and  loyalty  may  be  explained 
by   Festinger’s  (1957)   theory  of  cognitive 
dissonance  and  self-perception  theories  (eg 
 Bem, 1967 ). If an investor purchased shares 
of a highly esteemed ﬁ rm, the favorable pub-
lic  perception  of  the  ﬁ rm  might  reinforce 
his  stock  choice,  his  self-perceived  compe-
tence in investment decisions, his self-esteem, 
leading  to  satisfaction  and  possibly  longer 
holding periods of the stock. If another in-
vestor bought stock from a ﬁ rm with a bad 
reputation, the negative public perception of 
the stock might lead to cognitive dissonance 
and  a  generally  more  negative  attitude 
towards  the  stock. This  might  cause  her  to 
reconsider  her  decision,  have  a  negative 
impact on perceived satisfaction, and the in-
vestor  might  be  more  inclined  to  sell  the 
stock  in  order  to  reduce  any  psychological 
pain 
induced  by  cognitive  dissonance. 
Furthermore,  the  representativeness  effect 
studied  in  behavioral  ﬁ nance  (eg   Shefrin, 
2001 ;   Goldberg  and  Nitzsch,  2001 )  might 
lead  to  premature  selling  of  stock  from

mbrun  et al ., 2000 ), plus information on the 
governance structure of the ﬁ rm and its in-
vestor relations. Whether this is also true for 
individual  investors  is  uncertain.  Individual 
investors often do not possess the necessary 
expertise  to  understand  governance  issues, 
and they rarely contact investor relations de-
partments ( Mazzola  et al ., 2004 ). 

 Owing to the lack of empirical concepts 
for  reputation  as  perceived  by  individual 
investors,  investor  satisfaction,  and  loyalty, 
novel measures are developed for our study. 
For developing the measurement models, the 
methodology  proposed  by   Diamantopoulos 
and  Winklhofer  (2001)   was  followed.  The 
ﬁ rst  step  in  scale  development  is  content 
speciﬁ cation,  that  is  the  deﬁ nition  of  the 
constructs.  From  its  diverse  stakeholders ’  
views,  corporate  reputation  captures  a 
combination of social and economic contri-
butions that a company makes. As a conse-
quence, rankings of companies that are based 
on  a  cluster  of  different  corporate  associa-
tions representing different stakeholders ’  ex-
pectations  regarding  the  activities  of  a  ﬁ rm 
(eg  product  quality,  use  of  employee  talent, 
corporate social responsibility) have become 
the  dominant  approach  to  measure  corpo-
rate  reputation  ( Wartick,  2002 ;   Berens  and 
Riel,  2004 ).  Existing  scales  on  reputation 
(such as Fortune ’ s Most Admired Company 
Index  and 
the  Reputation  Quotient), 
satisfaction,  and  loyalty,  two  focus  group 
interviews,  and  10  in-depths  interviews 
with  individual  investors  provided  input

 SCALE DEVELOPMENT 
 Whether all types of stakeholders base their 
perceptions of reputation on the same fun-
damental  set  of  dimensions  or  on  speciﬁ c 
expectations is controversial ( Bromley, 2002 ; 
 Fombrun  et al ., 2000 ). In a preliminary study 
on corporate reputation as perceived by in-
stitutional  investors,   Mazzola   et  al .  (2004)  
found  that  this  stakeholder  group  evaluates 
reputation  according  to  the  dimensions 
relevant to other stakeholders (as for instance

 Role of Corporate Reputation 

for  construct  conceptualization.  Following 
this  detailed  procedure  was  supposed  to 
grant content validity of the constructs  –  the 
kind of validity  Rossiter (2002)  claims to be 
most  essential  when  deﬁ ning  measurement 
models.  Furthermore,  corporate  reputation 
could be deﬁ ned taking into account input 
by  the  potential  respondents  ( Berens  and 
Riel, 2004 ). 

 Potential indicators for the measures were 
identiﬁ ed  by  looking  for  items  commonly 
used  in  prior  construct  models,  and  by 
integrating  the  results  of  the  interviews. 
Interestingly,  individual  investors  did  not 
speciﬁ cally  emphasize  ﬁ nancial  aspects  as  a 
dominant  dimension  of 
the  reputation 
construct. The list of possible indicators was 
then  further  reﬁ ned  including  an  item-sort 
task that showed how well the items tapped 
into their constructs ( Anderson and Gerbing, 
1991 ). Finally, questionnaires were adminis-
tered to 20 investors in a  ‘ think aloud ’  answer 
mode. The 10 remaining reputation indica-
tors, four indicators for investors ’  satisfaction, 
and  four  indicators  for  each  of  the  loyalty 
constructs  were  then  included  in  the  ﬁ nal 
survey.  In  accordance  with   Rossiter  (2002) , 
bipolar  7-  or  5-point  scales  were  used  (for 
details on wording and scales, see  Table 1 ). 
 In  structural  equation  modeling,  every 
construct or latent variable is assigned a set 
of indicators that may be reﬂ ective or form-
ative leading to different epistemic structures 
of  the  constructs  (eg   Bollen  and  Lennox, 
1991 ;   Jarvis   et  al .,  2003 ;   MacKenzie   et  al ., 
2005 ; Helm, 2005  ). In the reﬂ ective case, the 
unobserved latent variable effects the indica-
tors, meaning that all indicators  ‘ measure the 
same  thing  and  should  covary  at  a  high 
level  if  they  are  good  measures  of  the 
underlying  variable ’   ( Bagozzi,  1994:  331 ).  If  the 
latent variable is thought to be a construct of 
all of its indicators  –  like an index or ranking 
 –  it needs to be measured formatively.  ‘ Form-
ative  indicators  give  rise  to  the  unobserved 
theoretical construct. In this case the empiri-
cal  indicators  produce  or  contribute  to  the 

construct ’   ( Fornell,  1982:  8 ).  We  therefore 
decided to model corporate reputation and 
investor  satisfaction  with  formative  indica-
tors,  affective  and  behavioral  loyalty  were 
modeled as reﬂ ective constructs. 

 Conceptualizing reputation as a formative 
construct means that it is thought to be an 
aggregation of all its indicators such as prod-
uct quality, quality of management, etc. This 
implies  that  because  of  the  quality  of  its 
products, a ﬁ rm has a good reputation; be-
cause  of  the  quality  of  its  management,  it 
has a good reputation, etc. The same applies 
to the measure of satisfaction that is also seen 
as a summation of a ﬁ rm ’ s performances such 
as  the  amount  of  dividends  paid  to  share-
holders, the information policy of the ﬁ rm, 
etc.  In  accordance  with  the  literature  ( An-
dreassen,  1994 ;   Oliver,  1997 ),  both  types  of 
loyalty  were  conceptualized  as  reﬂ ective 
constructs.  Increasing  loyalty  of  an  investor 
will  usually  result  in  a  variety  of  different 
attitudinal and behavioral consequences. The 
more  loyal,  the  more  often  the  investor 
might  refer  the  shares  to  others,  buy  more 
shares  of  the  same  company,  and  the  more 
s / he will be willing to keep shares on a long-
term  basis.  S / He  will  show  the  entirety  of 
the possible characteristics of loyal investors 
including  a  positive  personal  disposition 
towards the ﬁ rm.   

 RESEARCH DESIGN AND SAMPLE 
STRUCTURE 
 Knowledge  on  investor  satisfaction,  loyalty, 
and  reputation  as  perceived  by  individual 
investors is scarce, and the interplay of these 
constructs is a novel research area. Therefore, 
the aim of the empirical study was to explain 
variance  resulting  from  different  levels  of 
perceived reputation, satisfaction, and loyalty; 
it was not to explain variances resulting from 
differences  of  the  constructs  in  different 
industries or ﬁ rms. Therefore, the study was 
restricted to one company and its indivi dual 
investors. This was also necessary because we 
had  to  cooperate  closely  with  a  company

that possesses data of its individual investors. 
Most German corporations use bearer shares, 
not  registered  shares.  Typically,  individual 
investors remain unknown to the company 
unless it uses the annual general shareholder 
meeting  and  investor  relations  efforts  to 
build up a database of its shareholders. This 
is still rather rare as  ‘ shareholder relationship 
management ’  
is  as  yet  not  commonly 
implemented in most German ﬁ rms. A well-
known 
consumer  goods 
producer (fast-moving consumer goods such 
as  detergent,  and  cosmetics)  was  willing  to 
cooperate  and  provided  the  addresses  of 
1,120 individual investors. 

international 

individual 

 A standardized questionnaire was sent to 
investors. 
all  of  these  1,120 
The response rate amounted to 59 per cent 
(665  responses)  which  is  very  satisfying  for 
a  written  survey  ( Dillman,  2000 ). As  some 
questionnaires  missed  relevant  data,  the 
effective  sample  size  was  reduced  to  657 
usable questionnaires. 

 As the model to be tested contains form-
ative  and  reﬂ ective  constructs,  partial  least 
squares (PLS) was used for data analysis; the 
software package used was PLS-Graph. PLS 
allows for incorporating formative as well as 
reﬂ ective measurement models and is distri-
bution-free ( J ö reskog and Wold, 1982 ;  Fornell 
and Bookstein, 1982 ).   

 RESULTS 
 In a ﬁ rst step, we analyzed the formative and 
reﬂ ective  measurement  models. The  results 
are  shown  in  Table  1 . An  evaluation  of  the 
formative  measurement  models  is  based  on 
the  weights  and   t -values  of  the  indicators. 
 ‘ The weights provide information as to what 
the makeup and relative importance are for 
each indicator in the creation / formation of 
the component ’  ( Chin, 1998: 307 ). In  Table 
1 , weights that are not signiﬁ cant at  p     =    0.05 
are marked in gray (columns 3 and 4). One 
indicator  of  the  satisfaction  construct  and 
three  of  the  reputation  indicators  have 
weights  below  0.1  and  one  has  a  negative

sign  making  it  necessary  to  consider  scale 
puriﬁ cation.  It  has 
that 
the  literature  is  inconsistent  concerning 
the  elimination  of 
indicators 
( Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer, 2001 ). We 
follow  J ö reskog and Wold (1982) ,  Seltin and 
Keeves (1994) , and  MacKenzie  et al . (2005)  
who  suggest  to  remove  weak  indicators  in 
order  to  build  parsimonious  models.  This 
procedure reduces the satisfaction construct 
to three items and the reputation construct 
to seven items (see  Table 1 ). 

 Concerning  formative  indicators,  multi-
collinearity  has  to  be  investigated  as  the 
formative  measurement  model  is  based 
on  a  multiple  regression  ( Diamantopoulos 
and Winklhofer,  2001 ).  In  the  dataset,  the 
highest value for the variance inﬂ ation factor 
(VIF)  was  1.86  for  reputation  which  is  far 
below the common cut-off threshold of 10 
( Kleinbaum   et al .,  1998 ). The VIF  could  be 
computed by correlating the indicators to a 
single-item  overall  measure  of  reputation 
(the question was:  ‘ Does company x have a 
good or bad reputation in the public? ’ , meas-
ured  on  a  7-point  scale  from  ‘ a  very  good 
reputation ’   to  ‘ a  very  bad  reputation ’ ). The 
highest indicator correlations were 0.580 for 
the  reputation  construct  and  0.638  for  sat-
isfaction,  so  multi-collinearity  should  not 
pose a serious problem. 

 An  evaluation  of  the  reﬂ ective  measures 
of loyalty is based on the loadings,  t -values, 
and item reliability of each indicator. As all 
of the indicators feature a loading above or 
approaching  the  common  threshold  of  0.7, 
scale  puriﬁ cation  is  not  deemed  necessary 
( Baumgartner  and  Homburg,  1996 ).  The 
whole set of loyalty items was subjected to 
an exploratory factor analysis with varimax 
rotation  ( Hair   et  al .,  1998 ),  resulting  in  a 
KMO-value of 0.85. As could be expected, 
 two dimensions  were identiﬁ ed for loyalty: one 
contained  all  affective  items,  the  other  in-
cluded all behavioral indicators. As hypoth-
esized, two separate latent variables have to 
be  integrated  in  the  structural  model. The

 Helm 

average variance extracted amounts to 55.5 
per cent for behavioral loyalty and 67.5 per 
cent for affective loyalty (see  Table 1 ). 

 In the next step of data analysis, the struc-
tural  model  needs  to  be  investigated  (see 
 Figure  2 ).  All  except  one  of  the  path  co-
efﬁ cients  are  signiﬁ cant  at   p     =    0.01.  The 
strongest effect shows path  a  from reputation 
to investor satisfaction. The direct path  c  from 
satisfaction  to  behavioral  loyalty  is  stronger 
than  the  equivalent  path   b   to  affective 
loyalty. The  effect  of  affective  loyalty  on  its 
behavioral counterpart (path  f  ) is only slight-
ly  stronger  than   b .  The  direct  effect  of 
reputation on affective loyalty is quite con-
siderable  (path   d ),  whereas  the  direct  effect 
on  behavioral  loyalty  (path   e )  is  weak  and 
non-signiﬁ cant. In order to build a parsimo-
nious  model  ( Hair   et  al .,  1998 ),  this  path   e  
is eliminated from the inner model. 

 This leads to a reﬁ ned model that is shown 
in   Figure  3   (weights  and  loadings  of  the 
reﬁ ned model are shown in  Table 1 , columns 
5  and  6). The  elimination  of  the  non-sig-
niﬁ cant  path   e   results  in  minor  changes  of 
the other paths. The total effect of reputation 
on  affective  loyalty  is  now  0.525  (0.384    + 
[0.558 × 0.252] ⬵ 0.525). The remaining indi-
rect  effect  of  reputation  on  behavioral  loy-
alty  via  satisfaction  and  affective  loyalty  is 

0.342 ([0.558 × 0.252 × 0.318]    +    [0.558 × 0.445]    +   
[0.384 × 0.318] ⬵ 0.342).  The  direct  path   d  
from reputation to affective loyalty is strong-
er than the direct effect of satisfaction onto 
affective loyalty (path  b ). To test the strength 
of these relationships, we use the procedure 
explained by  Cohen  et al . (2003) . This test is 
used to investigate the signiﬁ cance of the dif-
ference between dependent correlation coef-
ﬁ cients  determined  from  the  same  sample. 
The relationship between satisfaction and af-
fective  loyalty  (  ♢   11     =    0.252)  is  signiﬁ cantly 
weaker  ( z     =        −    3.857;   p     =    0.01)  than  the  rela-
tionship between reputation and affective loy-
alty (  ♤   21     =    0.384). Following the same proce-
dure,  we  also  test  the  strength  of  the 
relationships between satisfaction and the two 
kinds of loyalty. The relationship between sat-
isfaction and affective loyalty (  ♢   11     =    0.252) is 
only  just  signiﬁ cantly  weaker  ( z     =        −    2.986; 
 p     =    0.01) than the relationship between repu-
tation and behavioral loyalty (  ♢   21     =    0.445). 

 As  PLS  aims  at  explaining  variances 
( Fornell and Bookstein, 1982 ), an evaluation 
of PLS-models has to apply prediction-ori-
ented measures. Assessing the reﬁ ned model, 
the  R -squares of the dependent latent vari-
ables have to be interpreted. The  R  2 -values 
are 0.312 for the satisfaction construct, 0.320 
for affective loyalty, and 0.430 for behavioral

 DISCUSSION 
 The  present  study  contributes  to  a  better 
knowledge of the interplay between corpo-
rate  reputation,  satisfaction  of  investors, 
and  loyalty  (research  questions  1  and  2). 
Furthermore,  the  role  of  reputation  in  in-
vestment  decision  making  can  be  discussed 
taking  into  account  the  study  ﬁ ndings 
(research question 3). 

 All but one of the proposed relationships 
have  been  supported  by  the  data.  Taking 
into account reputation ’ s considerable effect 
on  affective  loyalty,  reputation  might  partly 
compensate  for  an  investor ’ s  own  experi-
ences with a ﬁ rm reﬂ ected in his / her degree 
of satisfaction, so that short-term deviations 
in share price or dividends paid do not lead 
to  immediate  downturn  of  the  emotional 
predisposition of an investor towards his / her 
ﬁ rm.  This  is  especially  noteworthy  when 
taking into account the relatively low inﬂ u-
ence  of  satisfaction  on  affective  loyalty.  As 
conﬁ rmed  by   MacGregor   et  al .  (2000) ,  af-
fective evaluations of a ﬁ rm ’ s reputation may 
result in a discounting of other information 

that should be incorporated into a judgment 
of the investment value of a ﬁ rm. For cor-
porate  reputation  management,  this  might 
imply that  ‘ investing ’  in the ﬁ rm ’ s reputation 
has positive effects on the emotional predis-
position of individual investors. This lever to 
improve  affective  loyalty  has  hitherto  been 
neglected in reputation management, as well 
as investor relations. 

 While this ﬁ nding strengthens behavioral 
ﬁ nance  scientists ’   opinion  on  the  possibly 
misleading effect of emotions in investment 
decision  making  (   Kahneman  and  Riepe, 
1998 ;   Shefrin,  2001 ),  we  have  to  take  into 
account the other part of loyalty as well. As 
we ascertain, satisfaction ’ s effect on behavio-
ral  loyalty  is  considerably  stronger  than  its 
effect on affective loyalty. There is  no signiﬁ -
cant effect  of reputation on behavioral loyalty 
meaning  that  reputation  is   not   a  forceful 
lever  to directly inﬂ uence  investors ’  future trad-
ing  intentions  or  the  holding  period  of 
shares.  But  one  has  to  be  aware  that  our 
study did not measure initial decision mak-
ing  on  behalf  of  ﬁ rst-time  buyers  of  shares 
who are usually focused on in works on be-
havioral  ﬁ nance.  Also,  the   indirect  effect   of 
corporate  reputation  on  behavioral  loyalty 
via  investor  satisfaction  needs  to  be  taken 

32

 Helm 

into  account.  It  is  not  a  strong  effect  (only 
about 12 per cent of the variance of behav-
ioral loyalty are explained by reputation), but 
given  the  assumed,  paramount  inﬂ uence  of 
ﬁ nancial  performance  data  on  the  decision 
to sell or hold stocks, this impact of reputa-
tion as a qualitative determinant of investor 
loyalty is quite striking. The ﬁ ndings, how-
ever, also imply that  ‘ good ’  companies ’  shares 
may  after  all  not  be  held  longer  than  bad 
companies ’  shares. Further evidence on rep-
utation ’ s role in investor decision making is 
called  for  to  address  research  question 
number 3 more exhaustively. 

 Regarding  the  conceptualization  of  the 
constructs, the revelation of some weak in-
dicators  merits  further  attention.  Concern-
ing  the  satisfaction  construct,  the  indicator 
termed  ‘ development of the share price ’  did 
not contribute sufﬁ ciently to the construct. 
This might be due to the high market vol-
atility  and  decreasing  stock  performance 
most investors had to face during the years 
prior  to  our  study.  Furthermore,  the  re-
spondents  might  be  more  interested  in  the 
safety of their investment as the pronounced 
weights of the dividend and investment-ori-
ented  indicators  suggest. The  data  did  not 
indicate whether there were different types 
of  investors  according  to  their  investment 
interests, though. 

 In respect of the reputation construct, we 
eliminated  the  items  ‘ treatment  of  employ-
ees ’ ,   ‘ customer  orientation ’ ,  and   ‘ ﬁ nancial 
performance ’ . One might expect the former 
two  items  to  be  of  minor  relevance,  they 
seem  to  inﬂ uence  investor ’ s  perception  of 
the  esteem  a  ﬁ rm  is  held  in  to  a  minimal 
degree. The latter item  –  ﬁ nancial perform-
ance  –  was expected to be relevant, though. 
But while ﬁ nancial strength is an important 
factor to institutional investors (and analysts), 
it does not always have to be a decisive fac-
tor for individual investors ( Gregory, 1998 ). 
As  reported,  individual  investors  did  not 
name ﬁ nancial performance as a speciﬁ c fac-
tor affecting their perception of a company ’ s 

reputation  in  the  preliminary  interviews. 
Likewise, study respondents might have been 
of  the  opinion  that  ﬁ nancial  performance 
data  are  not  of  interest  to  the  public  and 
consequently do not contribute to the crea-
tion of corporate reputation as perceived by 
the general public, whereas overall success of 
the  company  as  captured  in  the  indicator 
called  ‘ corporate  success ’   is  very  important 
in the creation of reputation. Within the set 
of  reputation  indicators,  this  one  has  the 
highest weight. In the eyes of individual in-
vestors,  reputation  is  furthermore  captured 
to  a  considerable  degree  by  non-ﬁ nancial 
items  such  as   ‘ commitment  to  social  and 
charitable issues ’ .   

 LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION 
 In  a  behavioral  research  study  like  the 
current  survey,  common  method  bias  is  a 
potential  problem  that  needs  to  be  consid-
ered because such biases pose a rival expla-
nation  for  the  strength  of  the  relationships 
between  constructs  ( Podsakoff   et  al .,  2003 ). 
Controlling for methods biases can refer to 
the  design  of  the  study  procedures  ( ex  ante  
techniques) or to statistical controls ( ex post  
techniques).  The  latter  are  applicable  to 
reﬂ ective  models  but  pose  considerable 
problems  when  formative  construct  meas-
ures  are  involved.  While  the   ‘ goal  of  the 
statistical control procedures [ … ] is to obtain 
an estimate of the relationship between the 
constructs and measures that partials out the 
effect of method bias ’  ( Podsakoff  et al ., 2003: 
900 ), this is impossible concerning formative 
constructs  because  ‘ the  method  factor  does 
not enter into the equation where the rela-
tionship  between  the  formative  measures 
and  the  construct  is  estimated ’   ( Podsakoff 
 et  al .,  2003:  900 ). The  authors  explain  that 
the effects of method bias on formative con-
structs  should  be  modeled  at  the  construct 
level rather than at the item level  –  but un-
fortunately, such models are under-identiﬁ ed 
( Podsakoff  et al ., 2003 ). They therefore con-
clude  that  ‘ procedural  controls  are  likely  to

 Role of Corporate Reputation 

be  the  most  effective  way  to  control  com-
mon  measurement  biases ’   ( Podsakoff   et  al ., 
2003:  900 ).  Considering  the  study  at  hand, 
this was done by following a number of sug-
gestions taken from the literature to remedy 
biases  such  as  using  introductory  sections 
for  each  question  (short   ‘ cover  stories ’   as 
proposed  by   Podsakoff   et  al .,  2003 ),  item 
randomization,  multiple  pretest  steps  to 
improve scale items including deﬁ nitions of 
ambiguous terms (ie reputation) and testing 
for question simplicity and comprehensibil-
ity, using different scale endpoints and verbal 
labels for all points of the scales while assess-
ing  that  none  of  these  adaptations  should 
jeopardize the validity of the scales. 

 A further possible obstacle is that the sam-
ple of our study was reduced to investors of 
one  speciﬁ c  ﬁ rm.  An  inter-sectoral  study 
should be conducted to provide further in-
sights,  especially  to  ﬁ nd  out  more  about 
reputation ’ s  impact  on  investor  decision 
making  and  the  assumption  that  individual 
investors  ‘ irrationally ’   prefer  ‘ good ’   compa-
nies ’  stocks. An analysis across companies and 
industries could also show whether there are 
industry effects on the inﬂ uence of reputa-
tion  onto  satisfaction  and  loyalty.  Speciﬁ c 
types  of  investors  might  be  satisﬁ ed  with 
and / or loyal to stocks of companies with bad 
reputations or to companies that belong to 
an  industry  that  is  generally  disliked  (eg 
tobacco  companies,  companies  producing 
weapons, oil companies). In these cases, in-
dividual  investors  might  be  attracted  by 
other  company / stock  characteristics.  Also, 
reliance on corporate reputation as a signal 
might  be  used  to  discern  different  types  of 
individual investors as it might correlate with 
investors ’   afﬁ nity  to  accept  risk  levels. Also, 
it would be interesting to compare individ-
ual and institutional investors ’  perceptions of 
reputation  and  reputation ’ s  impact  on  their 
investment choices. 

 If  reputation  plays  an  important  role  in 
establishing relationships with investors, the 
dynamics of this effect might be investigated. 

A  longitudinal  study  could  show  how  the 
importance  of  reputation  evolves  in  an  in-
vestor ’ s  relationship  to  a  ﬁ rm.  As  the  data 
have provided evidence for an effect of rep-
utation  on  satisfaction  and  affective  loyalty, 
moderators  of  these  effects  might  be  taken 
into account. Such moderators might com-
prise investor involvement, expertise, income, 
wealth, investment strategy, prior share per-
formance, etc. Also, cognitive dissonance that 
is deemed an important construct in behav-
ioral  ﬁ nance  might  be  included  in  future 
structural equation models to build a larger 
nomological network. 

 The  present  study  extends  previous  re-
search  on  reputation  and  investor  behavior 
in two important ways. First, a model is pro-
posed that incorporates novel concepts that 
have been hitherto neglected in research on 
reputation  and  on  investor  behavior  alike. 
Few  studies  have  attempted  to  address  the 
antecedent factors leading to loyalty ( Abdullah 
 et  al .,  2000 ),  or  to  investigate  (long-term) 
investor behavior on a micro-level. Reputa-
tion has been found to have a direct inﬂ u-
ence on affective loyalty, and an indirect one 
on behavioral loyalty. 

 Second, by revealing evidence on the loy-
alty  effect  of  reputation,  the  ﬁ ndings  high-
light  the  strategic  importance  of  corporate 
reputation. In other stakeholder settings, loy-
alty is constantly considered a pre-econom-
ic  performance  measure  and  an  overall 
success  factor  of  the  ﬁ rm  (eg   Hallowell, 
1996 ). Investor loyalty is interpreted as a fac-
tor in reducing volatility and cost of capital 
( Gregory,  1998 ).  Furthermore,  it  might  be 
associated with customer loyalty because  ‘ in-
vestors are also consumers, and they talk to 
other  consumers ’   ( Hunt,  1952:  105 ).   Uhl 
(1962)   claims  investors  to  be  among  the 
most loyal customers of a ﬁ rm. Whether in-
creasing investor loyalty does positively affect 
a  ﬁ rm ’ s  performance  as  we  proposed  at 
the  outset  of  our  investigation,  remains 
to be studied, though. Owing to the distinc-
tive  interest  in  loyalty  in  other  stakeholder

settings,  it  certainly  appears  worthwhile  to 
conduct research into this ﬁ eld which is so 
strongly connected to previous research en-
deavors  in  the  discipline  of  behavioral 
ﬁ nance.
