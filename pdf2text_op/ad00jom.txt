Design management and process management are two important elements of total quality management TQM
implementation. They are drastically different in their targets of improvement, visibility, and techniques. In this paper, we
establish a framework for identifying the synergistic linkages of design and process management to the operational quality
.
outcomes during the manufacturing process internal quality and upon the field usage of the products external quality .
Through a study of quality practices in 418 manufacturing plants from multiple industries, we empirically demonstrate that
both design and process management efforts have an equal positive impact on internal quality outcomes such as scrap,
rework, defects, performance, and external quality outcomes such as complaints, warranty, litigation, market share. A
detailed contingency analysis shows that the proposed model of synergies between design and process management holds
true for large and small firms; for firms with different levels of TQM experience; and in different industries with varying
levels of competition, logistical complexity of production, or production process characteristics. Finally, the results also
suggest that organizational learning enables mature TQM firms to implement both design and process efforts more
rigorously and their synergy helps these firms to attain better quality outcomes. These findings indicate that, to attain
superior quality outcomes, firms need to balance their design and process management efforts and persevere with long-term
implementation of these efforts. Because the study spans all of the manufacturing sectors SIC 20 through 39 , these
conclusions should help firms in any industry revisit their priorities in terms of the relative efforts in design management and
process management. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

mentation, they are drastically different in their tar-
gets of improvement, visibility, and techniques. De-
sign management efforts are targeted toward improv-
ing product designs while process management
strives for quality improvement
in manufacturing
techniques and processes. Design management ef-
forts involve long-term work in the background while
process management is usually more visible yet tac-
tical. Finally, they involve different managerial and
technical tools.

The manufacturing strategy literature has viewed
product quality as one of the major competitive
priorities for attaining a sustainable competitive ad-
vantage Hill, 1994 . Recently, the speed of new
product introduction has also been added to this list
of priorities Kim, 1996 . From a quality manage-
ment perspective, the speed of new product design
and development indicates the importance of design-
ing quality into new products. Because design efforts
often have a limiting impact on attainable product
quality, several researchers have stressed the impor-
tance of designing quality into products Juran, 1981;
Juran and Gryna, 1993; Hauser and Clausing, 1988;
Dean and Susman, 1989; Taguchi and Clausing,
1990; Boothroyd et al., 1994; Mizuno and Akao,

Although the inherent design of products and
processes is important, firms have to ensure a consis-
tent and cost effective attainment of the desired
product quality during production. Conformance
quality relates to the need for managing production
processes to yield products adhering to expected
specifications. Several researchers emphasize process
quality management and quality assurance as a way
of achieving high manufacturing quality Robinson
and Schroeder, 1990; Benton, 1991; Everett and
Sohal, 1991; Chen and Tirupati, 1995 . Deming
(cid:14)
1986 advocated efficient process management, open
communication, and systematic identification and re-
moval of defects and their causes in the process.
According to Deming, higher process quality results
from efforts to attribute quality problems to system
or process instead of workers. This in turn will yield
high quality products.

(cid:14)

Designing quality into products and managing
production quality should both impact quality. Yet,
few studies have touched upon the relative impor-
tance of these two phases of quality management.

One such study, The American Quality Foundation
and Ernst and Young study 1992 suggested that
high quality performance firms invested more efforts
in design management while low quality perfor-
mance firms focused on inspections. However, the
results of this study were published without disclos-
ing the methodology and statistical analyses. Hence,
its conclusions cannot be generalized Hendricks and
.
Singhal, 1997 . Radhakrishnan and Srinidhi 1994
presented a framework for determining whether qual-
ity should be designed into or inspected into prod-
ucts. Flynn et al. 1995 empirically tested the rela-
tionship among several elements of quality manage-
ment. They reported inconclusive results about the
relative impact of design management and process
management on manufacturing quality. Greene
(cid:14)
1993 suggested that a firm with global quality
visions should pursue the use of almost one hundred
specific quality tools, ranging from problem report-
ing and resolution to quality function deployment.
Recently, Jayaram et al. 1997 found that typically
about 38 of these tools were used in various manu-
facturing firms. They identified the tools with signif-
icant relationships to various aspects of product qual-
ity such as aesthetics, reliability, and serviceability.
They also identified significant tools associated with
relatively high or low emphasis on each of the
following four strategies: inspection, process control,
process improvement, and design quality. However,
they did not specifically study the relative net impact
of the use of these strategies on either process or
product quality. While these studies reported some
useful observations on the relevance of design and
process management in quality efforts, a systematic
analysis of the net impact of these two components
of TQM efforts on outcomes has not been under-
taken. In this paper, we present an empirical investi-
gation of the role of design and process management
in quality outcomes of manufacturing firms.

2. Model

The primary objective of our research is to exam-
ine the relative role of design and process manage-
ment on operational quality results at the plant level.
We address several questions: 1 Does design man-
agement affect
the internally measured quality of

internal quality ?
(cid:14) .2 Does it affect the customer perception of the
quality of products upon field usage external qual-
ity ? 3 Does process management affect the inter-
nal and external quality? 4 Do design and process
management affect operational quality to the same
extent? 5 Is the relative influence of design and
process management on the operational quality con-
tingent upon organizational context variables such as
size, quality management experience, and industry?
We incorporate these questions in the form of a
conceptual model shown in Fig. 1 that integrates the
hypotheses developed in this section. The constructs
used in developing our model are defined and the
literature support for them is summarized in Table 1.
To describe the hypothesized linkages of design and
process management with quality outcomes more
clearly, we first discuss the relevant elements of
internal and external quality. This discussion is fol-
lowed by the components of design and process
management and their relationships in our model.

2.1. External and internal quality outcomes

The notion that overall market and business per-
formance can be realized through long-term product
quality improvement is a cornerstone of the contem-
porary quality revolution George and Weimerskirch,
1994; NIST, 1998 . Customers form their impres-

(cid:14)

sions about a firm’s products based upon their cur-
rent and past experience with these products Garvin,
1987 . A satisfactory field performance of the prod-
ucts is accompanied by lower customer dissatisfac-
tion, greater customer loyalty, and improved market
share Crosby, 1979; Buzzell and Gale, 1987; Hardie,
1998 . We label this aspect of quality outcome as
external quality because it is related to the customer’s
perspective of the products upon field usage. It
captures Juran’s ‘‘fitness for use’’ dimension of
.
product quality Juran, 1981; Juran and Gryna, 1993 .
Specifically, we focus our attention on four long-term
indicators of external quality: warranty work, litiga-
tion claims, customer complaints, and market share.
Of these, warranty and litigation claims and cus-
tomer complaints refer to the external quality failure
costs Juran and Gryna, 1993 . Market share also has
been directly associated with the customer percep-
tion of a firm’s products based on recent and past
usage Buzzell and Gale, 1987; Reeves and Bednar,
1994; Flynn et al., 1995; Larson and Sinha, 1995;
Hardie, 1998 . Based on support from TQM litera-
.
ture Dawson and Patrickson, 1991; Ahire, 1996 ,
in these indicators over a
we used improvement
3-year time frame to measure firms’ performance
along external quality outcomes.

Internal quality captures the ability of a manufac-
turing plant to produce products conforming to their
designed quality at an economic production cost.

Thus,
it can be viewed as the ‘‘conformance to
requirement’’ dimension of quality as specified by
Crosby 1979, 1996 . We specifically consider five
measures of internal quality: scrap rate, rework rate,
defect rate, internal reliability test performance prior
to shipping, and manufacturing productivity. The
performance of finished products in final tests and
the proportion of defective units of production are
widely used indicators of conformance quality at the
end of the production process Crosby, 1979, 1996;
.
Reeves and Bednar, 1994; Jayaram et al., 1997 .
However, a lower percent of outgoing defective units
can come at great cost if in-production quality is not
assured. Efficient processes have been associated
with improved manufacturing productivity Schon-
berger, 1986 . The cost efficiency of a production
process is reflected in the scrap and rework gener-
ated during production. They represent internal qual-
ity failure costs Juran and Gryna, 1993 . Scrap and
rework have been used as appropriate indicators of

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

internal quality Flynn et al., 1995; Grandzol and
Gershon, 1998 . Therefore, we include manufactur-
ing productivity as a supplementary measure of in-
ternal quality. Using the same literature support as
that for external quality Dawson and Patrickson,
1991; Ahire, 1996 , we used improvement in the
aforementioned indicators over a 3-year time frame
to measure firms’ performance along internal quality
outcomes.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

The quality of products passing internal tests of
reliability should affect the experience of customers
who use the products in two prominent ways. First,
customers perceive product quality in terms of their
net value defined as the ratio of performance to
cost: Artzt, 1992 . Thus, for products with the same
performance levels, lower price will drive customer
choice and satisfaction. Second, customers willing to
spend a certain amount of money will choose the
products that offer maximum performance for that
money. Hence, scrap and rework costs should influ-

.

ence external quality due to their impact on the
denominator of the value equation. The performance
and reliability of the product also should affect the
external quality indicators of customer satisfaction
(cid:14)i.e. complaints, warranty,
litigation, and market
share . A lower percentage of defective products
should help a firm to reinforce positive customer
experience Hardie, 1998 . Therefore, we propose
the following hypothesis.

.

.

(cid:14)

Hypothesis 1. Internal quality has a positi˝e effect
on external quality.

2.2. Product design performance

Effective product design performance has been
used as an important market leadership tool by suc-
cessful firms in competitive industries. From the
available literature, we identified two major dimen-
sions of this competitive capability: new product
development speed and number of components in
products. The first dimension explains the ability of
a firm to frequently offer new products and new
designs to customers. Rubbermaid’s introduction of
new products at a rate of more than one per day or
Sony’s flooding of the electronics market by simulta-
neously displaying more than 25 models of the same
product e.g. Walkman illustrate this ability Chase
et al., 1998 . However, the product variety offered
by a firm depends upon the speed of product devel-
opment. For example, the number of US car models
for sale in the US rose from 38 to 50 between 1973
and 1989. During the same period, the number of
Japanese car models for sale in the US rose from 19
to 58.

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

.

This capability of firms to outperform competitors
based on product variety has been traced to two
major outcomes of the product design process. The
first source is the speed of new product development.
The Japanese firms spent an average of 1.7 million h
of engineering and a total of 46 months on develop-
ment of a new model while their US counterparts
spent an average of 3.1 million engineering h and
about 60 months to develop a new model Womack
et al., 1990 . The second source of competitive
capability of new product designs is design simplifi-
cation and component standardization. They both

(cid:14)

.

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

affect product cost and performance through their
impact on the number of parts used in the product.
This was illustrated when NCR replaced its cash
register model 2160 with the newer design model
2760 in the 1980s. Because of an improved design
which resulted in an 85% reduction in the number of
parts used, the model 2760 required only 25% of the
assembly time as required by its predecessor, the
model 2160. The new model also reduced the num-
ber of parts and subassemblies supplied by outside
sources by 65%, thus saving on direct and indirect
material costs Port, 1989 . The importance of design
simplification and parts reduction is further illus-
trated by Toyota’s introduction of a more powerful
engine at 33% less cost which was the result of a
33% reduction in the number of engine parts used
previously and allowed Toyota to surge ahead of its
competition Wall Street Journal, November 11,
1996 . Finally, component standardization across
product lines reduces the cost of production signifi-
cantly through its impact on inventories and allows
employees to focus on fewer parts Schonberger,
1986; Melnyk and Denzler, 1996 . Hence, we used
the speed of new product development and compo-
nents reduction in product designs as two major
indicators of product design performance. However,
since design cycle times can vary widely across
industries, we did not measure product design perfor-
mance using a specific time frame such as 3 years.
As the foregoing discussion shows, product de-
sign performance should directly affect both external
quality and internal quality. First, better product
designs and faster new product
introductions win
over and retain customers. Also, agile innovators can
better anticipate and respond to customers’ current
and latent needs and preferences. Hence, agile firms
should have fewer customer dissatisfaction problems.
Such firms should also be able to maintain market
leadership in their industry. Therefore, we propose
the following hypothesis.

(cid:14)

.

Hypothesis 2. Product design performance has a
positi˝e effect on external quality.

The product design efforts of product innovators
are usually focused on introducing not only more but
better products. Such efforts take into account manu-
facturability of the proposed products. As the exam-

.

(cid:14)

ples of NCR and Toyota suggest, design simplifica-
tion and components reduction are important hall-
marks of good design performance. Parts reductions
allow workers to produce new products faster by
working with previously designed and built compo-
nents for which costs, standards, bills of materials,
and lead times are already known Melnyk and
Denzler, 1996 . Because process complexity is a
function of design complexity, a lower number of
parts per product should result in more streamlined
production. For example, as NCR’s design improve-
ment suggests, fewer and standardized components
result in lower inventory costs and easier manage-
ment of inventory Port, 1989 . Simplified produc-
tion and workers’ prior experience with standardized
parts should also result in lower scrap and rework
and fewer defective units Schonberger, 1986 . This
leads us to the following hypothesis.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

Hypothesis 3. Product design performance has a
positi˝e effect on internal quality.

2.3. Process quality management

(cid:14)

.

.

Deming 1986 was a prominent proponent of
process quality management as a means of optimiz-
ing process performance. According to Taguchi
(cid:14)
1987 , the cost of non-conformance of quality in-
creases at an increasing rate with the magnitude of
non-conformance.
Inferior quality manufacturing
processes consume more resources due to scrap and
rework of work-in-process and of the finished prod-
ucts. This also leads to high defect rates and rejec-
tions at final inspection stage. Hence, process quality
management has been frequently cited as a major
dimension of integrated quality efforts Imai, 1986;
.
Shingo, 1986; Anderson et al., 1995 .

(cid:14)

Process quality management essentially involves
identifying critical components of the manufacturing
processes and improving them to ensure the superior
quality of products at economic costs. Researchers
have stressed the importance of identifying appropri-
ate process quality improvement opportunities be-
cause of their significant impact on cost reduction,
quality improvement, and organizational positive re-
inforcement of such efforts Spector and Beer, 1994;
Ahire, 1997 . Ahire and Rana 1995 suggest that

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

.

.

process improvement projects be prioritized and ef-
forts be focused on key processes that show signifi-
cant potential payoffs and visibility. Hence, we used
selection of key processes for improvement as an
indicator of process quality management efforts.

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

(cid:14) .

(cid:14)
(cid:14) .

Process quality management can be viewed as a
continuing four-step process: 1 selecting key pro-
cesses through prioritization, typically, based on cost
. (cid:14) .
of quality considerations Ahire and Rana, 1995 , 2
identifying the root causes of problems in selected
processes through the use of quality tools and identi-
fying improvement
strategies Robinson and
. (cid:14) .
Schroeder, 1990 , 3 implementing the changes us-
ing corrective actions ranging from error-proofing
techniques to resetting local parameters to complete
redesign of processes Shingo, 1986; Hammer and
Champy, 1993 , and 4 measuring the improve-
ments in the process Ahire, 1997 . Juran 1981 and
Deming 1986 have both stressed the importance of
scrap and rework measurement throughout the manu-
facturing process for identifying key processes and
monitoring improvement in problem areas. Deming
(cid:14)
1986 has also specifically advocated the use of
statistical process control SPC to track process
performance for
in-production quality assurance.
Hence, we used the following measures of process
quality management: 1 monitoring of scrap and
rework, 2 application of SPC tools, 3 use of
corrective and prevention tools such as error proof-
ing, and 4 focus on key processes.

Process quality management should have a natural
impact on internal quality through its effect on the
amount of scrap and rework generated. As efforts are
made to identify problem areas in production and
corrective actions taken to eliminate the quality prob-
lems, a lower number of defective products will be
produced. Also, by Taguchi’s 1987 quadratic loss
function, tightening of the process parameters around
the optimum levels should lead to lower costs of
poor quality including defects, scrap, and rework.
Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:

(cid:14)

.

Hypothesis 4. Process quality management has a
positi˝e effect on internal quality.

In the last few years, firms have attempted to
establish direct communications between customers

(

555

and production employees to resolve customer com-
plaints, provide feedback about product quality, and
offer suggestions for future product improvements.
Dell Computer’s approach of the production team
directly handling the order fulfillment from cus-
tomers is based on the notion of bringing customers
closer to the actual production process for better
quality performance. Solectron a winner of
the
Baldrige Award in 1991 resolves customer com-
plaints from its industrial customers by: a identify-
ing the out-of-control components of the manufactur-
ing process, b revisingrimproving the process to
bring it under control, and c tightening the toler-
ance limits on the process using statistical tools if the
process
is already under control George and
Weimerskirch, 1994 . To test the effectiveness of
such strategies, we propose the following hypothesis:

.

Hypothesis 5. Process quality management has a
positi˝e effect on external quality.

2.4. Design management

In Section 2.2, we identified superior product
design performance as an antecedent to high internal
and external quality. However, the literature on prod-
uct innovation suggests that the design management
process largely determines the product design perfor-
mance Rosenthal, 1992; Wheelwright and Clark,
1992 . Hence,
researchers have identified design
management as an important element of integrated

innovator firms first

It is possible to summarize several characteristics
of an effective design management process from the
new product design and innovation literature. Suc-
cessful
identify current and
latent customer needs in a timely fashion. They
translate these identified needs into relevant new
product concepts or improved features of existing
products. Finally,
they introduce
these innovations into the market before competitors
(cid:14)
.
Deschamps and Nayak, 1995; Cohen et al., 1996 .
However, while speed of executing this cycle is
important, effectiveness of the design process may
be undermined if accuracy and consistency of the

they ensure that

execution is compromised. For example, the rush to
market a new product may compromise identifica-
tion of customer needs and thus result in irrelevant
products. Similarly, if manufacturability and process
considerations are ignored, excellent product ideas
may not result in high quality products, thus failing
the promising designs Dean and Susman, 1989;
Boothroyd et al., 1994; Kessler and Chakrabarti,
.
1996 .

.

The traditional approach to design consisted of
compartmentalized and myopic organization with de-
sign engineers and R&D technologists forcing their
ideas of product and process improvements on the
marketing and production functions. This approach
often led to irrelevant and ineffective innovation
(cid:14)
Wheelwright and Clark, 1992 . Speed of product
development and quality of developed products are
critical to successful product design efforts. Rapid
and relevant design and innovation requires a cross-
functional organization and concurrent planningrde-
signing process Deschamps and Nayak, 1995 . The
concurrent engineering approach involves partici-
pants from all parts of the supply chain in the design
process Swink et al., 1996 . The participation of
customers and the marketing function in the design
process ensures that product designs are relevant to
customer needs. Timely feedback from the produc-
tion function ensures the technical feasibility of the
product ideas. Finally, coordination among the de-
sign, purchasing, and production functions improves
design and implementation of appropriate product–
process combinations, resulting in a cost-effective
.
production system Wheelwright and Clark, 1992 .
An effective design process organized in this manner
will be closely associated with specific design strate-
gies such as standardization of components across
various products and reduction in product compo-
nents.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

Several firms have used cross-functional teams
and concurrent engineering to reduce product design
cycle times and develop products that exceed cus-
tomer expectations Kochan, 1991; Rosenthal, 1992;
Deschamps and Nayak, 1995 . These cross-func-
tional practices typically suggest early interactions
among marketing, product design, manufacturing,
quality assurance, and new product development
functions Huthwaite, 1991; Kochan, 1991 . Interac-
tions between the design and quality assurance func-

.

tions are critical to understanding the linkage be-
tween pre- and post-production quality issues. On-
going interactions between the design and production
functions is essential to ensure that the original and
updated product designs are in agreement with the
capabilities of the current manufacturing configura-
tion. Finally, new product development
time and
‘‘ramp-up’’ time the time taken by the production
function to produce volume quantities of the new
product with acceptable levels of quality are both
important for quality and time-based performance.
Hence, the production function’s involvement in new
product development projects is essential. Bench-
marking has received considerable attention due to
its role in ensuring the competitiveness of a firm’s
products and processes Camp, 1989 . Finally, good
product design practices entail evaluation of product
designs from a manufacturing process perspective.
Advanced design techniques such as the design of
experiments can be useful in optimizing manufactur-
ing process considerations for new product designs
(cid:14)
Taguchi, 1987 . Thus, we measured a firm’s design
management efforts through the following items: use
of quality function deployment, use of design of
experiments in designing products and processes, use
of competitive benchmarking, and integrated in-
volvement of different levels of management, em-
ployees, functions, and customers and suppliers in
design efforts.

(cid:14)

.

.

Based on these characteristics of integrated design
practices, we measured organizations’ design man-
agement efforts based on the extent of use of ad-
vanced design organization and innovation execution
tools such as quality function deployment, cross-
functional
teams, concurrent engineering, bench-
marking, and design. To evaluate the impact of
design management on product design performance,
we propose the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 6. Design management has a positi˝e
effect on product design performance.

Design management practices identified above
should also affect the planning and coordination of
overall quality efforts. Quality management literature
has associated cross-functional integration of quality
efforts as an enabler of teamwork, cooperation, and

(cid:14)

quality-oriented culture Funk, 1992; Lawler et al.,
.
1992; Mirvis, 1997; Grandzol and Gershon, 1998 .
The same organizational members who participate in
the advanced design management practices also exe-
cute process quality management practices. Their
knowledge, experience, and attitudes regarding team-
work, cooperation, and customer focus should spill
over into the on-going efforts of tracking and im-
proving the quality of manufacturing processes. This
possibility leads to the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 7. Design management has a positi˝e
effect on process quality management.

2.5. Quality training

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

Quality training has probably been the most pub-
licized programmatic aspect of TQM implementa-
tion. It has been long recognized that well focused
quality training is essential to better quality manage-
.
ment Juran, 1981; Robinson and Schroeder, 1993 .
The success of process quality improvement efforts
is contingent upon the effectiveness of the actual
usage of process quality improvement
tools. The
effectiveness of
tools depends upon employees’
knowledge of the tools and management’s promotion
of these tools. The level of knowledge about tools
can be improved if the management ensures rigorous
quality training for managers and employees Gala-
gan, 1992; Svenson and Riderer, 1992 . Management
can actively promote the use of these tools by pro-
viding positive incentives and convincing employees
that initial errors in using the tools are acceptable
(cid:14)
Everett and Sohal, 1991 . Also, multi-skilled em-
ployees are more versatile and have a broader per-
spective of the manufacturing process. Thus,
the
following four items measure a firm’s quality train-
ing efforts: management and employee training in
quality controlrimprovement tools, multi-functional
training of employees, and actual use of process
qualityrimprovement tools.
that

training employees in
multiple-skills will enable them to better contribute
to process quality management Schonberger, 1986;
Melnyk and Denzler, 1996 . These influences of
quality training on process quality management are
captured in the following hypothesis.

Researchers suggest

Hypothesis 8. Quality training has a positi˝e effect
on process quality management.

Quality training typically involves training in pro-
cess control methods such as SPC tools. Specialized
quality training also entails training in managerial
problem-solving tools, group decision-making, and
design tools such as, quality function deployment
and design of experiments Modarress and Ansari,
1989; Svenson and Riderer, 1992 . The impact of
these specific design-related tools on product designs
is hypothesized as follows.

Hypothesis 9. Quality training has a positi˝e effect
on product design performance.

3. Contingency factors

Fig. 1 and the associated nine hypothesized paths
represent a conceptual model of the role of design
and process management in a manufacturing firm’s
internal and external quality outcomes. Although the
hypothesized model relationships are rooted in litera-
ture, we should not ignore the possibility that the
intensity of execution of various implementation
constructs and the resulting outcome constructs could
be contingent upon some organizational and industry
characteristics. Below, we identify some relevant
contextual factors and their potential impact on the
levels of the constructs in the model as well as on
the model relationships.

3.1. Firm size effects

Firm size is an important contingency factor for
several reasons. First, smaller firms have flatter orga-
nizational structures and more informal communica-
tion channels. Thus, because smaller factories are
more manageable, TQM elements such as process
quality management and design management maybe
more effectively applied in small firms Sonfield,
1984; Manoochehri, 1988 . Researchers have also
associated the smaller size and informal organiza-
tional structures of smaller organizations with their
abilities to encourage and implement
innovation
(cid:14)
Sironopolis, 1994 . On the other hand, larger firms

(cid:14)

.

.

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

have more market clout, capital resources, and pro-
fessional managerial expertise Finch, 1986 . To our
.
knowledge, only one study Ahire and Golhar, 1996
has compared TQM implementation in large firms
(cid:14)
more than 250 employees and small firms 250 or
fewer employees . Those researchers reported that
while large and small firms did not differ signifi-
cantly along design quality management, small firms
did implement SPC usage to a higher extent than
large firms. A closer examination of high product
quality firms indicated that large high quality firms
implemented design quality management and SPC
usage more intensively than their small counterparts.
Considering the literature support for distinctions
between small and large firms in the general man-
agement domain and a relative paucity of research in
the quality management area with the aforemen-
tioned exception, we investigated the effect of firm
size on our model through the following propositions
.
(cid:14)
in null form :

Proposition 1. The le˝els of model constructs are
not affected by firm size.

Proposition 2. The model relationships are not af-
fected by firm size.

3.2. TQM duration effects

(cid:14)

The organizational learning theory proposes that
TQM implementation effectiveness will increase with
.
TQM maturity in a firm. According to Garvin 1993 ,
this organizational
learning is associated with an
organization’s ability to explore the unknown and to
identify and pursue novel solutions. In the context of
our model, as TQM implementation matures, a firm
may be able to maintain reliability of current produc-
tion processes, and yet swing toward performing
even better on design management and discovering a
.
higher number of new products Sitkin et al., 1994 .
Thus, greater familiarity with TQM implementation
elements may allow a firm to use their resources
more effectively as time goes on, focusing more
attention on issues like product design and long-term
innovations while being able to maintain good per-
formance along the tactical process management di-
mensions with relatively lower efforts. According to

Anderson et al. 1995 , organizational learning refers
to the organizational capability to recognize and
nurture the development of its skills, abilities, and
knowledge. They identified organizational learning
as one of the cornerstones of Deming’s theory of
quality management and suggested that learning in-
fluences process management. Though individual or-
ganizations may differ in their ability to learn, the
pervading nature of TQM programs should necessi-
tate adequate time first for the creation of TQM
infrastructure Ahire, 1996 and then for substantial
.
organizational learning Melnyk and Denzler, 1996 .
TQM implementation of 3 years has been used as an
adequate time-frame to evaluate outcomes of TQM
campaigns Dawson and Patrickson, 1991; Ahire,
1996 . Hence, we test the following propositions.

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

.

Proposition 3. The le˝els of model constructs are
not affected by TQM duration.

Proposition 4. The model relationships are not af-
fected by TQM duration.

3.3. Industry effects

(cid:14)

Type of industry could have moderating effects
on the model relationships for several reasons. First,
adoption and implementation rigor of technological
and managerial innovations has been linked to the
industry structural characteristics such as domestic
.
and global competitive environment Porter, 1991 .
The higher the volatility and global competitive chal-
lenges of an industry, the higher the incentive for
implementing such initiatives. For example, the auto-
motive and computer industries have adopted con-
temporary operations improvement strategies such as
TQM to a much greater extent as compared to more
stable industries such as pulp and paper or clay and
glass. Second, industries also differ in terms of types
of products and production processes. For example,
the chemical industry primarily uses batch and con-
tinuous manufacturing processes whereas the auto-
motive or computer industry relies heavily on modu-
lar assembly line production. Schmenner 1986 clas-
sified industry SIC groups into three categories based
on the logistical complexity of their production pro-

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

cesses measured by number of steps in the produc-
tion process . He concluded that the inherent nature
of processes could impact
the ability of various
industries to implement individual elements of pro-
ductivity improvement techniques. Funk 1995 fur-
ther used Schmenner’s classification and argued that
the logistical complexity of a production system will
affect the relevance of various operations improve-
ment techniques. For example, teamwork and coop-
eration are of greater significance in logistically
complex production systems such as automobile and
computer assembly than in low logistical complexity
production processes such as chemicals or food pro-
cessing Funk, 1995 . Schmenner 1986 and Funk
(cid:14)
1995 classification coded SIC groups 20 through
33 as low logistical complexity industries and SIC
34 through 38 as high logistical complexity indus-
tries.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

.

.

.

(cid:14)

Coincidentally, the high logistical complexity in-
dustries electrical machinery, fabricated metal prod-
ucts, industrial machinery, transportation equipment,
electronics, and instrumentation have also experi-
enced fiercer global competition and use of advanced
manufacturing technologies as compared to the low
logistical complexity industries Kotha and Vadla-
mani, 1995 . Moreover, these categories are synony-
mous to classification of process-type production
industries SIC 20 through 33 versus discrete-type
production industries SIC 34 through 38 Swami-
dass and Kotha, 1998 . Hence, we test the impact of
the differing intensity of competition, differing logis-
tical complexity of production, and differing produc-
tion processes across industries on our hypothesized
model through the following propositions.

. (cid:14)

(cid:14)
.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

.

Proposition 5. The le˝els of model constructs are
not affected by the industry characteristics of compe-
tition, logistical complexity, or production processes.

Proposition 6. The model relationships are not af-
fected by the industry characteristics of competition,
logistical complexity, or production processes.

ment practices on operational performance of manu-
facturing plants in multiple industries. To assess the
broader research questions, a comprehensive survey
instrument, consisting of 115 question items, was
developed in the main study. The main instrument
was intended to examine several different organiza-
tional management issues.

.

industry managers were asked to review the
original proposed instrument and refine it to enhance
the readability, clarity, and comprehensiveness of
the measurement instrument. A second test of con-
tentrface validity was conducted with the redesigned
questionnaire using a different group of ASQ mem-
bers. Minor changes were suggested and the recom-
mendations were incorporated into the final ques-
tionnaire. In addition, a pilot-test was conducted at a
local chapter of ASQ.

ducted to compare all of the responses along each
variable across the first, second, and third wave
(cid:14)
Armstrong and Overton, 1977 . The test did not
reveal any significant difference between the waves.
In addition, the three waves were not significantly
different in terms of number of employees, revenue,
and unionization. These tests suggested that the sam-
ple responses were representative of the general pop-
ulation.

.

For this paper, we used 30 quality management
related items from the original instrument that mea-
sured the six constructs of the proposed model.
These are presented in Appendix A. All items on the
current research instrument were measured using a
seven-point Likert scale 1sstrongly disagree, 7s
strongly agree . Based on listwise elimination of
responses corresponding to these 30 items, we used a
response sample of 418 plants spanning 20 SIC
groups SIC 20 through 39 for this research paper.

olds without a substantial reduction in the content
validity of constructs. Four items were eliminated
from the original 30 items. These are denoted in
Appendix A with an asterisk. The loadings of indi-
vidual retained items on corresponding constructs are
indicated next to each item. Most of the loadings are
above 0.6 suggesting that the items align well with
their respective constructs.

The current research instrument consisting of 30
items listed in Appendix A was refined prior to
testing the proposed model. For this purpose, a con-
firmatory factor analysis of the initial measurement
model was conducted using LISREL 8.2 Joreskog
and Sorbom, 1998 . The initial measurement model
with all 30 items resulted in an inadequate fit x %
dfs5.5, goodness of fit indexs0.77, standardized
root mean squared residuals0.087, adjusted good-
ness of fit indexs0.72, normed fit indexs0.81,
non-normed fit indexs0.82, comparative fit index
.s0.84 .

(cid:14)

The initial measurement model was refined using
standard CFA refinement procedures Hair et al.,
1998; Koufturos, 1999 as follows. The itemrs with
excessive standardized residuals and modification
indices were identified and eliminated one at a time.
The absolute model fit indices GFI, x %df ratio,
SRMR were analyzed along with incremental and
comparative indices AGFI, NFI, NNFI, CFI at each
iteration. Researchers have cautioned against statis-
tics-driven indefinite refinement without regard to
the item’s relevance to the theory and content valid-
ity Hair et al., 1998 . Thus, we stopped refinement
upon attaining generally acceptable model fit thresh-

Table 3 summarizes the model fit of the final
refined measurement model, scale descriptive statis-
.
tics, and correlations. For large samples, x %df
ratios as high as 8, NNFI values as low as 0.86 and
CFI values as low as 0.88 have been considered
adequate indicators of measurement model fit Doll
et al., 1998 . Thus, considering the large size and
heterogeneity of our sample, the model fit indices
(cid:14)
see Table 3 demonstrate that the refined model fits
the data well. Of the 15 scale correlations, 9 are
below 0.50. In general, process quality management
has high correlations with other constructs while
product design performance has low correlations.
The internal quality–external quality pair exhibits
the highest correlation 0.75 . These ranges of corre-
lations are high as would be expected for constructs
in integrated quality efforts. They are comparable in
ranges to correlations reported in other studies in

quality management Ahire et al., 1996 .

ensure that the refined scales represent reliable and
valid measurements of the underlying constructs.
Statistical validation of constructs includes specific
assessment of convergent and discriminant validity
(cid:14)
Hair et al., 1998 . However, unidimensionality and
reliability of scales are prerequisites to assessment of
convergent and discriminant validity Carmines and
Zeller, 1979; Anderson and Gerbing, 1991 . Hence,
indices of scale unidimensionality, reliability, cover-
gent validity, and discriminant validity are reported
in Table 4.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

.

The unidimensionality goodness of fit index indi-
cates the extent to which the scale items are strongly
associated with each other and represent a single
concept Hattie, 1985 . Typically, goodness of fit
index values of 0.90 or higher indicate high evidence
of unidimensionality Ahire et al., 1996 . All of the
scales exhibited high satisfactory unidimensionality.
Two scale reliability indices are reported: Cronbach’s
.
a Cronbach, 1951 and Werts–Linn–Joreskog rc
coefficients Werts et al., 1974 . Alpha values of
0.70 or higher and r values of 0.50 or higher
provide evidence of good scale reliability O’Leary-
Kelly and Vokurka, 1998 . All of the refined scales
have high values of both reliability indices.

Convergent validity is the extent to which varying
approaches to construct measurement yield the same
results Campbell and Fiske, 1959 . We report the
Bentler–Bonett normed fit index D as a measure of
convergent validity for each scale. All of the scales
exceed the threshold of 0.90 for this index Ahire et
.
al., 1996 .
Finally,

the high scale correlations warranted
careful assessment of discriminant validity of the
constructs. Discriminant validity assesses the extent
to which a concept and its indicators differ from
another concept and its indicators Bagozzi et al.,
1991 . Discriminant validity of constructs can be
assessed in different ways. First, adequate discrimi-
nant validity is established when the Cronbach relia-
bility coefficient of each of the scales is adequately
larger than the average of its correlations with other
constructs Ghiselli et al., 1981 . Second, statistically
distinct scales exhibit interscale correlations that are
.
adequately different from 1.0 Bagozzi et al., 1991 .
Third, if the percent variance extracted PVE by the
scale items of a construct is consistently greater than
the squared interscale correlations of the construct,

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

additional evidence for the discriminant validity of
the construct with respect to all other constructs is
established Fornell and Larcker, 1981 . Finally,
nested measurement models involving pairs of dif-
ferent constructs one with a perfect correlation and
2
one with correlation free to vary can be run and x
difference tested for significance. If the x2 differ-
ence statistic is significant for 1 df, the two con-
.
structs are statistically distinct Venkatraman, 1989 .
The discriminant validity results summarized in Table
4 confirm that they adequately pass all of the afore-
mentioned tests of discriminant validity.

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

Furthermore, we tested criterion-related validity
of the exogenous and intermediate endogenous con-
structs of the model. Criterion-related validity indi-
cates the extent to which a measurement instrument

to evaluate the model relationships for six specific
subgroups corresponding to these contingency fac-
tors: small versus large firms, recent versus experi-
enced TQM implementers, and low versus high lo-
gistical complexity. Firms were classified as small or
large using the cutoff of 250 employees Ahire and
Golhar, 1996 . TQM implementation duration of 3
years was used as the cutoff for classifying firms
based on TQM duration. Schmenner 1986 and
Funk 1995 classification was used to define firms
as low or high logistical complexity firms based on
their industry affiliation. As discussed in Section 3,
we classify SIC groups 20 through 33 as low logisti-
cal complexity industries and SIC groups 34 through
38 as high logistical complexity industries. This
classification overlaps the classification of industries
on the basis of competition Porter, 1991; Kotha and
.
Vadlamani, 1995
and dominant production pro-
cesses Swamidass and Kotha, 1998 . SIC groups 20
through 33 are characterized by relatively low com-
petition and process type production while SIC
groups 34 through 38 are high competition and
discrete production industries.

the path model and its invariance across subgroups
(cid:14)
Marsh, 1987; Bollen, 1989 . Following the recom-
mendations of Doll et al. 1998 , we examined the
adequacy of the baseline refined measurement model
for each of the subgroups as follows. The measure-
ment model was executed for each subgroup and
NNFI and CFI values were used to assess the model
fit. Table 5 summarizes the results of subgroup
analysis. It is clear that the measurement model fits
extremely well for small and large firms, more expe-
rienced firms, and firms with high logistical com-
plexity. The fit for low logistical complexity firms is
also quite adequate and comparable to the fit indices
reported by Doll et al. 1998 . Though the model fit
for recent TQM implementers is inferior to the re-
maining subgroups,
two things should be noted.
First, the lower subgroup sample size of recent TQM
implementers Ns127 firms may have partially
contributed to these low values. Second, the values
of NNFI 0.80 and CFI 0.83 still exceed the
previously reported values NNFIs0.74, CFIs
0.79 qualifying a measurement model for ‘‘cautious
interpretation’’ Doll et al., 1998 . These results
demonstrate the overall adequacy of the baseline
refined measurement model for the subgroups. All of
these results enhance the confidence in the generaliz-
ability of the measurement model for firms of differ-

.

(cid:14)

Table 6 provides further information on indirect
and total effects. Both design management and train-
ing have significant indirect and total effects on
internal quality and external quality. Process quality
management has significant direct effect on external
quality. In addition, it affects external quality signifi-
cantly through its impact on internal quality. Interest-
ingly, product design performance has a strongly
significant indirect effect on external quality through
its impact on internal quality. Thus, though there is

only weak support for the direct effect of product
design performance on external quality Hypothesis
.2 , these results show that it does have an overall
significant
impact on external quality through its
contribution to internal quality.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

Following recommendations of Anderson et al.
(cid:14)
1995 , we computed the PVE for key construct pairs
of the model. PVE for a causal relationship for
example, the direct path between training and pro-
cess quality management or the relationship between
design management and external quality through in-
termediate model linkages denotes the fraction of
the total empirical correlation between two con-
structs explained by the total effect of the affecting
construct on the affected construct Land, 1969;
Anderson et al., 1995 . Note that, with the exception
training–product design performance PVEs
of
.
40% , the model effects explained more than 50% of
correlation between key constructs. These results
indicate that the measurement of constructs and con-
ceptualization of the model relationships in the pro-
posed model is adequate. They provide further em-
pirical insights into the manner in which design and

process management strategies influence operational

6.3. Standardized effects

.
.

Table 6 also summarizes the standardized direct
and total causal effects in the model. Results point to
several interesting empirical insights regarding the
relative magnitude of influence of competing con-
structs on a particular construct. First, the impact of
design management on product design performance
(cid:14)
0.32 is more pronounced than that of training
(cid:14)
0.15 . However, training and design management
have similar impacts on process quality management
(cid:14)
0.42 and 0.43 . Second, both influence process qual-
ity management more than product design perfor-
mance. Third, design management and training have
about the same impact on internal quality 0.31 and
0.29 as on external quality 0.30 and 0.28 . Finally,
internal and external quality are affected more by
process quality management 0.63 and 0.62 than by
product design performance 0.14 and 0.13 . The
possible explanations for these results and their im-
plications for TQM theory and practice are offered in
.
the Discussion Section Section 8 .

7. Contingency analysis

(cid:14)

.

The propositions presented in Section 3 consist of
two parts. Propositions 1, 3, and 5 examine the
invariance of the levels of the constructs across the
subgroups based on firm size, TQM duration, and
logistical complexity, respectively. Propositions 2,
4, and 6 examine the invariance of the path relation-
ships across the subgroups. To test the invariance of
construct levels, we conducted a MANOVA analysis
in SPSS 7.5. The invariance of path relationships and
effects across the subgroups was tested by running
multigroup analysis in LISREL 8.2.

(cid:14)

.

7.1. MANOVA results

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

effects of firm size, TQM duration, and logistical
complexity on levels of the model constructs are
presented in Table 7. Four indices of multivariate
tests of significance are presented: Pillai’s trace,
Wilk’s lambda, Hotelling’s trace, and Roy’s largest
root Norusis, 1998 . Due to space limitations, we do
not provide the detailed results of MANOVA. The
values and significance of the indices indicated that
firm size and TQM duration have a multivariate
significant
impact on the model constructs while
logistical complexity does not. Moreover, firm size
significantly affects only the external quality out-
comes ps0.002 . TQM duration, however, has a
consistent impact on each of the model constructs.
Thus, Proposition 1 invariance of construct levels
across firm size groups is rejected but it appears that
firm size affects only external quality outcomes. On
the whole, firm size does not affect the model sub-
stantially. Proposition 3 invariance of construct lev-
els across TQM duration groups is clearly rejected.
Note that experienced TQM firms more than 3 years
.
of TQM implementation
exhibit a significantly
higher score on each construct as compared to their
less experienced counterparts 3 or fewer years of
TQM . Thus, a firm’s TQM duration does appear to
affect the intensity of implementation of the design
and process management constructs and conse-
quently the performance outcome levels. Finally,
lack of significance of the multivariate statistics for
logistical complexity industry type indicates that
Proposition 5 cannot be rejected. Thus, the levels of
design and process management constructs and their
outcomes are invariant across different industry types.

7.2. Subgroup structural model analysis

(cid:14)

To test if the model relationships vary across the
subgroups, we conducted a four-stage analysis of
path models for the various subgroups using LISREL
8.2 Joreskog and Sorbom, 1998 . The detailed re-
sults of the analyses described below are available
with the principal author for interested readers. The
(cid:14)
conclusions of the analyses in terms of testing Pro-
positions 2, 4, and 6 are summarized in Table 7.

Second, a two-group LISREL analysis was con-
ducted on the subgroup samples corresponding to
each contingency factor. Two types of path coeffi-
cient estimates were obtained for each subgroup:
unstandardized coefficient estimate Type A and
within-group completely standardized coefficient es-
timate Type B . These were reviewed for each
subgroup of the corresponding contingency model.
Type A coefficients of each subgroup can be re-
viewed to check if any subgroup deviates substan-
tially from the overall structural model in terms of
the significance of individual paths. The significance
of most of the paths was similar across the sub-
groups. The within-group completely standardized
path coefficient estimates Type B can be used to
compare the relative magnitudes of various direct
effects within each subgroup. These estimates were
obtained in LISREL 8.2 by standardizing the latent
variables within a subgroup to unit variance for each
subgroup, and are similar to standardized regression
coefficients in multiple regression. The relative mag-
nitudes of effects for various paths of the structural
model remained consistent within all groups. Finally,
the values of the standardized total effects of impor-
tant model construct relationships and squared multi-
ple correlations for each endogenous construct within
each subgroup indicated similar patterns within each
subgroup of corresponding contingencies.

Third, following the multigroup invariance assess-

Finally, using recommendations for aggregate in-
variance analysis Doll et al., 1998; Joreskog and
Sorbom, 1998 , we further tested the overall path
coefficients invariance across the sub-groups for each
contingency as follows. For each contingency, first a
fully constrained model
invariance across subgroups
imposed for each path coefficient, correlations be-
tween exogenous constructs, correlations between
endogenous constructs, and measurement errors of
constructs was executed. Next, a relaxed model
(cid:14)relaxing the invariance constraints for all path coef-
ficients was executed. The two models were com-
pared for significance of their x2 difference as well
as other indices NNFI and CFI to conclude whether
the path coefficients are significantly different across
the subgroups. The results were in exact agreement
with the single-path coefficient invariance analysis
reported above and validated the conclusion that
(cid:14)
Propositions 2, 4, and 6 cannot be rejected. In
summary, the path model relationships are empiri-
cally shown to be invariant across all of the sub-
groups.

8.1. Summary of results

(cid:14)

The measurement model turned out to be ade-
quate for the entire sample as well as for the six
subgroups based on size, TQM duration, and logisti-
cal complexity of firms Tables 3–5 . The hypothe-
sized structural path model exhibited adequate fit for
the entire sample Table 6 and in all of the sub-
groups. Moreover, both firm size and logistical com-
plexity did not have a significant impact on either
the levels of individual constructs or the strength of
their relationships Table 7 . While TQM duration
did not influence the strength of path relations, it did
affect the level of execution of design and process
management constructs and internal and external
quality outcomes. Conclusions of the hypotheses and
propositions are summarized in Table 7.

8.2. Generalizability of results

The model presented in Fig. 1 has significant
generalizability to small as well as large firms. It is
equally suitable for explaining the impact of design
and process management on quality outcomes for
any firm regardless of its TQM experience. Finally,
it is applicable to different industry contexts inde-
pendent of the level of competition, prevalent pro-
duction processes, and logistical complexity of pro-
duction. In order to further confirm whether clearer
demarcation of industries into discrete versus process
production industries affects the conclusions based
on logistical complexity, we refined the process pro-
duction and discrete production classification as fol-
lows. SIC groups 34 fabricated metal products , 35
industrial and commercial machinery, 36 electronic
and electrical machinery , 37 transportation equip-
ment , and 38 instrumentation were classified as
discrete production industries. SIC groups 20 food
and kindred , 22 textile mill products , 26 paper
and allied products , 28 chemicals and allied prod-
ucts , 29 petroleum refining , and 30 rubber were
classified as process production industries. We re-
peated the industry contingency analysis for this
dichotomy. The pattern of results was exactly identi-
cal to that reported in Table 10. These detailed and
multifaceted contingency analyses demonstrate that
the model has extremely high applicability in various
organizational and industry contexts.

8.3. Structural model relationships

With the exception of the product design perfor-
mance–external quality path, all of the hypothesized
path linkages are strongly supported. The excellent
model fit indices, high R2 values for endogenous
constructs, and the high percent variance explained
(cid:14)
PVE for key construct pairs in the model further
enhance the confidence in the structural model.

.

The standardized direct and total effects explain
the relative importance of design and process man-
agement
in various intermediate and final quality
outcomes. Vis-a-vis training, design management has
a more pronounced impact on product design perfor-
mance. However, both of these exogenous constructs
have an identical impact on process quality manage-

concurrent

ment. This finding demonstrates the higher impact of
the specialized design management practices cross-
functional organization,
engineering,
quality function deployment, and design of experi-
ments on a firm’s ability to excel along new product
development and design improvement as compared
to process quality tools training. These specialized
design management practices also complement spe-
cific quality training in its impact on process quality
management. For example, cross-functional integra-
tion of quality efforts is an enabler of teamwork,
(cid:14)
cooperation, and quality-oriented culture
Funk,
1992; Lawler et al., 1992; Mirvis, 1997; Grandzol
and Gershon, 1998 . The same employees who par-
ticipate in the advanced design management prac-
tices also execute process quality management ele-
ments. Their knowledge, experience, and attitudes
regarding teamwork, cooperation, and customer fo-
cus should spill over into the on-going efforts of
tracking and improving the quality of manufacturing
processes. Hence, both design management and qual-
ity training are important for effective process qual-
ity management.

.

Both design management and training have about
the same impact on internal quality as well as exter-
nal quality. This answers the principal research ques-
tion of the relevance of design and process manage-
ment in quality efforts. Thus, though design manage-
ment efforts tend to take place in the background
while quality training and process management activ-
ities are usually in the forefront of quality efforts, the
results demonstrate that both are critical to attaining
superior
internal and external quality. Focus on
cost-efficient production of Model T cars in the late
1920s or standardization of models and components
at the expense of consumer dissatisfaction by Ford,
GM, and Chrysler until the 1980s indicate the futility
of process quality and cost management without
regard to customer-oriented product design efforts
(cid:14)
Melnyk and Denzler, 1996 . On the other hand, as
General Electric’s rotary compressor disaster in the
1980s demonstrates, hasty introduction of ill-desig-
ned products without regard to manufacturability and
process quality costs can also lead to inordinate
internal and external quality costs Dean and Evans,
1994 . Our results validate these arguments and rein-
force the equality of importance of design and pro-
cess management in successful quality efforts.

The weak support for the product design perfor-
mance–external quality direct effect, in conjunction
with significant
indirect effect of product design
performance on external quality through internal
quality provides further insights. The cost and con-
formance quality dimensions directly affect customer
perception upon field usage. However, the customers
.
view cost in relation to product design features .
Product design performance measures of product
development speed and product simplification have a
pronounced impact on the internal quality indicators
such as
than on
customer-based views of product design changes.
Thus, a firm’s product design performance efforts
have more impact on customer perception indirectly
though better costs and lower inherent defects. Hence,
this finding again supports the aforementioned argu-
ment that superior product designs must be accompa-
nied by efficient and high quality manufacturing
processes to yield superior market performance.

and defects

rework,

scrap,

The positive impact of product design perfor-
mance on internal quality can be explained by the
ability of firms excelling along design management
to also manage process quality better. Toyota, Sony,
and Rubbermaid are excellent examples of these
abilities. Although frequent product design changes
may have some negative implications for process
quality due to shorter product life cycles, the experi-
ence, competence, and attitude of people in firms
with good design efforts helps these firms manage
process quality better. This synergy between design
and process management efforts keeps the negative
impact of higher process changes caused by rapid
new product development.

8.4. Contingency effects

The tests of contingency effects of firm size,
TQM duration, and industry characteristics on the
construct levels and relationships revealed that the
model relationships are not impacted by the three
factors. The levels of implementation of design and
process management and their outcomes are also not
affected by firm size or industry characteristics.
However, TQM duration affects the levels of all
constructs design management, training, product de-
sign performance, process quality management, in-

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

ternal quality, and external quality positively. This
observation supports the theory of organizational
.
learning Deming, 1986; Senge, 1990; Garvin, 1993 .
It appears that firms are able to develop and stabilize
a better infrastructure for training and design man-
agement as TQM implementation matures. In addi-
tion, the long-term learning from managerial tools
such as cross-functional teams and concurrent engi-
neering provides a synergistic support for more ef-
fective use of specific tools such as design of experi-
ments, SPC, and error-prevention. This synergy is
gradually enhanced over time. Hence, as TQM im-
plementation matures, the design management efforts
as well as training and process quality management
efforts are implemented more rigorously. As a conse-
quence, firms are able to produce superior design
products at lower costs and higher production qual-
ity. This ultimately results in superior external qual-
ity. These findings reflect
the need for firms to
persevere with balanced design and process manage-
ment efforts for 5 or more years to reap significant
benefits from their TQM efforts.

9. Conclusion

Through a large-scale cross-sectional study of
quality practices in major manufacturing industries,
we have demonstrated that both design and process
management efforts have an equal impact on internal
and external product quality. The detailed contin-
gency analysis shows that the proposed model of
synergies between design and process management
holds true for large and small firms, for firms with
different levels of TQM experience, and in different
industries with varying levels of competition, logisti-
cal complexity of production, or production process
characteristics. Finally, the results also suggest that
organizational learning enables mature TQM firms to
implement both design and process efforts more
rigorously and the synergies between design and
process management help these firms to attain better
quality outcomes.

These findings indicate that,

to attain superior
quality outcomes, firms need to balance their design
and process management efforts and persevere with

.

the long-term implementation of these efforts. Be-
cause the study spans all of the manufacturing sec-
tors SIC 20 through 39 , these findings have a wide
applicability. Furthermore, these two types of efforts
need not be perceived as being mutually exclusive.
There are many synergistic effects of design man-
agement and training on both product design perfor-
mance and process quality management. This insight
has direct implications for planning of the quality
efforts, staffing, recruitment, training, resource allo-
cation and prioritization of quality improvement pro-
jects. The study also illustrates the tactical and strate-
gic importance of design management
techniques
such as concurrent engineering, cross-functional
product development organization, and involvement
of suppliers and customers in product and process
design to the long-term success of quality programs.
Finally, the weak link between product design per-
formance and external quality along with the signif-
icant indirect effect of design performance on exter-
nal quality through internal quality has interesting
implications. It suggests that although design efforts
influence customer-based quality through visible
product changes, they influence the external quality
perceptions primarily through their contribution to
efficient production of high performance quality
products internal quality . However, firms need not
always strive for visible breakthrough improvements
in product features. These efforts need to be bal-
anced with on-going efficiency and production cost
improvement.

(cid:14)

.

What implications do these results have for spe-
cific quality improvement actions of firms? First,
design efforts such as concurrent engineering, quality
function deployment, and cross-functional involve-
ment have a significant direct
impact on internal
(cid:14)
product design performance product development
speed and product components and process quality
management efforts such as monitoring of scrap
rates, rework rates, defect rates, and corrective ac-
tions. Quality training items such as employee and
management training, and use of quality tools are
also useful in attaining high levels of product design
performance and process quality management ef-
forts. These measures of the exogenous constructs
ultimately affect internal quality measures such as
scrap and rework rates, defect rates, and reliability,
as well as external quality measures such as market

share, customer complaints, and warranty and litiga-
tion. Hence, the results empirically support the criti-
cal
influence of specific design management and
process quality related actions on final quality out-
comes. They should enhance practitioners’ confi-
dence in their design and process quality efforts as
enablers of final quality outcomes.
