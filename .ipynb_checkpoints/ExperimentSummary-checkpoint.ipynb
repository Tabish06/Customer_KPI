Hypothesis 2: Turnover will be higher in control human resource systems than in commitment human resource systems. THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT AND HYPOTHESES Testing the strategic human resource perspective first requires catego- rizing organizations into a meaningful typology of human resource systems. Finally, Hypothesis 3 states that the negative relationship between turn- over and manufacturing performance will be higher in commitment human resource systems than in control systems. Further, research progress on the human resource strategy perspective depends critically on the development of conceptually and methodologi- cally sound measures of the human resource system construct. In contrast, commitment human resource systems shape desired employee behaviors and attitudes by forging psychological links between organizational and employee goals. In addition, the study has shown that identification of human resource systems promises to add significantly to understanding the relationship between turnover and organizational performance.\n"

First, our model posits that entrepreneurial orientation, the intensity of government regulations, and customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues are drivers of a PES. The interaction effect of entrepreneurial orientation and customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues was not related signiﬁcantly to PES (b = -0.02; ns); therefore, Hypothesis 3 was not supported.

While the literature on the effective man-\\nagement of business and natural environment interfaces is\\nrich and growing, there are still two questions regarding\\nwhich the literature has yet to reach a definitive conclu-\\nsion: (1) what is the interactive effect between internal and\\nexternal drivers on a proactive environmental strategy\\n(PES)? and (2) does a PES influence firm’s performance?\\nDrawing on the resource-based view for the internal\\ndrivers’ perspective and institutional and legitimacy theo-\\nries for the external drivers’ perspective, this study suggests\\nthat the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on a PES is\\nmoderated by the intensity of government regulations and\\ncustomers’ sensitivity to environmental issues. The authors\\nalso examine the relationship between the PES and a firm’s\\nperformance in terms of sales and profit growth. Implica-\\ntions are discussed regarding the role of a PES in achieving\\na competitive advantage in the marketplace.\\n\\nKEY WORDS: proactive environmental strategy, entre-\\npreneurial orientation, resource-based view,\\nlegitimacy\\ntheory, institutional pressure, stakeholder theory, natural\\nenvironment\\n\\nin the antecedents of a ﬁrm’s\\nScholarly interest\\nproactive environmental strategy (hereafter PES) and\\nin its impact on performance has been strong and is\\ngrowing exponentially (e.g., Aragon-Correa and\\nSharma, 2003). This interest is not conﬁned to the\\nacademic community. A recent report by Business\\nfor Social Responsibility (2007, pp. 11–35) offers\\nseveral examples of ﬁrms engaging in PESs: (1)\\nDuPont, a $27 billion chemical company with\\noperations\\nis well regarded for\\nachieving substantial emission reductions over the\\nlast 15 years, as well as making further commitments\\n\\nin 75 countries,\\n\\nto reach 65% below the 1990-emission levels by\\n2010. The company considers\\ninternal capacity\\nbuilding important for cogenerating social beneﬁt,\\nbusiness opportunity, and growth in the context of\\nclimate change. (2) 3M uses a companywide system\\ncalled Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) that encour-\\nages employees at all levels to rethink products and\\nprocesses to eliminate waste. Over the last three\\ndecades, the program has generated gains every year.\\n(3) Bayer has an executive Corporate Sustainability\\nBoard on climate change and a working group on\\nrenewable raw materials. (4) Unilever, which ﬁnds\\nthat raw materials account for up to 10 times the\\ncompany’s internal emissions, gives preference to\\nsuppliers’ products with lower emissions.\\n\\nWe deﬁne PES as a top management-supported,\\nenvironmentally oriented strategy that focuses on the\\nprevention (versus control or the reactive using of an\\nend-of-pipe approach) of wastes, emissions, and pol-\\nlution through continuous learning,\\ntotal quality\\nenvironmental management, risk taking, and plan-\\nning (e.g., Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003; Hart,\\n1995). A PES has been predominantly viewed from an\\ninternally driven (competitive) perspective, and the\\nterm is used to describe a ﬁrm’s voluntary and inno-\\nvative activities of pollution prevention, which are\\ninitiated and championed by top management (e.g.,\\nAragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003; Sharma, 2000;\\nSharma and Vredenburg, 1998). That is, we deﬁne a\\nPES as a higher-order construct that is composed of\\ntwo sub-dimensions: pollution-prevention and top\\nmanagement support of natural environmental issues.\\nAlthough a PES has generally been approached from\\nmerely a pollution-prevention perspective, we deem\\nthat the inclusion of top management support, as a\\n\\n\\x0c280\\n\\nBulent Menguc et al.\\n\\ntop-down process, is essential because winning the\\nsupport and attention of top management is critical for\\na PES’s success. Previous researchers who have drawn\\non this perspective have advanced our understanding\\nthe effect of a PES on a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage\\n(Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). Hart (1995), how-\\never, in his original article on the natural resource-\\nbased framework, has proposed that a strict, internally\\ndriven perspective to a PES is limited. Hart (1995)\\nthat a PES should also accommodate an\\nargues\\nexternal,\\nlegitimacy-based perspective because a\\nlegitimacy-based perspective to a PES does not\\nendanger competitive advantage but, in fact, further\\nstrengthens it.\\n\\nAs a consequence, in this study, we test Hart’s\\nproposition accommodating these two comple-\\nmentary perspectives in the same research setting.\\nMore speciﬁcally, we examine the interaction effect\\nbetween the internal perspective and the external\\nperspective on a PES. For example, we respond to\\ncalls by researchers such as Oliver (1991, p. 710)\\nwho contends: ‘‘Research on the combined effects\\nof resource capital and institutional capital on ﬁrm’s\\nperformance might be one approach.’’ Based on a\\nreview of the extant literature, we argue that there is\\na need to incorporate both the internally driven and\\nexternally driven factors to capture fully the essence\\nof a PES.\\n\\nthat\\n\\nThere has been considerable research aimed at\\nunderstanding the internally driven perspective of a\\nPES by drawing on the resource-based view (RBV)\\nof the ﬁrm (e.g., Aragon-Correa, 1998; Sharma,\\n2000; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). We extend\\nthis framework by positing the externally driven\\nperspective as a moderator\\nis expected to\\ndelineate the boundary conditions of the inﬂuence\\nof the internally driven perspective. That is, rather\\nthan simply including the internal and external fac-\\ntors as direct effects on a PES, our model pursues a\\ncontingency approach that explicates the contextual\\nconditions of\\nfactor’s\\ncontribution to a PES. The externally driven per-\\nspective draws on institutional\\ntheory and the\\nlegitimacy literature by incorporating the notion of\\ncorporate social performance (e.g., Hooghiemstra,\\n2000; Wilmshurst and Frost, 2000). Both the inter-\\nnal and external perspectives, we suggest, are com-\\nplementary and capture the extent of a ﬁrm’s social\\nperformance and responsiveness. In order to realize a\\n\\nthe impact of an internal\\n\\ntrue and accurate understanding of the value-gen-\\nerating role of a PES, there is a need to include the\\ninteractive effect of the two perspectives.\\n\\nthe effect of\\n\\nthe ﬁrm, and its derivatives\\n\\nIn order to summarize, this study has the fol-\\nlowing purposes. First, we develop and test a con-\\nceptual model that investigates how the externally\\ndriven perspective, drawing on institutional and\\nlegitimacy theories, moderates\\nthe\\ninternally driven perspective, which has its roots in\\nthe RBV of\\n(e.g.,\\ndynamic capabilities, natural RBV, etc.) on a PES.\\nSecond, we examine the performance ramiﬁcations\\nof a PES in terms of the sales and proﬁt growth of a\\nﬁrm. If a PES can enhance the sales and proﬁt\\ngrowth of a ﬁrm, we deem then that this will be\\nperceived in a positive light by managers who are\\ncontemplating whether to allocate more resources\\nand budget to environmentally friendly strategies.\\nWe use data from various manufacturing ﬁrms in\\nNew Zealand, a country known for its commitment\\nto advancing an environmental agenda.\\n\\nIn the sections to follow, we revisit the existing\\nliterature on the internally driven and externally\\ndriven perspectives of a PES and integrate the two\\nstreams of research into a broader model of a PES.\\nWe then develop our model and propose our\\nhypotheses, followed by our research methods and\\ndata analysis. Finally, we discuss our study’s theo-\\nretical and managerial implications.\\n\\nLiterature review\\n\\nIn accordance with the growing scholarly interest,\\nprevious researchers have discussed at length the\\nperformance implications of a PES. The proponents\\nof a PES have, for long, provided empirical evidence\\nthat a PES is indeed positively related to a ﬁrm’s\\nefﬁciency and effectiveness (Russo and Fouts, 1997).\\nThere is also, however, equally convincing empirical\\nevidence showing that a PES has no signiﬁcant\\nperformance impact\\n(Christmann, 2000). In her\\nstudy, Christmann (2000) discussed some of\\nthe\\nnoticeable methodological problems that may have\\ncontributed to the inconsistent ﬁndings in the cur-\\nrent literature. While this scholarly debate continues,\\nit is clear that there is a lack of agreement about what\\nthe antecedents to a PES are and how they are\\ncombined to inﬂuence a PES. A careful review,\\n\\n\\x0cInteractive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES\\n\\n281\\n\\nhowever, of Hart’s (1995) original proposition re-\\nveals that two complementary perspectives of a PES\\nexist: (1) an internally driven (or competitive) per-\\nspective (Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003) and (2)\\nan externally driven (or legitimacy-based) perspec-\\ntive (Oliver, 1991). We now revisit the existing\\nliterature on each perspective,\\nrespectively, and\\nsubsequently integrate the two by positing an\\ninteraction between the two perspectives.\\n\\nInternally driven perspective on a proactive environmental\\nstrategy\\n\\nSharma (2000, p. 683) deﬁnes a PES as ‘‘a consistent\\npattern of company actions taken to reduce the\\nenvironmental impact of operations, not to fulﬁll\\nenvironmental regulations or to conform to standard\\npractices.’’ In addition, we add top management\\nsupport to such a strategy as an important dimension\\nof a PES because we see this strategy as a process that is\\ntop-down in nature. Thus, we deﬁne a PES as a\\nhigher-order construct that consists of two ﬁrst-order\\ndimensions: pollution-prevention and top manage-\\nment support of natural environmental issues. Next,\\nwe explain the two sub-dimensions in greater detail.\\nFrom a pollution-prevention perspective, a pro-\\nactive (or innovative) environmental strategy is a\\nreﬂection of evolutionary environmental\\nstrategy\\nmodels that have gone beyond the early compli-\\nance versus noncompliance categorizations. Previous\\nresearchers have approached PES from a pollution-\\nprevention versus pollution-control perspective (e.g.,\\nHart, 1995; Hart and Ahuja, 1996; Russo and Fouts,\\n1997), while others have taken a proactive versus\\nreactive perspective (e.g., Aragon-Correa, 1998;\\nSharma, 2000; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998).\\nNevertheless, both approaches have highlighted the\\nsame phenomenon. That is, while a PES represents a\\nproactive (or voluntary and innovative) approach,\\npollution-control\\nreactive\\n(or conformance/compliance) approach. A PES aims\\nto minimize emissions, efﬂuents, and wastes. Central\\nto a PES are continuous improvement methods that\\nfocus on well-deﬁned environmental objectives rather\\nthan relying on expensive ‘‘end-pipe’’ capital invest-\\nments to control emissions. As Hart (1995) has dem-\\nonstrated, a PES provides a ﬁrm with a competitive\\n\\nrepresent\\n\\nstrategies\\n\\na\\n\\nadvantage through lower costs, shorter cycle times, and\\na better utilization of resources and capabilities.\\n\\nFrom a top management supportive perspective,\\nwe posit that a ﬁrm’s adoption of a PES reﬂects\\ntop management’s commitment to natural environ-\\nmental issues. Key behaviors on the part of the top\\nmanagers include, but are not limited to: commu-\\nnicating and addressing critical environmental issues;\\ninitiating environmental programs\\nand policies;\\nrewarding employees for environmental improve-\\nments; and contributing organizational resources to\\nenvironmental\\n(Berry and Rondinelli,\\n1998).\\n\\ninitiatives\\n\\nstrong network ties\\n\\nIn general, top managers’ strategic leadership and\\ntheir support may play a critical role in shaping an\\norganization’s values and orientation toward natural\\nenvironmental issues (Berry and Rondinelli, 1998).\\nThe building of\\ninside and\\noutside the industry, and acquisition of more\\nknowledge about environmental activities may in-\\ncrease top managers’ sensitivity to environmental\\nconcerns and enable them to benchmark their ﬁrm’s\\nenvironmental activities with those of competitors in\\nthe marketplace (Menon and Menon, 1997). In\\naddition, previous researchers acknowledge the role\\nof top management as signiﬁcant in predicting cor-\\nporate social performance (Miles, 1987; Weaver\\net al., 1999). In ﬁrms that are described as ‘‘com-\\nmercial and environmentally excellent,’’ support and\\ninvolvement\\nfrom top management on environ-\\nmental issues are common (Henriques and Sadorsky,\\n1999; Hunt and Auster, 1990; Roome, 1992).\\nBanerjee (1992) argues that the commitment of top\\nmanagement is crucial to successful environmental\\nmanagement. In addition, Coddington (1993) and\\nHart\\n(1995) conclude that corporate vision and\\nstrong leadership are the two key facilitators of the\\nimplementation of a corporatewide, environmental\\nmanagement strategy. To this end, Dechant and\\nAltman (1994, p. 9) note that\\n‘‘environmental\\nleaders inspire a shared value of the organization as\\nenvironmentally sustainable, creating or maintaining\\ngreen values throughout the enterprise.’’ A good\\nexample of top management leadership and proac-\\ntive involvement on environmental\\nissues is the\\nenvironmental position taken by The Body Shop\\nand its founder Anita Roddick.\\n\\nSince Hart’s article ﬁrst appeared in AMR,\\nscholars have spent signiﬁcant time and effort trying\\n\\n\\x0c282\\n\\nBulent Menguc et al.\\n\\nto understand the fundamental propositions of the\\nnatural resource-based view (NRBV). Similarly, the\\ninternally driven (or competitive) perspective has\\nreceived considerable attention. More recently, this\\nperspective has been located within the ‘‘dynamic\\ncapabilities’’ approach (Aragon-Correa and Sharma,\\n2003). Eisenhardt and Martin (2000, p. 1107) deﬁne\\ndynamic capabilities as ‘‘the ﬁrm’s processes that use\\nresources – especially the processes to integrate,\\nreconﬁgure, gain and release resources – to match and\\neven create market change. Dynamic capabilities,\\nthus, are the organizational and strategic routines by\\nwhich ﬁrms achieve new resource conﬁgurations as\\nmarkets emerge, collide, split, evolve, and die.’’\\n\\nAccording to proponents of this perspective (e.g.,\\nAragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003), a PES, from a\\npollution-prevention and top management support-\\nive perspective, is consistent with the very deﬁnition\\nof dynamic capabilities for several reasons. First, a PES\\nshares a fundamental proposition with the NRBV in\\nthat ‘‘to the extent [that] these practices are tacit,\\ncasually ambiguous, ﬁrm speciﬁc, socially complex,\\npath dependent, and value adding for consumers, they\\nmay provide advantage’’ (Aragon-Correa and Shar-\\nma, 2003, p. 74). In fact, the adoption of a PES results\\nin a substantial competitive advantage due to (pro-\\ncess-driven) cost advantages\\n(Aragon-Correa and\\nSharma, 2003; Hart, 1995; Hart and Ahuja, 1996;\\nKlassen and Whybark, 1999; Majumdar and Marcus,\\n2001) and (product-driven) differentiation advantages\\n(Hart, 1995). A long-term, sustainable advantage lies\\nin the resource conﬁgurations that managers build\\nusing a PES (Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003;\\nChristmann, 2000).\\n\\nSecond, a PES is idiosyncratic (i.e., organization\\nspeciﬁc) due to its social complexity (Aragon-Correa\\nand Sharma, 2003). For example, Majumdar and\\nMarcus (2001) showed that when managers create a\\nbalance between regulatory policies and their dis-\\ncretion, they can enjoy entrepreneurship, creativity,\\nand risk taking; conduct R&D; and even develop\\nnew technologies, which are all important resources\\nfor a PES. Sharma (2000) found that the managerial\\ninterpretation of\\nthe environment either as an\\nopportunity or a threat inﬂuences the extent to\\nwhich a PES is deployed. To this end, Marcus and\\nGeffen (1998, p. 1147) came to the conclusion that\\n‘‘key players are likely to interpret the conditions\\nthey face and assign meaning to the actions they take\\n\\nin fairly idiosyncratic ways.’’ Therefore, depending\\non the dominant coalition’s attitude and commitment\\nto natural environmental issues, the adoption and\\nimplementation of a PES can be viewed as an\\nopportunity to generate growth or as a threat and\\ndisruption to existing operations. Andersson and\\nBateman’s (2000) study shows that the success of\\nemployee-championing behaviors regarding natural\\nenvironmental issues depends on their alignment with\\ntop management’s positive attention and actions to-\\nward these issues. Thus, we view top management’s\\nsupport of natural environmental issues to be idio-\\nsyncratic and organization speciﬁc because manage-\\nrial vision, leadership, and focus are distinctive and\\nsocially complex.\\n\\nstakeholder perspectives\\n\\nThird, a dynamic capability approach to a PES\\nentails a complex integration and reconﬁguration of\\norganizational, managerial, higher-order learning,\\nand divergent\\n(Aragon-\\nCorrea and Sharma, 2003). To this end, a PES is\\nconsistent with the dynamic capability perspective in\\nthat a PES involves an intricate integration of pollu-\\ntion prevention, and managerial support and leader-\\nship. Sharma and Vredenburg (1998) have shown that\\ncompetitively valuable organizational capabilities\\nsuch as stakeholder integration, continuous innova-\\ntion, and higher-order learning may emerge from the\\nadoption of a PES.\\n\\nIt necessitates\\n\\nFourth, the application of a PES involves path\\ndependency.\\nthe integration and\\ncombination of tacit capabilities that lead to causal\\nambiguity and barriers to imitation. The effective\\nformulation and execution of a PES demands the\\nalignment of the appropriate control mechanisms\\nwith incentives eliciting organizational structures so\\nthat all employees are motivated to participate actively\\nin the delivery of the strategy (Aragon-Correa and\\nSharma, 2003).\\n\\nExternally driven perspective on a proactive environmental\\nstrategy\\n\\nIn addition to the internally driven perspective, a\\nPES needs\\nto take into consideration externally\\ndriven (or legitimacy-based) activities under insti-\\ntutional pressure because a purely internally driven\\napproach may prove inadequate due to issues of\\nexternal (social) legitimacy and reputation (Hart,\\n\\n\\x0cInteractive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES\\n\\n283\\n\\nregulation and consumer\\n\\n1995). Suchman (1995, p. 574) deﬁnes legitimacy as\\n‘‘a generalized perception or assumption that the\\nactions of an entity are desirable.’’ Rao et al. (2008)\\nargue that in emerging industries, new ventures face\\nthe vexing ‘‘liability of newness’’ problem because\\nthey have to prove to stakeholders that they are\\nworthy investment opportunities. We contend that\\nwhen there are institutional pressures such as gov-\\nernment\\nsensitivity to\\nenvironmental issues, a ﬁrm’s desire to enhance social\\nﬁtness is likely to provide the boundary condition for\\nthe effectiveness of economic ﬁtness. That is, insti-\\ntutional theory suggests that when there is institu-\\ntional pressure from various stakeholders, improving\\nsocial legitimacy in the eyes of its stakeholders can\\nmoderate the degree to which ﬁrms adopt a PES based\\non internal antecedents (e.g., Oliver, 1991). In fact,\\nOliver (1991, p. 150) posits that responding to insti-\\ntutional pressure ‘‘emphasizes\\nthe importance of\\nobtaining legitimacy for purposes of demonstrating\\nsocial worthiness.’’\\n\\nA legitimacy-based view has its roots in neo-\\ninstitutional\\ntheory (e.g., DiMaggio and Powell,\\n1983; Oliver, 1991). Legitimacy theory is widely used\\nas a framework to explain strategic choice with regard\\nto the environmental and social behavior of organi-\\nzations (Harvey and Schaefer, 2001; Hooghiemstra,\\n2000). Neo-institutional theorists (e.g., DiMaggio\\nand Powell, 1983; Oliver, 1991) posit that since a\\ncompetitive strategy may foster cooperative action in\\nthe interest of\\nlegitimacy, a competitive\\nadvantage must be created within the broader scope\\nof social legitimacy. From a legitimacy theory per-\\nspective, attention to the public’s perception of the\\nﬁrm and the reputation of the company will alter the\\ninternal perspective’s impact on a PES (Hooghiem-\\nstra, 2000). As we outline subsequently, our predic-\\ntion is that when there is greater social pressure from\\nstakeholders such as the government and consumers,\\nthe inﬂuence of the internal perspective on a PES will\\nbe strengthened.\\n\\nsocial\\n\\nBecause of the tacit nature of a pollution-pre-\\n(legitimacy-based)\\nvention capability, an external\\norientation should not\\ncompetitive\\nadvantage, but rather reinforce and differentiate the\\nﬁrm’s position through the positive effect of a good\\nreputation (Hart, 1995). Hence, a ﬁrm must also\\nmaintain legitimacy and build reputation through\\ncommunication and transparency to invite external\\n\\njeopardize\\n\\nstakeholders’ scrutiny into their operations (Hart,\\n1995; Suchman, 1995).\\n\\nInteraction between the two perspectives\\n\\nBased on the preceding literature review, we suggest\\nthat a model attempting to explain a PES should take\\na contingency view and capture how the externally\\ndriven perspective moderates the internally driven\\nperspective’s effect on a PES. We outline the reasons\\nfor our approach below.\\n\\nFirst, while each perspective emphasizes a different\\naspect of a ﬁrm’s management of the business–natural\\nenvironment interface, both aim to enhance the\\nﬁrm’s competitive advantage in the natural environ-\\nmental arena. While one underscores the economic\\nﬁtness approach, the other emphasizes the social\\nﬁtness approach. As a consequence, the interplay\\nbetween these two approaches can shed light on how\\na PES can be developed. Second, both perspectives\\nare theory driven and have received attention from\\nscholars in their respective ﬁelds of research. It is also\\nimportant to note that both perspectives are designed\\nto promote a better understanding of the inﬂuence of\\na PES on a ﬁrm’s performance. Indeed, they are not\\nmutually exclusive paths for ﬁrms to follow.\\n\\nIn summary, our review of the literature suggests\\nthat there is a shortage of studies that simultaneously\\nmodel both the internal and external perspectives\\nrelating to a PES, and moreover, their interactive ef-\\nfects. The lack of such a contingency approach in\\nmodeling a PES leads to at least two major problems\\nthat are of concern: First, most studies have subscribed\\nto only one perspective of a PES and have used the\\nsame term to refer to different aspects of a ﬁrm’s\\nbehavior; this has produced results that are often dif-\\nﬁcult to compare and sometimes contradictory. Sec-\\nond, the richness of a PES is not exploited. Adopting\\nonly one perspective implies that the full range of\\noptions for a ﬁrm seeking to improve its performance\\nmay not be captured; this can lead to a partial expla-\\nnation of a ﬁrm’s performance and to an incomplete\\ntheory. Third, reliance on a direct effects only model\\ncan obstruct the insights that a contingency model, by\\noffering the boundary conditions of the impact of\\ninternally driven factors on a PES, can provide.\\n\\nIn light of the limitations associated with the\\nextant literature, it is important to develop a model\\n\\n\\x0c284\\n\\nBulent Menguc et al.\\n\\nexternal environment. More speciﬁcally, we consider\\ninstitutional pressures from important stakeholders,\\nsuch as consumers and government, which may\\npossess valuable tangible and intangible resources.\\n\\nThe effect of entrepreneurial orientation on proactive\\nenvironmental strategy\\n\\nFirms are not likely to pursue a PES unless their upper\\nechelons emphasize entrepreneurial activity (i.e.,\\ninnovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking)\\n(Covin\\nand Slevin, 1989, 1991). Top management’s recep-\\ntivity regarding pollution prevention will increase\\nwhen ﬁrms possess more of an entrepreneurial\\norientation. Aragon-Correa and Sharma (2003, p. 74)\\nclaim that ‘‘[p]roactive strategies such as pollution-\\nprevention approaches need to be integrated into the\\nadministrative, entrepreneurial,\\nand engineering\\ndimensions of a ﬁrm.’’ Indeed ‘‘enviropreneurial\\nmarketing,’’ a term coined by Varadarajan (1992) that\\nunderscores\\nincorporating an\\nentrepreneurial spirit into the pursuit of an environ-\\nmental marketing strategy, is consistent with a PES\\nthat promotes ecological sustainability (Menon and\\nMenon, 1997).\\n\\nthe importance of\\n\\nWhen there\\n\\nan entrepreneurial mindset\\nembedded in the organization, top management is\\nmore willing to take risks, tolerate ambiguity and\\n\\nis\\n\\nthat can incorporate both perspectives, and more\\nimportantly, demonstrate the interactive effect of the\\ntwo on a PES. It is also essential to substantiate\\nempirically the effect of a PES on ﬁrm’s perfor-\\nmance. Our model, which we explain next, satisﬁes\\nthese requirements.\\n\\nProposed model and hypotheses\\n\\nThe theories that we draw onto construe our model,\\nwhich is depicted in Figure 1, are the RBV of the\\nﬁrm and its derivatives (internal perspective), and\\ninstitutional and legitimacy theories (external per-\\nspective). The central tenet of the RBV of the ﬁrm\\nand its derivations (i.e., NRBV and dynamic capa-\\nbilities perspective) suggest that a ﬁrm’s PES and, in\\nturn, the ﬁrm’s growth and competitive advantage is\\ndetermined by its idiosyncratic internal resources and\\ncapabilities\\n(e.g., Barney, 1991; Eisenhardt and\\nMartin, 2000; Hart, 1995; Teece et al., 1997;\\nWernerfelt, 1984).\\nIn our model, we examine\\nentrepreneurial orientation as an idiosyncratic capa-\\nbility that is likely to explain the extent to which a\\nﬁrm adopts a PES.\\n\\nLegitimacy and institutional theories are useful in\\nthe development of our hypotheses because both are\\ndiagnostic with regard to how ﬁrms respond with\\nstrategic choices based on the demands of the macro\\n\\nExternal Perspective \\n\\nGovernment regulations \\nCustomer environmental \\nsensitivity \\n\\nInternal Perspective \\n\\nEntrepreneurial orientation \\n\\nProactive Environmental \\n\\nStrategy \\n\\nFirm Performance \\n\\nCovariates\\n\\nFirm size \\nType of industry \\nEnvironmental \\ndynamism \\n\\nFigure 1.

Managers are more\\ninclined to interpret new market spaces as oppor-\\ntunities than threats (Dutton and Jackson, 1987;\\nSharma, 2000). In fact, drawing on the strategic issue\\ninterpretation literature, Sharma (2000) reports that\\nthe more managers interpret environmental issues as\\nopportunities rather than threats, the more likely\\nthey are to adopt a PES. Such bold, aggressive, and\\nproactive attitudes are likely to transfer into the\\nadoption and implementation of more innovative\\nand creative products and processes that are unique\\nand difﬁcult to imitate (Russo and Fouts, 1997).\\nMoreover, when there is a high entrepreneur-\\nial orientation, organizational capabilities, such as\\nlearning, continuous innovation, and experimenta-\\ntion, are present, which lay the foundation for the\\nadoption of a PES. Consistent with our argument,\\nAragon-Correa (1998) found that prospector-type\\nﬁrms that invest highly in entrepreneurship, engi-\\nneering, and administration are more likely to adopt\\na PES.\\n\\nA PES entails considerable risk and uncertainty,\\nand requires an innovative posture for it to be ﬁrmly\\nestablished in an organization (Aragon-Correa, 1998;\\nAragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003). The proclivity of\\ntop management to support natural environmental\\nissues is enhanced when an entrepreneurial orienta-\\ntion is pervasive in the organization. As a conse-\\nquence, an entrepreneurial orientation with its focus\\non seeking new ventures, growth, and market\\nopportunities is consistent with the development of a\\nPES. As a result, a ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial orientation is\\nlikely to promote a PES. Thus, we hypothesize the\\nfollowing:\\n\\nH1: A ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial orientation is related\\nenvironmental\\n\\nproactive\\n\\npositively\\nstrategy.\\n\\nto a\\n\\nModerating role of intensity of government regulation\\n\\nInstitutional pressures are deﬁned as social, legal, and\\ncultural forces outside the ﬁrm that exert inﬂuence\\non how managers perceive the environment and\\neventually shape and determine strategic decisions\\nand behaviors (e.g., DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). In\\na natural environmental setting, many external forces\\n\\nmay strengthen a ﬁrm’s desire to adopt a PES based\\non the ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial orientation (Bansal and\\nRoth, 2000). We consider two components of\\ninstitutional pressure: the intensity of government\\nregulation and consumer\\nsensitivity to environ-\\nmental issues (e.g., Kassinis and Vafeas, 2006). The\\nintensity of government regulation and consumer\\nsensitivity to environmental\\nissues may further\\nmotivate ﬁrms to take proactive steps toward the\\nadoption of a PES from entrepreneurial orientation.\\nAccording to stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984),\\nthe strategic choices adopted by ﬁrms depend on\\ninstitutional pressures and the inﬂuence of impor-\\ntant stakeholders (Oliver, 1991). More speciﬁcally,\\nMitchell et al. (1997) showed that stakeholder power,\\nlegitimacy, and urgency affect a manager’s attitude\\ntoward stakeholder pressures and requests. This was\\nconﬁrmed by Henriques and Sadorsky (1999) who\\nafﬁrmed that managers in environmentally proactive\\nﬁrms were more committed to a proactive environ-\\nmental posture than those in environmentally reactive\\nﬁrms.\\n\\nNeo-institutional\\n\\ntheorists have proposed that\\nﬁrms, through proactive moves, may meet their\\nstakeholders’ expectations and enhance legitimacy,\\nthereby obtaining access\\nto the scarce resources\\nneeded to survive and succeed (DiMaggio and\\nPowell, 1983). For example, Majumdar and Marcus\\n(2001) showed that when managers achieve a bal-\\nance between their discretion and governmental\\nregulatory policies, they may enjoy entrepreneur-\\nship, be creative, conduct R & D, and even develop\\nnew technologies, all of which are important\\nresources for the development of a PES.\\n\\nOur argument is also consistent with legitimacy\\ntheory because a central tenet of this theory is a social\\ncontract that implies that a company’s survival is\\ndependent on the extent to which the company\\noperates within the bounds and norms of the macro\\nenvironment,\\nincluding society, and is viewed as\\nconstructive and performing desirable actions (Brown\\nand Deegan, 1998, p. 22). As a consequence, a\\ncompany needs to demonstrate that its actions are\\nlegitimate and its behaviors resemble good corporate\\ncitizenship (e.g., Berman et al., 1999; Miles and\\nCovin, 2000).\\n\\nTaking the above into account, we posit that\\nthere is a need to examine the interaction between\\nthe RBV perspective and institutional (legitimacy)\\n\\n\\x0c286\\n\\nBulent Menguc et al.\\n\\ntheory. According to our conceptual\\nframework,\\nthis would involve examining how institutional\\npressures such as intensity of government regulations\\nmoderate the inﬂuence of entrepreneurial orienta-\\ntion on a PES. More speciﬁcally, we argue that the\\ninteraction effect between entrepreneurial orienta-\\ntion and intensity of government regulation on a\\nPES will be positive. This is because ﬁrms operate in\\na macro environment where governments control,\\nsanction, and withhold important resources that are\\nlikely to inﬂuence a ﬁrm’s adoption of a PES. When\\nﬁrms compete in a market where government\\nregarding\\ninvolvement,\\nenvironmental\\nthere is an\\nelevated expectation for top management to comply,\\nas this is the norm, with government demands. As a\\nconsequence, in such a context, the implementation\\nof an entrepreneurial orientation will be related\\npositively to the adoption of a pollution-prevention\\nstrategy by top management. Thus, we offer the\\nfollowing interaction hypothesis.\\n\\ninterest, and regulations\\nissues are heightened,\\n\\nH2: The interaction effect between entrepreneurial\\norientation and intensity of government reg-\\nulations will be related positively to a PES.\\n\\nModerating role of consumer sensitivity to natural\\nenvironmental issues\\n\\nNext, we turn our attention to the moderating role\\nof consumer sensitivity to natural environmental is-\\nsues. When consumers are sensitive to and involved\\nwith natural environmental issues, they favor and\\nreact positively to ﬁrms that attempt to develop and\\ninitiate innovative and proactive methods that pre-\\nserve the natural environment (e.g., Garrett, 1987;\\nSchwepker and Cornwell, 1991). As consumer\\nsensitivity to natural environmental issues increase,\\nconsumers come to expect ﬁrms to develop inno-\\nvative ways to interact with the natural environ-\\nment. As a consequence, in such a context, as ﬁrms\\nengage in entrepreneurial activities, ﬁrms will realize\\nmore PES. When consumers exert pressure, ﬁrms\\nare more prone to adopt a PES for a given level of\\nentrepreneurial orientation because the adoption of a\\nPES is consistent with the voice of consumers\\n(Ogden and Watson, 1999). We posit that when\\n\\nthere is ﬁt between entrepreneurial orientation and\\nconsumer sensitivity to natural environmental issues,\\nit is likely that a ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial orientation\\nwill be related positively to a PES. Therefore, we\\nhypothesize that:\\n\\nH3: The interaction effect between entrepreneurial\\norientation and customers’ sensitivity to envi-\\nronmental issues will be related positively to a\\nPES.\\n\\nProactive environmental strategy and ﬁrm’s\\nperformance\\n\\nFirms that implement a PES will be more innovative,\\nentrepreneurially oriented, technologically sophis-\\nticated, and socially conscious, which makes such\\norganizations distinct in the eyes of customers (Porter\\nand van der Linde, 1995). Accordingly, these orga-\\nnizations will be able to preempt the market from\\ntheir competitors and enjoy a ﬁrst mover advantage\\nstatus by sending a strong signal about their com-\\nmitment to the natural environment. Because such\\nﬁrms invest in pollution prevention as opposed to\\ncontrol programs, they will engage in continuous\\ntotal quality environment management programs that\\nenable them to be more cost efﬁcient by minimizing\\nthe need to invest in expensive end-of-pipe capital\\nintensive investments (Hart, 1995; Hart and Ahuja,\\n1996). In addition, because the implementation of a\\nPES improves the image, reputation, and eventually\\nthe legitimacy of a ﬁrm, it will increase the positive\\nview of the ﬁrm as a good corporate citizen (Menon\\nand Menon, 1997). We contend that by imple-\\nmenting a PES, corporate citizenship will be en-\\nhanced, which will\\nlead to a stronger corporate\\nreputation (Berman et al., 1999). In fact, Rondinelli\\nand Berry (2000) argue that corporate environmental\\ncitizenship is critical for sustainable development.\\n\\nAs a consequence, ﬁrms that pursue a PES will be\\nperceived as differentiated in the eyes of customers.\\nThrough differentiation, ﬁrms with a PES will be able\\nto create more opportunities, and hence generate\\ngreater business growth. A PES can be used to reig-\\nnite, spark. or fuel ﬁrms into a new market space, thus\\nproviding the catalyst for sales and proﬁt growth.\\nOwing to a growing environmental consciousness\\n\\n\\x0cInteractive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES\\n\\n287\\n\\nstakeholders\\n\\nfrom various\\n\\nsuch as\\nand demands\\ncustomers,\\ninterest groups, government, and the\\nmedia, a PES can be expected to contribute to sales\\ngrowth and proﬁt growth. Increased sales growth will\\nbe realized as environmentally friendly products are\\nwell received. That is,\\nimplementing a PES will\\ngenerate additional sales in areas that are untapped and\\nwhere competition is scarce. Further, a PES will\\nmotivate ﬁrms to produce high margin products\\nadopting cutting-edge technology which can en-\\nhance proﬁt growth. Through a PES, ﬁrms can realize\\nimproved streams of cash ﬂow as a PES will be able to\\nfunction in a rent-generating role. Thus, we offer the\\nfollowing hypothesis regarding the performance im-\\npact of a PES:\\n\\nH4: A proactive environmental strategy will be\\npositively related to (a) sales growth and (b)\\nproﬁt growth.\\n\\nFinally, we do not hypothesize a direct effect on a\\nPES from the external perspective (i.e., intensity of\\ngovernment regulation and consumer sensitivity to\\nnatural environmental issues) because according to\\nour conceptual model, the external perspective is a\\nmoderator that either strengthens or weakens the\\neffect of entrepreneurial orientation on a PES.\\nHowever, as we shall show subsequently, we include\\nthe external perspective on a PES for model speci-\\nﬁcation purposes and report its effect.\\n\\nResearch method\\n\\nQuestionnaire development and measures\\n\\n(i.e.,\\n\\nresource-based) and external\\n\\nAs stated earlier, previous studies have employed the\\ninternal\\n(i.e.,\\nlegitimacy-based) perspectives to explain the extent\\nof a ﬁrm’s implementation of PES. However, there\\nis a lack of systematic research that investigates the\\ninteractive effect of the two perspectives. In order to\\nﬁll this gap in the literature, we decided to devise a\\nsurvey instrument that would enable us to test the\\nconceptual model developed in this study. More\\nspeciﬁcally, this survey instrument was meant to test\\nhow customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues\\nand the intensity of government regulations mod-\\nerate the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on a\\n\\nPES. The survey instrument also helped us measure\\nthe performance outcomes of a PES in terms of sales\\nand proﬁt growths.\\n\\nThe survey instrument was developed as follows:\\nFirst, we contacted a random selection of 15 CEOs\\nand/or key managers. We mailed a draft form of the\\nsurvey questionnaire and asked them to identify the\\nscale items they considered awkward and/or not\\napplicable. They evaluated every scale item in terms\\nof content and meaningfulness. Although we did not\\nneed to add new items, we modiﬁed some scale\\nitems based on the feedback we received. Second,\\nwe contacted four academics for their comments on\\nthe utility of the scale items. We made some revi-\\nsions to the questionnaire as a result of their evalu-\\nations. It should be noted that the questionnaire was\\ndesigned so that respondents were asked to recall\\ntheir ﬁrms’ environmental processes and efforts in\\ngeneral. In doing so, we aimed to maximize po-\\ntential variance and avoid perceptual biases (Table I).\\nUnless otherwise mentioned, all scales were mea-\\nsured with a ﬁve-point Likert scale (1 – strongly\\ndisagree, 5 – strongly agree).\\n\\nIn line with our conceptualization, we measured\\nproactive environmental strategy as a higher-order con-\\nstruct of two-ﬁrst-order dimensions: pollution pre-\\nvention and top management support. In order to\\nmeasure the scope of pollution prevention, we utilized\\nthe CERES Principles to develop a 10-item, ﬁve-\\npoint scale (1 – strongly disagree, 5 – strongly agree)\\nspeciﬁcally for this study. The CERES Principles\\n(formerly known as the Valdez Principles) are a set of\\n10 environmental management principles developed\\nin 1989 by a coalition of pension funds, environ-\\nmental groups, and religious organizations (Codd-\\nington, 1993). Previous studies have employed the\\nsame or similar items to measure the scope of a PES\\n(e.g., Sharma, 2000). Top management support mea-\\nsured the extent to which top management was seen\\nto play a critical role in shaping an organization’s\\nvalues and orientation toward a PES. We developed a\\nfour-item, ﬁve-point scale for this study (1 – strongly\\ndisagree, 5 – strongly agree).\\n\\nEntrepreneurial orientation measured the extent to\\nwhich the organization’s overall culture demon-\\nstrated a propensity to take calculated risks, to act in\\nan innovative fashion, and to be proactive on natural\\nenvironmental\\nissues. Hence, we used an eight-\\nitem, ﬁve-point scale (1 – does not describe this\\n\\n\\x0c288\\n\\nBulent Menguc et al.\\n\\nTABLE I\\n\\nConﬁrmatory factor analysis\\n\\nScales and items\\n\\nFactor loading\\n\\nt-Value\\n\\nPollution prevention (a = 0.86; CR = 0.88; AVE = 0.50)\\n\\nThis organization …\\nEliminates the release of any substance that may cause environmental damage\\nSafeguards all natural habitats affected by the operations\\nSustainably uses renewable natural resources\\nConserves non-renewable natural resources (e.g. oil, natural gas)\\nEliminates physical waste from the operations\\nReduces physical waste through recycling\\nDisposes of physical waste through environmentally safe methods\\nEliminates the use of products that cause environmental damage\\nInforms our customers of the environmental impacts of the products marketed\\nCorrects conditions that endanger the environment\\n\\nTop management support (a = 0.78; CR = 0.80; AVE = 0.55)\\n\\nTop managers in this organization…\\nCommunicate that addressing environmental issues is critical\\nInitiate environmental programs and policies\\nReward employees for environmental improvements\\nContribute organizational resources to environmental initiatives\\nEntrepreneurial orientation (a = 0.87; CR = 0.89; AVE = 0.53)\\n\\nThis organization…\\nHas a cultural emphasis on innovation and R&D\\nHas a high rate of new product introductions\\nHas a bold, innovative product development approach\\nHas a proactive posture to the market\\nHas an aggressive posture toward competitors\\nHas a strong inclination for high risk, high potential return projects\\nHas a market environment that encourages boldness to achieve objectives\\nIs ﬁrst to introduce new technologies and products\\nWhen faced with risk, adopts an aggressive, bold posture\\n\\nCustomers’ environmental sensitivity (a = 0.90; CR = 0.92; AVE = 0.65)\\n\\nThe release of substances into the environment\\nThe protection of natural habitats\\nThe sustainable use of renewable natural resources\\nThe conservation of nonrenewable natural resources\\nThe elimination of physical waste\\nThe reduction of physical waste\\nThe environmentally safe disposal of physical waste\\nPurchasing environmentally safe products\\nUnderstanding the environmental impacts of the products they use or purchase\\n\\nGovernment regulations (a = 0.86; CR = 0.88; AVE = 0.54)\\n\\nThe release of substances into the environment\\nThe protection of natural habitats\\nThe use of renewable natural resources\\nThe use of nonrenewable natural resources\\nThe elimination of physical waste\\nThe environmentally safe disposal of physical waste\\n\\n0.990a\\n0.719\\n0.677\\n0.704\\n0.584\\n0.549\\n0.750\\n0.617\\n0.772\\n0.736\\n\\n0.861a\\n0.793\\n0.424\\n0.813\\n\\n0.782a\\n0.866\\n0.917\\n0.681\\n0.720\\n0.559\\n0.691\\n0.706\\n0.502\\n\\n0.817a\\n0.819\\n0.800\\n0.836\\n0.831\\n0.840\\n0.817\\n0.670\\n0.784\\n\\n0.724a\\n0.710\\n0.726\\n0.884\\n0.807\\n0.549\\n\\n–\\n5.785\\n5.300\\n5.327\\n5.027\\n4.815\\n5.731\\n5.232\\n6.372\\n5.612\\n\\n–\\n\\n10.728\\n5.025\\n11.023\\n\\n–\\n\\n11.896\\n12.717\\n8.713\\n5.070\\n6.923\\n8.845\\n9.103\\n6.130\\n\\n–\\n\\n11.937\\n11.362\\n12.125\\n11.807\\n12.053\\n11.817\\n8.965\\n11.105\\n\\n–\\n8.045\\n8.258\\n10.336\\n9.431\\n6.007\\n\\n\\x0cInteractive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES\\n\\n289\\n\\nTABLE I\\n\\ncontinued\\n\\nScales and items\\n\\nFactor loading\\n\\nThe disclosure of environmental information\\nThe clean up of environmental accidents\\n\\nEnvironmental dynamism (a = 0.79; CR = 0.81; AVE = 0.56)\\n\\nThe operating market environment for my organization…\\nHas trends that are easy/difﬁcult to monitor\\nHas stable/volatile industry volume\\nHas sales forecasts that are quite accurate/inaccurate\\nIs predictable/unpredictable\\n\\n0.683\\n0.748\\n\\n0.909a\\n0.750\\n0.699\\n0.610\\n\\na Cronbach’s alpha, CR composite reliability, AVE average variance extracted.\\naScale item was ﬁxed to 1 to set the scale.\\n\\nt-Value\\n\\n7.805\\n8.542\\n\\n–\\n\\n10.153\\n8.894\\n7.718\\n\\norganization, 5 – deﬁnitely describes this organiza-\\ntion) adapted from Covin and Slevin (1989) for the\\nspeciﬁc context of this study.\\n\\nInstitutional pressures were captured in terms of\\ncustomers’ sensitivity to environmental issues and\\nthe intensity of government regulations.

Four weeks after\\nthe ﬁrst mailing, we sent a follow-up letter and an\\nadditional copy of\\nthe questionnaire to non-\\nrespondents. We obtained 150 usable questionnaires\\nfor a response rate of 47%.\\n\\nThe distribution of the ﬁrms in terms of industry\\nwas as follows: Food, Beverage, and Tobacco (29%);\\nForestry and Wood Products (11%); Paper, Printing,\\nand Publishing (11%); Textiles, Apparel, and Leather\\n(10%); Agriculture (8%); Machinery (8%); Chemi-\\ncals, Petroleum, and Plastics (7%).

In\\nsupport of discriminant validity, the squared corre-\\nlations between any two constructs are less than the\\nAVE estimates of the corresponding constructs for all\\npairs (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). We also assessed\\ndiscriminant validity by comparing the uncon-\\nstrained model to the constrained model and setting\\nthe correlation between two constructs to one. For\\nevery pair of constructs, we found a signiﬁcant chi-\\nsquare difference, which provides evidence of dis-\\ncriminant validity.\\n\\nitself\\n\\nindicated a good ﬁt\\n\\nAs we stated earlier, we conceptualized PES as a\\nhigher-order factor of pollution prevention and top\\nmanagement support. We performed a second-order\\nCFA for PES. We found that pollution prevention\\n(loading = 0.87, R2 = 0.87) and top management\\nsupport (loading = 0.76, R2 = 0.79) loaded signiﬁ-\\ncantly on the higher-order construct of PES and the\\nconstruct\\nto the data\\n2 = 186.2, GFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.94, CFI =\\n(v(76)\\n0.95, RMSEA = 0.06). The Cronbach’s alpha, com-\\nposite reliability, and AVE for the higher-order\\nconstruct of PES were 0.80, 0.81, and 0.63, respec-\\ntively. These ﬁndings supported that PES could be\\noperationalized as a higher-order construct of pollu-\\ntion prevention and top management support. In\\nfurther analyses, we averaged the scores of\\nthe\\nrespective sub-constructs (i.e., pollution prevention\\nand top management support) to obtain the measure\\nof PES.

Based on the results of this test and the\\ndiscriminant\\ntest results previously discussed, we\\nconclude that common method bias is unlikely to be a\\nthreat to our hypotheses testing.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nWe tested our structural model by following the\\nprocedures recommended by Bollen (1989) and\\nHayduk (1987). We set the measurement path esti-\\nmates at 1 and the error variance at the scale variance\\ntimes 1 minus the reliability to account for mea-\\nsurement error. Since our model depicts interactions\\nof entrepreneurial orientation with government\\nregulations and customers’ sensitivity to environ-\\nmental issues, we created interaction terms by mul-\\ntiplying the mean-centered values of the respective\\nvariables so that the likely threat of multicollinearity\\nis minimized (Aiken and West, 1991).\\n\\nThe structural model provided a perfect ﬁt to\\n2 = 20.40; GFI = 0.98; TLI = 1.00;\\nthe data (v(21)\\nCFI = 1.00; RMSEA = 0.01). The results of the\\nstructural model (Table III) indicate that entrepre-\\nneurial orientation is related positively and signiﬁ-\\ncantly to PES (b = 0.27; p < 0.001). Therefore,\\nHypothesis 1 is\\nthe\\ninteraction effect of entrepreneurial orientation and\\n\\nsupported. We found that\\n\\nthus\\n\\nthe intensity of government regulations was related\\npositively and signiﬁcantly to PES (b = 0.25;\\np < 0.01),\\nsupporting Hypothesis 2. The\\ninteraction effect of entrepreneurial orientation and\\ncustomers’ sensitivity to environmental issues was\\nnot related signiﬁcantly to PES (b = -0.02; ns);\\ntherefore, Hypothesis 3 was not supported. PES is\\nrelated positively and signiﬁcantly to sales growth\\n(b = 0.32; p < 0.01) and proﬁt growth (b = 0.31;\\np < 0.01). These ﬁndings support Hypotheses 4a\\nand 4b.\\n\\nTurning to control variables, environmental\\ndynamism is related negatively and signiﬁcantly to\\nsales growth (b = -0.18; p < 0.05), and ﬁrm’s size is\\nrelated positively and signiﬁcantly to both sales\\ngrowth (b = 0.50; p < 0.01) and proﬁt growth\\n(b = 0.58; p < 0.01).\\n\\nPost-hoc analyses\\n\\nWe conducted three additional analyses. First, our\\nmodel posits that entrepreneurial orientation, the\\nintensity of government regulations, and customers’\\nsensitivity to environmental issues are drivers of a\\nPES. It is plausible that there is reverse causality\\nbetween a PES and its drivers.

However, we perform a test of whether\\nthe model that posits entrepreneurial orientation, the\\nintensity of government regulations, and customers’\\nsensitivity to environmental issues to predict a PES\\nand, in turn, ﬁrm’s performance provides a better ﬁt\\nto the data (and, therefore, explanatory power) than\\nthe alternative model (i.e., a PES predicting entre-\\npreneurial orientation, the intensity of government\\nregulations, and customers’ sensitivity to environ-\\nmental issues and, in turn, ﬁrm’s performance). We\\nconducted a model comparison, using the structural\\nequation modeling technique. We compared the two\\nmodels based on: (1) model ﬁt (i.e., larger values\\nindicating better ﬁt or more explanatory power) and\\n(2) Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (i.e., smaller\\nvalue indicating better ﬁt).\\n\\n2 = 7.92; GFI = 0.98; TLI = 0.99;\\nPNFI = 0.39,\\n\\nThe results indicate the following:\\nModel 1: v(6)\\nCFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.07,\\nAIC = 37.92\\n2 = 68.93;\\nv(2)\\nModel\\nGFI = 0.89; TLI = 0.44; CFI = 0.80; RMSEA =\\n0.17, PNFI = 0.11; AIC = 106.93\\n\\n2\\n\\n(Alternative Model):\\n\\nThe ﬁndings suggest that the model which posits\\nthe intensity of\\nthat entrepreneurial orientation,\\ngovernment regulations, and customers’ sensitivity\\nto environmental issues predict a PES and, in turn,\\nﬁrm’s performance provides a better ﬁt to the data\\n(and, therefore, explanatory power) than the alter-\\nnative model (i.e., a PES predicting entrepreneurial\\norientation, the intensity of government regulations,\\nand customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues\\nand, in turn, ﬁrm’s performance).\\n\\nSecond, we tested to see whether entrepreneurial\\norientation actually plays a mediating role in the\\n\\n\\x0cInteractive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES\\n\\n293\\n\\nrelationship between a PES and performance.\\nTherefore, we followed the three-step procedure\\nrecommended by Baron and Kenny (1986). They\\nsuggest that the following conditions must be met to\\nestablish mediation. First (Step 1), the independent\\nvariable (i.e., PES) must be related signiﬁcantly to\\nthe mediator\\n(i.e., entrepreneurial orientation).\\nSecond (Step 2), a PES must be related signiﬁcantly\\nto the dependent variable (i.e., sales/proﬁt growth).\\nThird (Step 3), the mediator must be related sig-\\nniﬁcantly to the dependent variable (i.e., sales/proﬁt\\ngrowth). If these conditions all hold in the predicted\\ndirection, then the effect of a PES on sales/proﬁt\\ngrowth must be less in the third equation (when the\\nmediator is included) than in the second (when the\\nmediator is excluded). Full mediation holds if a PES\\nhas no effect when the mediator is controlled for\\n(Baron and Kenny, 1986, p. 1177). The results\\nindicate that a PES is related signiﬁcantly to entre-\\npreneurial orientation (t = 3.81; p < 0.001) (Step 1)\\nand a PES is related signiﬁcantly to sales growth\\n(t = 2.83; p < 0.01) and proﬁt growth (t = 2.61;\\np < 0.01) (Step 2). However, entrepreneurial ori-\\nentation is not related signiﬁcantly to sales growth\\n(t = 0.18; ns) and proﬁt growth (t = -0.10; ns)\\n(Step 3). Therefore, it is concluded that entrepre-\\nneurial orientation does not play a mediating role in\\nthe relationship between a PES and performance.\\n\\nThird, given that entrepreneurial orientation is not\\nrelated signiﬁcantly to performance, we tested to\\nexamine if the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on\\nperformance (sales/proﬁt growth) is intensiﬁed by the\\npresence of a PES (as a moderating variable). The\\nresults indicate that the interaction term of PES and\\nentrepreneurial orientation is related positively and\\nsigniﬁcantly to proﬁt growth (t = 2.05; p < 0.05) but\\nnot to sales growth (t = 1.94; ns). Therefore, we\\nconclude that a PES plays a moderating role in the\\nrelationship between entrepreneurial orientation and\\nproﬁt growth.\\n\\nWe elaborate on these additional ﬁndings in the\\n\\nnext section.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThis article draws on literatures from the RBV and\\nits derivations (e.g., the NRBV and dynamic capa-\\nbilities perspective), and from institutional and\\n\\nlegitimacy theories\\nto conceptualize and test an\\nintegrated model by examining the interaction be-\\ntween the internally and externally driven perspec-\\ntives on a PES. We also tested the long-debated and\\nmixed ﬁndings in the literature regarding the rela-\\ntionship between a PES and ﬁrm’s performance\\n(e.g., sales and proﬁt growth).\\n\\nAlthough the internally and externally driven\\nperspectives that explain a PES have developed in\\ntandem, the approaches have been mainly inde-\\npendent and mutually exclusive. That is, these two\\nperspectives on a PES, internal and external, have\\nbeen researched in a parallel fashion without due\\nattention given to the interplay between both views\\nunder a single model. As a consequence, rather than\\naccommodating the two in a direct effects model,\\nwe explore a contingency model and argue that the\\nintensity of government regulation and consumer\\nsensitivity to natural environmental issues moderate\\nthe impact of entrepreneurial orientation on a PES.\\nAs a consequence, the contribution of this article lies\\nin its investigation of the interactive effect between\\nthe internal and external perspectives on a PES.\\nFrom a theoretical contribution perspective, our\\narticle examines the interplay between the RBV\\nand institutional theory (and legitimacy theory) in\\nshaping a PES.\\n\\nNext, we discuss some of the implications of our\\nﬁndings. We ﬁrst discuss the main effect of entre-\\npreneurial orientation on a PES followed by how\\nthis is qualiﬁed by institutional pressures from the\\ngovernment and consumers. We conclude with the\\nperformance effect of a PES.\\n\\nWe found that a ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial orientation\\npositively affects the adoption of a PES. If a ﬁrm’s\\nenvironmental strategy is merely reactive as opposed\\nto proactive, an entrepreneurial orientation may not\\nbe needed. However, a PES demands that the ﬁrm\\nbe venturesome and audacious, take on risks, and be\\nat the forefront of innovative products and processes.\\nAragon-Correa (1998) also found that strategy type\\nor posture was related to a ﬁrm’s approach toward\\nthe natural environment in that prospectors were\\nmore likely to adopt a PES. Therefore, we can\\npostulate that one of the reasons a higher entrepre-\\nneurial orientation is more likely to lead to the\\nadoption of a PES may lie in the common organi-\\nzational culture, strategic posture, and structure that\\nboth require. From a RBV perspective, when a ﬁrm\\n\\n\\x0c294\\n\\nBulent Menguc et al.\\n\\nhas more resources and the capability to be entre-\\npreneurial, it is more likely to adopt a PES. Also, as\\nshown from our post-hoc analysis, entrepreneurial\\norientation did not have a direct effect on ﬁrm’s\\nperformance nor did it mediate the relationship\\nbetween a PES and ﬁrm’s performance. It was only\\nunder a PES that entrepreneurial orientation showed\\na positive effect on ﬁrm’s performance. This suggests\\nthat a PES complements the impact of entrepre-\\nneurial orientation on ﬁrm’s performance by\\nstrengthening the relationship between the two.\\nAlthough not part of our formal testing, future re-\\nsearch could examine alternative model evaluations\\nto assess whether a PES explains data better as a\\nmediator or as a moderator between entrepreneurial\\norientation and ﬁrm’s performance.\\n\\nNow, with regard to the outcome of the inter-\\naction hypotheses,\\ninterestingly, only intensity of\\ngovernment regulation and not consumer sensitivity\\nto natural environmental issues moderated the effect\\nof entrepreneurial orientation on a PES. As intensity\\nof government regulation increased,\\nthe positive\\neffect of entrepreneurial orientation on a PES be-\\ncame stronger. However, we did not ﬁnd that\\nintensity of government regulation had a direct ef-\\nfect on PES. Conversely, consumer sensitivity to\\nnatural environmental issues did not function as a\\nmoderator for the entrepreneurial orientation–PES\\nrelationship. However, we did ﬁnd that consumer\\nsensitivity to natural environmental issues had a di-\\nrect and positive impact on PES.\\n\\nThe direct effect of consumer sensitivity to natural\\nenvironmental issues on a PES is consistent with\\nlegitimacy theory and stakeholder theory in that\\ncustomers are among the most\\nimportant stake-\\nholders who exert inﬂuence and pressure on how\\nﬁrms respond to natural environmental issues (e.g.,\\nBuysse and Verbeke, 2003). In today’s business\\nenvironment, customers have the will and power to\\nhave a signiﬁcant effect on ﬁrm’s performance by\\ncurbing and altering purchase behavior, organizing\\nboycotts, and taking legal action to rectify irre-\\nsponsible ﬁrm’s behavior. From the ﬁrm’s perspec-\\ntive, acting in a socially responsible manner can\\nthe ﬁrm,\\nenhance the reputation and image of\\nthereby strengthening the social\\nits\\nidentity and existence in the eyes of customers.\\nTherefore, when customer sensitivity to natural\\nenvironmental issues increases, ﬁrms are more likely\\n\\nlegitimacy of\\n\\nto adopt a PES that satisﬁes and resolves the concerns\\nthat customers have about natural environmental\\nissues and strengthens ﬁrms’ social ﬁtness. The ab-\\nsence of a moderating effect from consumer sensi-\\ntivity to natural environmental issues suggests that\\nthe effect of entrepreneurial orientation on PES is\\nnot altered as consumer sensitivity changes.\\n\\nOn the contrary, intensity of government regu-\\nlation moderated the relationship between entre-\\npreneurial orientation and a PES. This suggests that\\nbuilding a PES based on entrepreneurial orientation\\nis effective when the intensity of government reg-\\nulation elevates. That is, ﬁrms that desire to adopt a\\nPES should ﬁnd entrepreneurial orientation a useful\\nmeans under high government regulation. Not-\\nwithstanding, intensity of government regulation did\\nnot have a direct positive effect on PES. Our results\\necho the ﬁndings of Henriques and Sadorsky (1999)\\nwho reported that not all stakeholders are equally\\nimportant and that some carry more weight than\\nothers. That is, governments may be a secondary\\nrather than primary stakeholder group in the New\\nZealand context. In fact, Buysse and Verbeke (2003)\\nfound that ﬁrms with a reactive environmental\\nstrategy attached signiﬁcant importance to stake-\\nholders such as domestic regulators and local public\\nagencies (although they also found that ﬁrms with a\\nprevention strategy attached even more importance\\nto such groups).\\n\\nOne of the reasons for the null ﬁnding may reside\\nin the nature of the New Zealand government’s\\nregulation policy regarding natural environmental\\nissues. Because New Zealand ﬁrms, on average, are\\nvery environmentally conscious, the vast majority of\\nthe ﬁrms in our data set may not need intense gov-\\nernment regulations to prompt a PES. Rather than\\nrelying on a bureaucratic institution such as the\\ngovernment to exert pressure, pressure may come\\nfrom trade associations or social community groups\\ninstead. This suggests that in markets such as New\\nZealand where natural environmental\\nissues have\\nlong been part of the strategic dialogue and are ﬁrmly\\nembedded in the social fabric of the ﬁrm, the role of\\nthe watch dog that monitors and reports violations of\\nirresponsible environmental behavior falls on the\\nshoulders of stakeholders such as customers or even\\nemployees (Buysse and Verbeke, 2003).\\n\\nOur ﬁndings also point to the importance of the\\nrole of the environmental industry life cycle as a\\n\\n\\x0cInteractive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES\\n\\n295\\n\\npotential driver to a PES (e.g., Russo and Fouts,\\n1997). That is, in markets where the notion of a PES\\nis well-established and accepted (i.e., in the maturity\\nstage as opposed to the infancy or growth stage), the\\ndirect inﬂuence of the government may shrink and a\\nshift in power and pressure to other stakeholders can\\noccur. Conversely, in markets where the concept of\\na PES is still novel and not widely disseminated (i.e.,\\nan infancy or growth stage), the government is likely\\nto play a bigger role in shaping and forming a PES.\\nOur results are also consistent with the study of\\nMitchell et al. (1997) in that in the New Zealand\\ncontext, a manager’s perception of the government’s\\nsaliency, which they deﬁned as the cumulative im-\\npact of power,\\nlegitimacy, and urgency, may be\\nminimal; this explains the absence of a direct effect.\\nOur ﬁndings also suggest that stakeholder impor-\\ntance and saliency may be driven not only by\\nmanagers’ attitudes, values, and time, but also by\\ndifferent cultural and social attitudes toward envi-\\nronmental issues (Agle et al., 1999).\\n\\nAnother implication of this ﬁnding relates to the\\nconcept of stakeholder integration (Rueda-Manzan-\\nares et al., 2008). As Rueda-Manzanares et al. (2008,\\np. 189) posit, ‘‘stakeholder integration capability helps\\nﬁrms proactively detect evolving trends around\\npreservation of the natural environment and engage\\nstakeholders such as consumers, local communities\\nand NGOs to generate knowledge about balancing\\ncustomer utility, economic development, commu-\\nnity welfare, ﬁnancial performance and ecological\\nconservation.’’ It is noteworthy that two different\\nstakeholders exert inﬂuence in very different ways:\\none as a moderator and the other as a direct effect.\\n\\nFrom a theoretical perspective, our ﬁndings sug-\\ngest that when ﬁrms have resources and capabilities\\nthat are compatible and valued by the broader\\nsociety as a whole, their contribution to strategy\\nadoption will be enhanced and appreciated. That is,\\nthe RBV can be an effective theoretical\\nlens by\\nwhich strategy adoption can be explained when\\nresources are not incompatible with the demand of\\nexternal stakeholders (e.g., consumers and govern-\\nment) and are legitimate from an institutional and\\nlegitimacy theory perspective.\\n\\nFinally, our ﬁndings provide strong support for\\nthe returns on a PES in terms of (a) sales growth and\\n(b) proﬁt growth. As the importance of environ-\\nmental management continues to occupy a primary\\n\\nposition on the agenda not only in business, but also\\nin political dialogues, the positive return on a PES is\\npromising as such ﬁndings provide greater motiva-\\ntion and incentives for ﬁrms to embrace a PES and\\nbuild their sustainable competitive advantage around\\nthis strategic posture. The adoption of a PES can be a\\ncatalyst for generating future growth opportunities\\nand creating untapped market space. Our ﬁndings\\ndemonstrate the positive effect of a PES on ﬁrm’s\\nperformance; however, this may be due to how PES\\nis perceived in the New Zealand market. More re-\\nsearch will be needed to identify whether such\\noutcomes are indeed the case in markets where PES\\nis less developed and prevalent.\\n\\nLimitations and future research\\n\\nAlthough we received support for all but one of our\\nhypotheses, our study is not without limitations. Our\\nlimitations also provide motivation for future research\\ndirections. First, Owing to the nature of cross-\\nsectional data, it is not possible to discern causality\\namong our constructs. For example, it is conceivable\\nthat more proﬁtable ﬁrms with slack resources may\\ninvest in a PES. Therefore, replicating and extending\\nour study using longitudinal data should be useful in\\nexplicating the causal relationships between constructs.\\nSecond, in our model, we limited the externally driven\\ninstitutional pressures\\nto customer sensitivity and\\ngovernment regulation intensity. It would be worth-\\nwhile to expand the stakeholder groups to include\\nnon-government organizations (NGOs), media, and\\nindustry/trade associations. Third, a promising re-\\nsearch area that deserves more attention in the future is\\nan examination of the process by which a PES has a\\npositive effect on ﬁrm’s performance. Much study has\\nbeen devoted to ﬁnding a positive return on a PES, but\\nhow this occurs is still not completely understood.\\nIdentifying the key mediating variables that form the\\nbridge between a PES and ﬁrm’s performance could go\\na long way in furthering our knowledge of this rela-\\ntionship. Along similar lines, clarifying when a PES\\nwill pay off in terms of growth and proﬁtability is an-\\nother area that deserves more attention as the adoption\\nof a PES may not be a wise strategic choice under\\ncertain conditions.\\n\\nFourth, both Hart (1995) and Aragon-Correa and\\nSharma (2003) concede that a PES that entails a\\n\\n\\x0c296\\n\\nBulent Menguc et al.\\n\\nfocus on pollution prevention demands a decen-\\ntralized structure. Thus,\\nthis argument could be\\ntested to see whether higher entrepreneurial orien-\\ntation is also expected to shape the structure of an\\norganization and if it is related negatively to cen-\\ntralization,\\nformalization, and departmentalization\\n(Matsuno et al., 2002).\\n\\nLast but not\\n\\nleast, previous\\n\\nresearchers have\\narticulated a typology of organizational culture in\\nterms of four types: clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, and\\n(Cameron and Quinn, 1999; Deshpande´\\nmarket\\net al., 1993). Future researchers may examine whe-\\nther a PES is likely to ﬂourish most in an adhocracy\\ntype of organizational culture where innovation, risk\\ntaking, adaptability, ﬂexibility, growth, new market\\nspace, and entrepreneurship are emphasized.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nOur study contributes to the natural environment and\\ncorporate social responsibility literature by concep-\\ntualizing and testing an integrated model of the\\nantecedents and consequences of a PES. Our ﬁndings\\nsuggest that entrepreneurial orientation has a positive\\neffect on a PES and that this effect is stronger as the\\nintensity of government regulation increases. Con-\\nsumer sensitivity did not have a moderating effect but\\nhad a direct effect. Furthermore, the performance\\neffect of a PES is realized in terms of greater sales\\ngrowth and proﬁt growth. In conclusion, under the\\nright combination of internal and external drivers, a\\nPES can beneﬁt sales and proﬁt growth, which, in\\nturn, can contribute to improved ﬁrm’s performance.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n1 This study has been approved by the university’s\\nethics committee and complies with the ethical stan-\\ndards outlined by the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAgle, B.

      "technology Hypothesis 1: Plants with commitment human resource systems will have better manufacturing performance than plants with control human resource systems. Hypothesis 2: Turnover will be higher in control human resource systems than in commitment human resource systems. THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT AND HYPOTHESES Testing the strategic human resource perspective first requires catego- rizing organizations into a meaningful typology of human resource systems. Finally, Hypothesis 3 states that the negative relationship between turn- over and manufacturing performance will be higher in commitment human resource systems than in control systems. Further, research progress on the human resource strategy perspective depends critically on the development of conceptually and methodologi- cally sound measures of the human resource system construct. In contrast, commitment human resource systems shape desired employee behaviors and attitudes by forging psychological links between organizational and employee goals. In addition, the study has shown that identification of human resource systems promises to add significantly to understanding the relationship between turnover and organizational performance.\n"
